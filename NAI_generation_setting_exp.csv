0,0.6,1.0,"The colony's central courtyard was a vast expanse filled with rows of identical low-slung buildings, each housing its own residents. The colonists' communal kitchens were open to everyone, so Nora picked up a tray and joined the line at one of the food stations. She took her place in the long queue behind two other people, both dressed in the same utilitarian uniform as herself.

The line moved slowly, but Nora didn't mind; she was used to being hungry. As the morning progressed, the cafeteria filled with more people, some of whom were already eating. A few glanced over at Nora as they passed her, but no one said anything. She felt their eyes on her, though, like invisible fingers trailing across her skin.

Nora finished her meal and returned to the dormitory, where she washed dishes and stacked them in the recycler for later use. She then grabbed a fresh set of clothes and headed back out into the courtyard.

A soft chime announced her arrival, and the door slid aside with a hiss. Nora walked through the threshold and stopped dead, mouth agape. The entire room was packed with people, most of whom were wearing the same bright orange jumpsuits as Nora. In the middle of the group stood a man in a dark blue suit. He had short, blond hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to bore holes through Nora's brain.

""Good morning, Miss Decker,"" he greeted her cheerfully. ""Please come in.""

Nora stared at him blankly. She couldn't have heard correctly. What was this?

The man smiled broadly. ""I'm your new supervisor, Dr. O'Donnell. I'd like to welcome you to the colony.""

Nora blinked. Her head was spinning with confusion. ""My... my what?""

""Your supervisor, Miss Decker,"" the man repeated patiently. ""You're joining our team. Your duties will be to maintain the colony's machinery, make repairs, and oversee its growth. I've been assigned to help train you in these tasks.""

He gestured toward a stack of papers on one of the tables. On top of the pile was Nora's contract. She stared at it dumbfounded. How could they possibly expect her to sign something like this? She didn't know anything about the Company or the colonists!",74.0,5.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
1,0.6,1.0,"The hallways were empty save for a few people hurrying to their duties. The colony's automated systems kept everyone fed and comfortable, but the colonists still had to do their own work. Most of the colonists were up early anyway, so Nora found herself alone in the corridors.

She walked briskly toward the mess hall. Her boots clanged on the metal floor as she passed the dormitories. At the end of the corridor, the communal showers waited. She slowed to a stop, looking over her shoulder at the closed door.

She heard the sound of the water first, then the faintest hint of voices. She recognized Nora's voice.

The sounds grew louder.

Nora stepped into the shower area, then turned back to the door. She reached out and knocked lightly. ""Eve?""

""Yes, Nora,"" Eve responded in a low, calm tone.

""I'm ready.""

""Come in, Nora.""

Nora opened the door and stepped inside. The shower room was large enough to accommodate several people at once. Three other women were already there, dressed in similar clothes. All three looked up from their conversation and greeted her with friendly smiles.

""Morning, Nora!"" one of them called.

The others chorused, ""Good morning, Nora!""

They seemed happy to see her.

""You're early this morning,"" another woman said. She smiled warmly as she spoke.

Nora didn't respond immediately, instead taking in the rest of the room. A row of cubicles lined the walls. Each contained a bed and small desk. The cubicles were separated by doors, which opened out onto shared areas.

The shower area at the far end of the room had been converted into a communal bathroom. It held two showers, one for each gender, plus a toilet and sink.

""I just got up,"" Nora explained. ""I couldn't sleep.""

""Oh."" The other woman's smile faded. She looked at the others in the room, then back to Nora. ""We should be getting ready soon. We have to finish our shifts today so we can leave on schedule.""

""Okay,"" Nora replied, though she wasn't sure what they meant. ""Where do I go?""",77.0,5.0,47.0,No TF Sampling
2,0.6,1.0,"The corridor outside the dormitory was narrow, its walls made of smooth, reflective metal plates. The ceiling was low and flat, the floors sloped slightly downward toward the center. Nora walked quickly to avoid falling on her face. She passed other colonists heading in opposite directions, each wearing their own version of a uniform and carrying their own personal loaders and tools.

Nora reached the mess hall at the far end of the hallway and turned left to walk through the double doors.

A wave of heat washed over Nora as she entered the large room, and she paused to let it wash over her. A long counter ran along one side of the room. In front of it were several rows of high stools that faced a row of small tables. On the wall above the counter, a clock showed the time.

The colony was located in a remote region where the sun never rose. This room was the only place Nora could get fresh air and sunlight. She took a seat at the nearest table, which was already crowded with two other colonists who had come to eat before starting work.

Nora fidgeted uncomfortably as she waited for her food. She knew from experience how much trouble the Colony Manager made when colonists skipped meals. Nora hadn't missed a meal in days, but that wasn't going to last forever.

She pulled out her tray and placed it on the tabletop. As she did so, the door behind her opened.

The man who walked in was tall, lean, and dark haired. He wore an olive drab uniform and carried himself with confidence. Nora didn't know him, but she recognized his bearing. The Colony Manager.

""Nora Decker?"" he asked. His tone was polite but cold. ""I'm Captain Michael Breen.""

""Yes, sir,"" Nora replied. She stood up to shake hands.

Captain Breen was a good ten centimeters taller than Nora. She had to look up into his eyes. It was unnerving, like looking at a stranger.",65.0,6.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
3,0.6,1.0,"The dormitory halls were quiet, the colonists asleep in their beds. Nora stopped at a small kitchen to grab a bowl and spoon. She found a few stale pastries left over from yesterday's meal. The colony had rationed food supplies as much as possible. There was little waste, but the colonists didn't have much to spare.

The dining hall was empty save for the two women eating alone at one of the long tables. Nora slid into the seat next to them, digging into her bowl. She chewed slowly while she watched the other woman eat.

""Morning,"" said the woman. Her name was Evelyn. She wore her brown hair cut short and neat. A pale scar ran across her cheekbone.

Nora nodded, swallowing her mouthful of mushy cereal. ""Hi.""

Evelyn finished chewing before speaking again. ""I don't know how you do it, Nora. I've been up since four, and my eyes are killing me.""

""It's not so bad,"" Nora replied. She kept her tone even. It was rare for anyone to complain about being awake this early. ""You get used to it after a while. And we're supposed to be working today, remember?""

Evelyn shrugged. ""Yeah. I'm going down to the power plant. I'll see if there's anything broken. You go on ahead and eat breakfast.""

Nora ate her last bite, set her bowl aside, and stood. ""Thanks. See ya later.""

She walked through the main hall into the corridor. The door to the dining hall opened behind her, and Evelyn stepped out. Nora turned back toward the kitchen and caught a glimpse of Evelyn's face.

A strange expression crossed Evelyn's features for an instant, then she smiled. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora paused. Something wasn't right. She glanced at Evelyn's eyes, which were blue and normal. Then Nora realized what was wrong with her vision.

Her eyes were red and glowing like those of a vampire.

Nora stared at Evelyn in shock, unable to believe what she saw. Her skin felt cold despite the heat of her body. A chill crept up Nora's spine, making her tremble.

""Nora? Are you okay?""

The woman who called herself Evelyn held out her hands. They weren't red and glowing like Nora's. They were pale and unmarked.",83.0,4.0,41.0,No TF Sampling
4,0.6,1.0,"The corridor outside her room was empty except for the automated doors at the end of each hall. The automated door guards were programmed to let anyone pass, but they also served as sentry points. They monitored the halls for intruders and opened the outer gates for colonists leaving the dormitories.

The hallway outside Nora's room was lined with identical rooms, their open doors revealing the small, utilitarian furnishings inside. She passed several other rooms where colonists slept in silence, their breathing a rhythmic sound like waves on distant shores.

Nora walked past the last door to the end of the hall, where she turned right and headed for the communal showers. The cold water would help wash away the lingering cobwebs from sleep.

She pushed through the swinging door and stopped short, surprised by what lay beyond it.

A large rectangular pool occupied the middle of the floor. A series of steps led down to a wide ledge around the edge of the pool, and along its side ran a long, thin bench with a row of lockers underneath.

Atop the opposite wall stood an automated showerhead, spraying water into the air in a gentle stream. A line of soap dispensers sat beside the locker area. Several more benches lined the walls on either side of the pool, and the far end was filled with a bank of toilet stalls.

The scene looked inviting, but Nora hesitated to enter the pool. It might be contaminated with the hive's filth.

In her mind, she envisioned a swarm of drones waiting for her in the deep waters.

With a sigh, Nora stepped over the threshold and lowered herself onto the bench closest to the showers.",91.0,8.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
5,0.6,1.0,"The halls were dimly lit by dim blue lights at intervals. Nora navigated along them, listening for the sound of voices. She passed a few colonists moving about their duties in the early morning hours, but none were awake yet. The only sounds she heard came from the corridor walls.

The hallways were lined with doors leading to different rooms. She stopped at one of the doors and pressed her ear against it, hearing nothing. With a sigh, Nora knocked on the door twice, waited for someone to answer, then opened the door to enter.

Inside was a small room with three beds and a communal bathroom. Nora turned around, surprised that no one had come to see who had entered the room. She walked back out of the dormitory and closed the door behind her.

She paused outside the entrance to listen again, this time straining to hear any noise coming from inside. A faint clatter sounded through the wall, followed by a muffled curse.

Nora crept into the room and peeked through the window beside the door. She saw an empty bed and a pile of clothing on the floor. But the clattering sound continued. Nora peered around the corner, but couldn't tell what was making it.

""Hey, you,"" Nora called out. ""I'm talking to you.""

The clattering ceased. There was a long pause, then a thump from the other side of the room. Nora winced at the sound of something heavy falling over.

A moment later, a pale, gaunt figure emerged from the shadows. It was thin, wearing tattered clothes and a stained apron. Its face was covered in dark stubble and its eyes were sunken and bloodshot.

Nora stared at the person for several seconds before she realized it wasn't a person.",85.0,5.0,49.0,No TF Sampling
6,0.6,1.0,"The corridors were empty, quiet save for the soft creak of Nora's boots. The corridor walls were a dull gray color with dark metallic veins. She felt her way along the wall, counting the doors as she passed them. She reached the end of the hall without incident.

Nora entered the main dining room to find it empty except for a lone figure at one of the tables. Sully sat alone, wearing a thick coat and hat over his hairless head. His long fingers gripped the table edge as he stared into space.

He looked up when Nora approached. ""Good morning,"" he said softly, then stood.

""Morning,"" Nora replied. She took a seat opposite him.

Sully nodded to her with a faint smile. He wore a pale blue shirt under his coat, the collar turned up around his ears. Nora noticed that his eyes were red rimmed.

Nora glanced away from him, looking toward the front door as if she could see through it and into the stormy weather beyond. She shivered.

""I'm going out."" Nora paused, uncertain how to continue. ""To check on something. I'll be back soon. We can eat together.""

She pushed her chair back from the table. Sully's lips twitched.

Nora gathered her jacket and left the room. She didn't look back.

Outside, she found an empty hallway and followed it to the exit. The wind blew hard, forcing her to take deep breaths before she stepped outside. Nora pulled her hood up over her head, then checked her wristwatch as she walked briskly down the path. It was 8: 30 AM.

The sun had risen only a few minutes ago. Nora squinted at the bright light and turned her face away, shielding her eyes with one hand. She felt exposed without sunglasses or goggles. But she knew they wouldn't work in this environment.

Nora followed the winding path out of the settlement, passing several more buildings until she reached the edge of the colony.",72.0,4.0,40.0,No TF Sampling
7,0.6,1.0,"The corridors were empty at this early hour. The lights blinked dimly, making the long hallways seem even darker than they really were. Even the ceiling panels overhead seemed to glow faintly.

Nora found herself in a large dining area where rows of tables were lined up in neat, orderly fashion. She took her place among the other colonists at a table near the front of the room. They sat silently as she scanned their faces for familiar ones.

Most of the colonists looked like her, but there were a few others. Some were older, some younger. Nora spotted several women and two men who didn't look like her at all. Most of them wore dark clothing, while a few had on brightly colored tunics. A handful of people had on the same kind of clothes that Nora did, but most of them were dressed differently.

Nora tried to count heads. There should have been thirty or so of them. But when she glanced around the room, she noticed that a couple of people weren't sitting with the rest. One man stood off in the corner by himself and another woman was missing.

She frowned as she tried to figure out what could be wrong. Something about the situation felt... off. She'd seen enough movies and holos to know how important it was for a group of strangers to stick together in a crisis.

But this wasn't a movie. This was reality. And the colony was on its own. The Company wouldn't come back for weeks.

Nora's heart beat faster as she remembered the last time she'd been alone in a hostile environment. It hadn't ended well.

""You're late,"" said a voice from behind her.

Startled, Nora turned and saw that the man who had spoken was standing next to the table. He looked like he belonged here. Tall and muscular, with short, dark hair, his skin was tanned and weathered. His eyes were a striking shade of green, and they seemed to look right through her.

He wore a loose shirt that hung open over a pair of tight pants.",77.0,5.0,53.0,No TF Sampling
8,0.6,1.0,"The hallways were dimly lit and empty except for Nora's footsteps. The colony's power plant hummed in the background, a steady drone punctuated by occasional bursts of mechanical whine. Her boots echoed loudly on the smooth flooring.

Nora paused to glance at the digital clock on the wall beside the door. Six thirty. She was early, but the colonists had already been up for hours. Nora didn't mind. A little extra time to get her head straight wasn't going to hurt.

The commotion from the command center reached her ears as she walked along the corridor. Voices shouted over one another. A few people were running through the corridors, carrying tools and equipment. More voices called out directions to each other.

Nora stopped outside the command center. She listened for a moment, then pushed open the heavy doors. Inside was chaos. People ran back and forth across the room, shouting orders and commands. Equipment clattered and whined. Nora stood in the doorway, unsure what to do.

The noise subsided into a quiet murmur. Nora stepped inside. The scene around her seemed unreal. She couldn't see anyone standing still. Everyone moved with purpose, but no two people were doing the same thing. One person sat at a table covered in schematics and maps. Another man paced behind him, muttering instructions under his breath. Two women bent over a computer console, their heads close together and fingers flying over the keys.

A woman wearing thick gloves grabbed Nora by the arm and tugged her forward.""Nora!""She looked down at Nora's face. Her eyes widened.""You're early! You missed the first shift meeting.""""I know,""said Nora. She shook her head, trying to clear it.""But I'm here now.""The woman squeezed Nora's forearm reassuringly.""Good. Come on, we'll need you in the garage.""""Garage?""""They've got a problem with one of the power loaders. We'll have to take it apart and fix it.""""Right,""Nora said. She followed the woman through the corridors.

The command center had a small garage attached to its outer wall. Nora hadn't noticed it before. The garage was empty except for an old, battered tractor-type vehicle. A thin layer of dust covered its wheels and tires.

The woman led Nora to a door in the back corner of the garage.",75.0,5.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
9,0.6,1.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by yellow lights that flickered overhead. The walls, floors, ceilings, and even the doorframes were made of metal plates welded together. A few small plants grew in pots at intervals along the halls to keep them from feeling too empty.

As she walked, Nora heard the distant sound of machinery and the hum of power tools. She stopped to peer down a side hallway where several workers were busily welding something onto the wall. In front of each worker was a large rectangular box that looked like a tool rack. One of the workers glanced up at her. He smiled as he saw Nora's confused expression, then continued his work.

She turned away, shaking her head in confusion. She'd seen this sort of thing before. Why didn't I know about these?

Nora shook her head again. Maybe there wasn't time to learn everything. She had no idea how many other things she would have missed.

But what if we're not prepared for anything else? What if some other problem comes up that we can't handle?

Her stomach rumbled. Nora started down the corridor toward the mess hall. She passed a door marked ""Maintenance."" It was closed and dark, but the faint smell of oil lingered. Nora tried to imagine what went on inside, but couldn't picture it clearly enough to make sense of the noises she heard.

The mess hall was open and bright with morning sunlight. Several workers sat at long tables, eating breakfast or talking quietly over their meal. Nora spotted the cook and a couple of helpers nearby. They were busy at the stove, stirring and flipping food as they cooked it.

Nora paused outside the doorway to get her bearings. The mess hall was located in one corner of the colony, near the hydroponics greenhouse. Past the mess hall, Nora could see rows of greenhouses that stretched out into the distance. A few workers milled around the greenhouse walls, tending to crops and watering plants.

The mess hall itself was long and narrow, lined with large metal plates that looked like cafeteria trays. Most of the tables were empty except for a handful of workers who ate alone, hunched over their meals and staring down at the table in front of them. Nora recognized several from her engineering class.

She stepped through the door and headed for an empty table. She picked up a tray and filled it with eggs, toast, bacon, and fresh fruit. As she sat down, Nora noticed the man sitting across from her. He was tall and thin, wearing a black uniform that fit him snugly.",74.0,6.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
10,0.65,1.0,"Nora paused outside the door to her dormitory and listened for movement inside. A few colonists stirred, groaned in their beds, or muttered indistinctly as they worked through another nightmare. The sound of the alarm was still ringing faintly from her room, but it faded quickly as she left the building.

The air in the hall was chill and dry, carrying traces of dust and vapor. Nora took a deep breath to clear her lungs, then turned toward the dining area.

Nora entered the large communal space. In the dim glow of emergency lighting, the tables were empty except for a single person sitting at one end.

Valentina Kern. Commander Kern sat alone, staring at her hands folded in her lap. Her eyes were shadowed in dark hollows, and her lips were pressed together tightly. She wore a long coat with a hood over her shoulders, despite the warmth of the day.

Nora hesitated. Valentina looked like a lost child waiting for a parent to notice her presence. But if Valentina wanted company, she would ask. Nora had been too preoccupied with work to talk to anyone else since arriving.

Nora stepped forward and cleared her throat. Valentina's head snapped up, and her expression hardened. She stood up abruptly and walked away without saying a word.

Nora watched the commander go, and then returned to her own quarters. The alarm was still going off in her room, but she ignored it. She'd get a new one soon enough.

Nora pulled on her boots and jacket, then left the dormitory and headed to the mess hall. Breakfast was always the same thing here. Bacon, eggs, toast, and coffee. It tasted like ashes in her mouth, and she didn't know why. She couldn't remember eating anything today.

As Nora approached the dining area, a thin woman with stringy black hair hurried out of an adjacent door. She wore a heavy coat over faded blue jeans, and carried a clipboard tucked under one arm.

""You're late,"" the woman scolded. ""Breakfast starts in twenty minutes.""

Nora frowned at the stranger. She had a tired look about her, like she hadn't slept well last night. Her eyes were red and swollen from crying, and her cheeks were gaunt.

Nora stepped aside to let the other woman pass, and then followed behind.",72.0,6.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
11,0.65,1.0,"The corridor outside the dormitories was dark and quiet except for the soft whirring of power loaders from the engineering bays. The halls were dim, but she could still make out the shapes of the other colonists. They slept in small groups in their rooms, a few of them sitting up to watch her pass.

She walked briskly along the hall, nodding at those who acknowledged her presence. A few of the women gave her curious looks as they noticed her boots, but most kept their eyes focused on the floor. She was used to it.

The smell of fresh coffee tickled her nose as she reached the end of the hallway. Nora peered into the cafeteria. Several tables were filled with people eating breakfast, but no one seemed to notice her. She turned back around the corner and continued down the long passage.

Nora's destination was the mess hall. It was located at the far end of the colony and separated from the rest of the complex by a wide walkway. She made her way through the corridors and stopped in front of the entrance, which was marked with a large blue door. The door had an electronic lock that required a code to open.

She looked up at the door. There wasn't much time before she had to leave for work, so she punched in her four-digit code. As soon as the door slid open, Nora stepped inside and locked it behind her.

The interior of the mess hall was bright and airy. The walls were lined with a variety of potted plants and hanging baskets. A wide table dominated the center of the room, and several chairs and stools surrounded it. The floor was tiled in dark gray ceramic, with a scattering of colorful rugs over the surface. At the back of the room, a counter provided seating and food service.

A few colonists sat at the table, eating breakfast and talking quietly. Nora walked up to the counter and placed her order. While she waited, she watched the other patrons. Most of them kept their eyes on the food in front of them, but a couple of people glanced at her as they passed.

12,0.65,1.0,"Nora made her way past the dormitories to the communal dining hall. The dimly lit interior was filled with the sounds of groaning stomachs. A few colonists were already seated at long tables, eating their breakfasts. Nora headed straight for a table near the back of the room where she could see the kitchen.

She took a seat next to a young man who looked like he had just woken up. He was tall, dark haired, and handsome with strong features. Nora liked him immediately but didn't know his name.

""Morning,"" she greeted him.

He blinked bleary eyes in response. ""Uh... morning.""

""I'm Nora,"" she said.

His brow furrowed as he tried to place her face. ""Oh, right, I remember now. You're the engineer who fixed the communications system last night. Nice work, Nora. That was pretty tricky.""

Nora's mouth quirked upward in a half smile. ""Thanks. It wasn't too bad.""

""Yeah? I mean, it was good work.""

Nora nodded and sipped her coffee. The hot drink warmed her throat on its way down. She looked around the room. Most colonists were still asleep or eating breakfast.

""What do you think of this place?"" she asked.

The man shrugged. ""It's okay. Not my thing. Don't really see the appeal myself. But if you're going to live out here, then you'll have to put up with a lot of things.""

""That's why they pay us,"" Nora said. ""We get paid for putting up with stuff.""

He chuckled. ""Good point. I've been meaning to ask you something. How come you're the only engineer on duty? Shouldn't there be two?""

Nora glanced at him in surprise, but he was already digging into his scrambled eggs.

""There were a couple of other engineers working last night,"" Nora said slowly. ""But they both called in sick today.""

He gave her an amused look. ""Sick? Seriously?""

She nodded. ""They're probably just getting their sleep in. They'll be fine.""

""Oh, I don't know. I can see them falling asleep right now and never waking up again.""

She couldn't see much in the way of furniture, but the walls were lined with shelves of canned goods, dried fruits, and other staples. The hallways were utilitarian, though. A few doors on either side led to the communal bathrooms, and at the end of each hallway was a large mirror, where Nora could check her appearance for the day.

A faint sound echoed through the halls as she walked toward the cafeteria. Footsteps? Was someone coming? Nora paused, listening intently. No. Just the wind. It whistled around the corners of the corridors.

Nora turned down another corridor that led to the mess hall. It wasn't yet open, so the only illumination came from a few emergency lights. She made her way slowly along the narrow passage, holding onto the wall and peering into the gloom ahead of her with both hands outstretched like a blind person.

The sounds grew louder. Nora stopped, wondering what they could be. She listened again, but heard nothing more. Whatever it was, it sounded as if it was moving away. As if it was going to stop.

Nora continued forward, the tension in her stomach building. She couldn't see anything now, but the noises were getting closer. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled.

She reached the end of the corridor and peeked out into the bright, expansive cafeteria. Empty. But the noise had been close. Very close. Nora glanced down at her feet, where she saw a small scrap of material caught between two toes. She bent down to pick up the scrap of cloth.

It was a piece of fabric. A shirt sleeve. Torn and stained with dirt. Her gaze followed the length of the arm down until she realized that the arm wasn't attached to the body. It lay in the middle of the floor.

A tall man in coveralls stood at one end of the long, rectangular room, leaning over a counter. He glanced up as she entered, then went back to work.

Nora wandered toward the far wall, trying to decide if she wanted cereal or eggs. When she got closer, she saw that there were no tables. Instead, the room was filled with small round plastic plates with blue and white patterns. The patterned plates looked like they'd been manufactured from sheets of thin, flat glass, but Nora knew better.

The plates were made of synthetic materials. They were sturdy, durable, and lightweight, but they couldn't hold food. And yet the colonists ate off them every day.

Nora stared down at the plates in confusion for a moment, then turned and left the cafeteria. She needed to find someone who could explain what was going on.

Nora walked over to the table, grabbed a tray, and took a seat at the end nearest the door. She'd never been in this part of the building before. It was different from the residential wing. More utilitarian, less colorful. Nora didn't know why. She just knew she liked it better here.

She poured herself a cup of coffee, then sat back to wait. Her stomach growled in anticipation as she surveyed the mess on her plate. Breakfast had already arrived. She picked up a fork and began eating.

""Oh, hello there.""

Nora jumped out of her skin. She looked down to see a young man standing behind her, smiling. He wore a plain blue shirt and tan pants with a belt. His hair was dark brown and his eyes were bright. Nora couldn't help but notice he had a nice smile. It made her feel safe.

""Um, hi,"" she said awkwardly. ""You startled me.""

He chuckled. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.""

""That's okay. You weren't too loud, anyway."" She glanced around. ""Where are your quarters?""

""Hello?"" She knocked lightly on the door. ""Nora? You in there?""

No answer.

She sighed, then rapped harder. ""I know you're awake. I can hear you breathing.""

There was no reply.

Nora frowned, feeling a growing sense of unease. She glanced back down the corridor, but saw only empty space. No one else seemed to be around.

What if I'm not alone? What if it's just an intruder who got into my quarters while I slept? But what would they want with me?

Nothing happened.

Nora swallowed hard and pushed open the door. A large, dark-haired man stood behind a desk, leaning against it with arms folded across his broad chest. He wore a simple white shirt, a pair of black slacks, and a tie. His hair was cropped short and he had prominent cheekbones and a long nose.

""Morning, Nora."" He nodded to her and continued the conversation. She watched him for a moment, then walked past, nodding politely.

She stopped again at the top of the stairs leading up to the engineering bays. The door was closed, but she heard voices coming from inside. She knocked lightly on the heavy metal panel.

""Hey, Sully. I'm going down to breakfast. You want anything?""

""No thanks.""

Nora paused in the hallway for a moment, watching him. His face was drawn and pale with fatigue. ""You look like you haven't slept well. Are you okay?""

He shrugged. ""I'll be fine."" He glanced at her, then quickly looked away. ""Thanks for asking, though.""

The rest of Nora's shift passed uneventfully. Her duties were routine, mostly maintenance and repair work. When she was finished, Nora went down to the cafeteria.

Nora sat alone in a corner table near the kitchen. She'd been here long enough that most of the other workers knew her by name, but she still felt an odd sense of anonymity. The colony was a small place, and she was one of only three women working there.

She picked at her food listlessly. She didn't feel hungry, even though it had been hours since the last meal.

A sudden hush fell over the dining hall. Everyone turned to look in the direction of the main concourse, where the sound came from.

Nora stood up and followed the rest of the people toward the center of the room. A tall man wearing a black jumpsuit strode down the middle aisle, his hands clasped behind him. He wore no helmet, and his dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail.

He stopped in front of the cafeteria door and waited for everyone to gather around him. ""All right, listen up,"" he said. ""I'm Captain Jacobo.""",78.0,4.0,47.0,No TF Sampling
18,0.65,1.0,"The colony's power plant stood at the center of the settlement. A wide, three-story structure, the power plant rose high above the surrounding rocky cliffs like a steel cathedral. It resembled a gigantic, boxy spaceship. The broad, flat roof was covered in solar panels, and two large exhaust ports flared along the front of the building.

Nora climbed the stairs to the second level. At the top, she entered the command center, where Sully sat behind a table cluttered with maps, charts, and data readouts. He looked up when he heard Nora enter.""Good morning, Nora,""he said, waving her toward one of the empty chairs around the table.""You're late. You've got five minutes.""""I'm sorry, sir. I was—I just had a lot to do before work today, so...""""And you can't sleep?""Sully asked sympathetically.""No, not really. So what did you need?""Nora glanced down at the sheets of paper scattered across his desk, then sighed.""These are my notes from last night's meeting. I wanted to make sure they were accurate.""""That sounds good,""Sully nodded.""But we'll get back to them later. First, let me ask, how are your quarters? Are they comfortable enough?""Nora frowned. The Company didn't pay for accommodation. Instead, it provided everything colonists needed: food, water, shelter, and utilities. But the company also insisted that colonists keep their quarters clean and in good repair, even though it wasn't mandatory. The dormitories were cramped, but Nora felt bad complaining about them since she was the only engineer among the colonists.

Nora thought about mentioning her concerns to Sully, but instead she shrugged and shook her head.""Fine, sir. I guess.""She picked up a sheet of paper off his desk and slid it across to him.""Here's the report on the malfunctioning power generators. We have three machines left, all of which are still working, but the rest are all out. The first two we can fix with a little time, but the third generator needs to be replaced. I think I know who can do it, but I'll double check.""""I see,""Sully murmured, reading over Nora's notes. She noticed he had a long, thin scar running down his right cheek and jaw.""How are things at the medical bay?""""Oh, fine, sir. I'll give you an update later.""",83.0,5.0,42.0,No TF Sampling
19,0.65,1.0,"The colony's common area was crowded with colonists, all dressed in their work clothes. Most were sleeping off the previous night's exhaustion, but the rest sat at tables or stood around talking. A few heads turned as Nora walked by, but no one spoke to her.

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the upcoming day. She hated this place. The colony was harsh and unforgiving. But she'd learned to put up with it. If not for the Company, there wouldn't be anyone left alive.

A tall man in a dark blue uniform approached her from behind as she passed through the crowd.""Good morning,""he said. His voice was raspy, like he hadn't slept well. He extended a hand toward Nora.""I'm Lieutenant Lyle.""Nora glanced at his hand, then back at him.""Lieutenant?""""Yes, I work in command center. You're new here, aren't you? How are you liking the job so far?""He wasn't young, but he looked fit and strong. Nora knew that he worked hard.

Nora nodded.""It's pretty rough, sir.""""You'll get used to it. We all do.""His eyes drifted away, looking out over the colony grounds.

The lieutenant turned his head toward her again as if just remembering something.""You know, there was an incident last night...""""An incident?""Nora asked, startled.

Lyle nodded slowly.""Last night we lost a scientist. Someone broke into the lab and murdered him. They stole some of our equipment. It was quite... unfortunate.""Nora swallowed, feeling her stomach clench. She'd been through enough incidents before. But this one hit too close to home.""What happened?""she asked.

Lyle grimaced.""We don't really know yet. The intruder must have been very good. He disabled our security systems. Nobody knows how he got past them or what he did when he was inside.""Nora's heart beat faster, but she forced herself not to let it show on her face.

The lieutenant looked back out at the colony.""Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. We've got better security now, and we'll find whoever killed him. But it's going to take us a while.""Nora nodded.",82.0,4.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
20,0.7,1.0,"The hallway to the dormitories was dimly lit and cold as she walked toward the front doors at the end of the hall. At the door, Nora paused, taking a deep breath and trying to calm herself. She could hear voices from the other side of the door.

""You're sure about this?"" Sully asked in a low voice.

Nora knew that voice. It belonged to a tall man named Jack. He was one of the colony's best engineers. The two had worked together many times on jobs, but Nora hadn't spoken to him since he'd become the colony's second engineer.

""Yes,"" Jack replied. ""I'm sure. I've been thinking about it for months.""

Sully sighed. ""Well, if you say so. But be careful.""

The door swung open with a bang as Nora pushed through. A blast of frigid air slapped her in the face. She shivered in shock, trying to catch her balance and steady her breathing as she took in the scene before her.

Nora's eyes widened at the sight of the room full of people. In the middle of the group, a small figure with short dark hair stood awkwardly, leaning against the wall. Her heart skipped a beat as she saw the young woman's face. It was Amy, an old friend who lived in one of the dormitories.

Amy glanced up at Nora and mouthed the words, ""Help me"" .

Nora nodded and stepped forward, trying to move slowly and quietly. When she reached the center of the group, Nora tried to speak.

""What is this?""

She was answered only by a chorus of gasps from those around her. Jack stared at Nora, his mouth hanging open in shock.

""That's Amy,"" he said finally. ""She doesn't understand what's happening.""

Nora felt a chill ripple through her body. She looked back at the girl. Her eyes were wide and glassy, but she made no sound. She wore clothes just like Nora did.",79.0,4.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
21,0.7,1.0,"A narrow hallway led directly to the cafeteria. The passage was dimly lit by recessed lights. A few colonists walked past her on their way to breakfast, but she ignored them and kept moving. She made it halfway to the dining hall when the door slid open and a man entered. He wore heavy black leather gloves, thick boots, and what looked like body armor over his clothes.

Nora hesitated. This was the first time someone had ever worn that much protective gear in the colony. She knew it wasn't necessary. But even if he hadn't been armed, there were other reasons why this guy might not be welcome.

He stopped at the end of the corridor to look around. His eyes darted left, right, up, down, and back again. Then he turned and went through the doorway.

Nora waited a moment longer for him to leave before following. She caught a glimpse of his face in the cafeteria's mirror as he passed behind her. It was dark, but she thought the stranger looked familiar.

She found her usual seat and sat down, waiting for breakfast to arrive. There was something about him. She could feel it. Something wasn't quite right.

The food arrived, and Nora ate mechanically, staring off into space. After a few bites, her thoughts drifted to the strange man who had come in. She remembered his eyes. They'd seemed so bright, yet cold and emotionless. That wasn't like anyone she knew. And that was only one of many things wrong with him.

Nora finished eating, shoved the tray away, and stood up from the table. She stretched before heading toward the restroom. On her way, she passed the corridor leading to the weapons shop. The door slid open, and a second man entered wearing heavy boots and body armor. He looked over at Nora as she passed. His eyes were a startling gray color, almost silver in the dim light.

He didn't say anything. Didn't acknowledge her presence. He just kept walking.

Nora paused outside the bathroom. She felt a chill run through her blood.

The hairs on the back of her neck prickled.

She turned and ran.",82.0,4.0,48.0,No TF Sampling
22,0.7,1.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists already up and about. Nora walked to the common area where she found a handful of people eating cereal and drinking coffee. She joined them at their table, accepting a mug from the server.

""Good morning,"" said the server. ""I'm Lianna.""

""Hi, Lianna. I'm Nora.""

Lianna smiled warmly. ""It's nice to meet you, Nora. Would you like anything else?""

""No thanks. That'll do fine.""

She took a sip of her coffee while Nora waited for the server to leave. After watching Nora for a moment, Lianna spoke again.

""You're the only engineer, right?""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah. I'm the best. The Company sent me here with this colony because they want me to fix whatever's broken so we can get back home. They pay us pretty well, but it doesn't cover everything. We have a lot of expenses on our own.""

""What kind of stuff breaks down around here? And how often does it happen?""

""Most of the systems are older than my grandparents. We use a lot of old machinery and technology, which isn't exactly cutting edge anymore. Our air filters don't work very well, for example. There aren't any real maintenance crews to keep things running smoothly.""

Lianna paused in her duties, giving Nora a sympathetic look. ""I'm sorry about the filter thing. It must be hard on you guys.""

Nora shrugged with a forced smile. ""It's okay. Nobody likes an inefficient system. But I'd rather deal with the bugs than the drones. Those things come out of nowhere sometimes. They just pop up from inside walls or under floors. They grab people, drag them off into their nests and kill them.""

Lianna grimaced sympathetically. ""That sounds awful! What do they eat?""

""People mostly. Sometimes other colonists. They even eat each other sometimes, if there's not enough food for everyone.""

Nora shuddered at the thought of a hive full of writhing bodies. She took another sip of coffee and watched Lianna finish her rounds, then turn to walk away.

Nora leaned back in her chair with a sigh. ""They're creepy. But they make good fertilizer. The Company is so pleased with us for growing so much food.""",88.0,5.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
23,0.7,1.0,"The dormitory hallways were dim at this early hour, but the lights blazed brightly when she entered the common room. The kitchen was empty save for a single cook preparing food in the large cooking area.

Nora walked up to the woman and tapped on her shoulder.""Morning,""she said.

The cook turned around, blinking blearily as her eyes adjusted to the low lighting. She was a middle aged white woman with short black hair cut into a severe bob. Her eyes widened as they took in Nora's dark skin, and then narrowed suspiciously.

She glanced over her shoulder toward the door.""What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to let anyone into the kitchen.""""I need breakfast, please.""Nora held out her ration card.

The woman blinked again in confusion.""Ration cards?""""Yes, ma'am.""Nora nodded toward the door.""If you're going to start serving breakfast, I'd like to get some food.""The woman looked confused for a moment longer before nodding and moving away. Nora watched her go, wondering if she could trust the older woman. But the cook was only too happy to serve Nora as soon as she returned. She got a bowl of hot cereal and a plate of bacon.

Nora ate quickly, pausing now and then to stare at the cook while she finished her meal. The woman never once asked why Nora had come in, nor did she try to stop Nora from eating. She was just grateful for the food.

After finishing, Nora wiped her mouth on a paper towel and left without saying anything more.

The dining area was busy with colonists, but there were still plenty of empty tables. Nora chose one near the front window to avoid being crowded.

The panoramic view through the windows offered nothing spectacular except the endless expanse of rocky wasteland, which stretched out into the distance as far as the eye could see. Only a few wispy clouds dotted the sky, and their white tips reflected starlight in a surreal display of cold light. Nora found herself mesmerized by the scene as she waited for her shift to begin.

A tall young man wearing a dark blue uniform came and sat down beside Nora.""Good morning,""he said as he set his tray of food on the table. His name tag read""Javier.""Nora nodded in response, watching him eat silently.",76.0,6.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
24,0.7,1.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by the red emergency lights set in the ceiling, casting the halls in shades of orange. The air smelled stale. She could see dust motes drifting in the pale glow from the overhead lights.

Nora headed for the kitchen, where she found her friends eating at a table. Sully was sitting on one side of the table, Valentina sat opposite him. They both looked up when Nora entered.""Good morning,""Valentina said, smiling warmly.

Sully nodded politely. He glanced around the room. His eyes lingered on the old and battered appliances. He shook his head slightly, muttering,""I swear. How can they do this to us?""Nora shrugged. The colonists had been complaining about their machines breaking down for months now. With so few spare parts available, repairs took longer than expected. It wasn't unheard of for a machine to break after only two weeks on the planet.

She sighed. She was too tired to care anymore.

They ate quickly, chattering as they tried to keep their minds off the job ahead of them. Nora was just finishing her meal when the alarm went off again. She jumped up with an annoyed snort and stalked out into the hall, pulling her jacket tighter around herself.

The halls were quiet. No sounds of footsteps or voices echoed through the corridors. The silence was unnerving.""Where's everybody?""Nora muttered, frowning at the lack of activity.

Sully pointed toward a door on the left. Nora frowned at him in annoyance.

He raised his hands defensively.""You know what I mean. Where are the colonists? There should be people walking around.""Nora looked over her shoulder. A dim glow came from behind a door across the corridor, but no other lights shone down the hall. She turned back to Sully and shrugged. He sighed, shaking his head.

Valentina spoke up suddenly.""I'm going outside.""""What?""Nora asked. Valentina smiled sweetly at her friend and continued,""It'll be fun. It always is. You'll see.""Nora stared at her, incredulous. Valentina grinned broadly.""Come on. Let's go check it out!""""Wait a minute,""Sully said, holding up a hand. He scowled at her.""Don't you think we need to find some weapons first?""",100.0,4.0,45.0,No TF Sampling
25,0.7,1.0,"She found Sully at the galley. The cafeteria was already bustling with colonists preparing their own breakfasts. Most were eating alone, but a few groups clustered around tables. One table held four young men and women, each wearing a white coat and sitting on stools in front of the long counter that served as the dining area's far wall.

Nora paused beside the entrance to the kitchen, looking for Sully. She spotted him across the room, standing behind the counter by himself. He wore a dark blue button-down shirt over a black vest with shiny buttons. His hair was slicked back into a tight, short ponytail, and he was chewing his food slowly.

Sully noticed Nora watching him, and gave her a nod. She nodded back, then made her way across the room toward him.

The cafeteria buzzed with noise. Nora passed through the crowd of colonists who stood in line waiting to be served. She scanned the menu on the chalkboard hanging above the serving counters, noting that breakfast options included bacon and eggs, pancakes, sausage patties, hash browns, fresh fruit, milk, orange juice, coffee, tea, and water.

Nora stopped in front of the counter and spoke to Sully. ""Morning, boss.""

""Good morning,"" Sully replied. He offered her a small smile, which she returned.

Nora watched him with an unreadable expression. ""I need to check out the farms today. Can you cover my shift?""

Sully hesitated. ""Sure. What do we have today?""

Nora looked at him quizzically. Sully wasn't averse to working late, but it was unusual for him to volunteer for extra shifts.

""It's just a quick look around the greenhouses. I'm sure I can find something else to do with our time.""

Sully frowned. He pursed his lips and thought about it. Then he sighed and nodded. ""All right. You're in charge. I'll leave you to it.""

He walked away, leaving Nora alone with her breakfast. She ordered a plate of bacon, eggs, and hash browns. As the food arrived, she dug into the meal.",87.0,4.0,38.0,No TF Sampling
26,0.7,1.0,"The air outside was brisk, but dry, despite its early morning chill. She turned toward the colony's central building where she knew the cafeteria was located.

As she walked along the hallway past rows of doors, a few people glanced up from their work. Some saw her and gave her friendly nods; others just looked away. The faces were worn and tired.

Nora kept her eyes forward, focusing on the path ahead of her rather than the people around her. After a while, the clack of her boots on the grating became the only sound. Nora reached the end of the corridor and began to turn right.

A sudden movement to her left caught her attention. Something black shot out of one of the side corridors, racing straight at her.

Nora's heart slammed into her chest as the thing pounced on her back, pinning her arms down. It had talons that dug deep into her shoulders and throat. Her face was buried in the creature's thick fur and she couldn't breathe.

Nora tried to scream, but the creature bit down on her neck and the pain overwhelmed her. She thrashed wildly under the weight of the beast, trying to throw it off, but it held her firmly in place with its claws.

Terrified, Nora stopped struggling. The monster's grip tightened around her throat until she felt her windpipe close. Her vision went dark.

The thing on top of her snarled. Its breath was hot and rancid, filled with the smell of stale sweat. Nora gagged. She could barely feel her hands.

Her mind flashed to the last time she'd been pinned like this. It was a nightmare from her childhood. The beast would kill her if she didn't do something fast.

She started to panic, and then she saw the knife on her belt. A surge of adrenaline kicked in, giving her strength. As the thing's jaws clamped down, Nora twisted the blade out of its scabbard.

She slammed the hilt into the creature's face as hard as she could. The impact knocked it back several feet. Nora scrambled free and ran for the end of the hallway where the cafeteria was located.",74.0,4.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
27,0.7,1.0,"Nora followed the corridor to the common area where the colony's mess hall was located. The place was dark except for a few lights dimly glowing through windows set high in the walls. This section of the colony was designed with a central concourse that connected each wing.

At one end of the concourse, a wide stairway spiraled up to the command center. At the other, a long table was arranged along both sides of the passage for dining purposes.

Nora found a seat at the table near the door. She sat on a stool while she waited for the meal to be prepared. A few colonists passed her on their way out of the mess hall, but no one said anything as they went about their day.

After Nora had finished her meal and cleaned up, she walked down the short hallway that led back to her quarters. Her boots clicked loudly on the metal decking as she hurried toward the stairs.

In her haste, she failed to notice a drone standing in the shadows of the corridor. It was tall and narrow with shiny black skin. The insectoid creature stood motionless like a statue until Nora rounded the corner and was out of sight. Then it began to follow her.

The drone crept after Nora silently, its head swiveling around to keep track of the human. It didn't want to risk being seen or heard. So it stayed close enough that if Nora turned, she would see it right away.

Nora paused when she reached the bottom of the staircase leading up to the command center. She looked over her shoulder at the hovering, silent drone. A chill rippled through her body, followed by a wave of nausea. She felt sick.

Nora swallowed hard and took the steps two at a time, hurrying up the long stairway. The drone followed. Nora's heart pounded in her chest. Her palms were sweating. Her mouth was dry. Her stomach churned.

She climbed the stairs with every step feeling like she was going to throw up.",73.0,5.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
28,0.7,1.0,"She made her way past the dormitories to the communal kitchen. Her boots clacked along the tiled floors as she walked, leaving behind damp footprints that quickly dried in the morning chill. The air was sharp and crisp and the sun's rays were still pale.

The kitchen was a long, narrow room with large, glassless windows at either end. One window looked out onto the desert, and the other opened up to the hills beyond the walls of the colony. Sunlight reflected off the windowpanes, making the interior appear brighter than it actually was.

There was no one else around, but Nora knew that wouldn't last for long. The colonists woke early to begin their day. They'd be filtering in from the dormitories soon enough.

Nora paused, looking out the window toward the desert. She could see a few people walking in the distance, but the view was obscured by the rolling fog. A drone circled overhead, and Nora shivered. She hated drones.

She went back to the kitchen and filled a mug with water, then poured herself a tall cup of coffee. After several minutes of brewing, she carried her drink out into the common area. The room was so cold that condensation formed on the inside of the mug and frosted over the rim.

Nora pulled her chair close to the window, sitting down as far away from the door as possible without leaving the table. She took a sip of her coffee and gazed out at the desert. She tried not to think about the danger lurking just beyond those hills.

Nora had grown up in a small town in Indiana, where everything was familiar. There were only two main roads leading out of town, and the rest of the place was farmland that grew corn and soybeans. She'd never seen anything like this planet before coming here. It seemed so different from Earth.

But it wasn't the same as a new world. This planet was the same age, after all. Nora knew how to work with what she had available. That's why she excelled in engineering—she made do with what she had.

Nora took another sip of coffee and looked out across the fields, trying to get her thoughts organized. Her mind drifted back to when she first arrived. She remembered being overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place. It was an imposing sight, even from a distance.",88.0,6.0,53.0,No TF Sampling
29,0.7,1.0,"At least the air smelled fresh outside, even if it was still cold. A foggy haze blanketed the landscape, obscuring the sky overhead. She could see only a few meters in front of her, but she didn't need to worry about being lost. The colony's layout was simple and well known.

The first thing she noticed when stepping out of the dormitory were the lights. Each dorm was dimmer than the last. At the end of each hall, the lights were at their lowest level. Nora had always wondered why the colonists kept the lights so low, knowing full well that it would make night activities difficult. She figured it must be for safety reasons.

But now she knew what they did to conserve energy. If the lights went out, the colony wouldn't know. She'd have to find the nearest generator room and hope there wasn't a fire or something worse going on. And Nora didn't like those odds.

She shivered. She wore thick gloves, a hooded coat, and the heavy utility pants. But it was still too cold for her bare feet. With a sigh, she trudged back toward the dormitories.

She entered the command center and took a seat in front of the computer console, which glowed with an amber light. It was the only functional terminal available here in this part of the complex.

With a few clicks of her fingers, she opened the door to her personal data files and accessed the Company's records. She skimmed through the files, looking for the most recent communications. There was no way to filter them by time or priority, but Nora found what she wanted.

There. The latest message from Company headquarters. She opened the file.

Dear Dr. Decker,

We are pleased to inform you that your position has been upgraded to Chief Engineer. You will report directly to me upon your return from your scheduled leave.

Sincerely,

Sully Carmichael

Nora stared at the words for a long moment before closing the file. Then she typed in her password and opened the next file. This one was dated three days ago.

The first thing she saw on the screen was a video message. It showed a middle aged man with thinning hair standing behind an ornate desk. His eyes were gray, his skin pale and wrinkled. He looked ill, but Nora knew he wasn't sick.

He wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and a black tie.",84.0,5.0,48.0,No TF Sampling
30,0.75,1.0,"The communal dining area bustled with activity. Some colonists had arrived earlier than others to beat the heat; Nora saw two men and a woman seated at one of the long tables. The table held plates piled high with food, the aroma filling her nostrils as she passed it.

She paused in front of the entrance to the dormitory and glanced around. Other colonists were beginning to filter in, but they were a few minutes behind Nora. Most were still asleep, heads lolling on their chests like the sleeping animals from the jungle scenes depicted in old films.

Nora looked toward the stairs leading to the second floor where the colony's infirmary was located, then turned back to face the doorway. The hallway beyond it led deeper into the structure. A quick glance up and down the corridor showed her a couple of people passing along it.

There weren't many other colonists awake yet. Nora headed for the dining room, which was bustling with activity despite its relatively sparse population. At first, Nora felt a little awkward about entering the room while everyone else remained in bed. She considered turning back again and going to the cafeteria instead, but she needed to eat something before leaving the colony or she would get too weak. Besides, the mess hall had better food.

As Nora entered the dining area, a short, stocky man with dark skin and thick hair cut short in front caught her attention. He wore the same kind of coveralls Nora did; they hung loosely on him, showing his muscular frame beneath. His face was sunburned and he carried an energy drink can in one hand as he walked past the long tables to a counter at the far end of the room.

Nora watched him go without thinking, but when she looked up from behind a plate full of bacon and eggs, she saw another man standing across from her. He wore a white lab coat over a pair of black trousers.

The older man looked back at Nora without speaking, his eyes cold and hard. She knew he blamed her for the Colony's problems—and rightly so.

Nora kept to herself while she made her way through the colony, working quietly and efficiently to fix problems where she found them. This was her job. Her duty to the community.

Nora Decker. Born on Earth, raised on Mars, and now living on Presley's Promise with a handful of other colonists. She wasn't one of the Company's employees, but they'd saved her life when her ship crashed out here three years ago, and now she owed them for that. But as much as she liked the idea of being paid to do what she loved, Nora didn't really expect it would come to pass anytime soon.

The colonists were still just beginning to understand how well-developed the alien hive was. It had been dormant since the arrival of the colonists, who hadn't seen any evidence of it before then. But even though it had stayed quiet for years, it wasn't dead. There was always a chance that the hive might be reawakened again, and if that happened...

She shuddered at the thought, and kept moving.

Nora paused outside her lab to look up and down the hallway. All clear. She pushed open the door and stepped inside. A lone light bulb hung from a wire in the ceiling, casting harsh shadows around the room. The air was hot and humid, and carried the smells of ozone and antiseptic. Nora breathed deeply as she turned her attention to the equipment that filled the room. Her engineering team did a great job maintaining the power plant and generating enough electricity for the colony's needs, but there wasn't much else they could do about their own systems.

A few minutes later Nora entered the command center for the main operations deck where Sully sat at a console watching the feed from the security cameras and listening to reports. He glanced up when he saw Nora enter the room, then rose with a smile to shake her hand.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted him cheerfully. ""How's your shift going?""

Sully shrugged noncommittally. ""The usual. I'm sure you've noticed.""

Nora nodded. ""I know. It's always busy on the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels of the colony.""

He gestured to the screen showing a view of the corridor outside her quarters. ""You're not kidding. That swarm of drones is still out there. They won't give up.""

""They'll get bored eventually,"" Nora assured him. She watched as one of the drones wandered around the corner. The sight made her shiver. She felt like she could feel its barbed tail probing for a weakness in the hull.

The drone was a large, black insectoid thing with dozens of jointed legs and an oval body covered in thin scales. The creature looked vaguely humanoid but was built for speed and aggression. It walked on two legs, but the other four limbs were thick, multi-jointed, and tipped with a nasty looking set of curved talons.

The drone waddled toward Nora's door, swiveling its head from side to side as if it sensed something that had spooked the rest of the swarm. When it reached the door, it stopped and raised a front leg up to tap on the wood paneling.

""What the hell?"" Sully muttered. ""It can't open the door.""

The air inside the dining area was warm and stale but not hot. Nora could feel moisture on her face from the misting overhead vents, which she hoped would clear soon enough for them to heat up the water. The lights were dimmed. Most colonists only used the lights when they slept or ate, saving power until their needs demanded it.

Nora found the door to the cafeteria, entered, and walked toward the long, curving tables. She could see the end of one table where several colonists sat together around a large, round machine. Its surfaces glowed softly blue in the muted lighting. Nora couldn't make out any details other than that it looked like a computer.

She sighed. The colonists had been working on repairing or replacing it since the last supply ship arrived two weeks ago. With no new equipment coming in, Nora's job was to keep the old stuff going.

As she approached, Nora heard conversation between the colonists break off and then resume. She paused at the end of the table. They didn't look up as Nora moved past them. One man spoke quietly, so Nora leaned closer, trying to hear him over the hum and whirr of machinery. His words were indistinct.

""The drones are back,"" he said. ""I don't know what they're doing. There shouldn't be more than ten in this area.""

Nora tensed. The drone was an aggressive and voracious creature. She knew that from the Company database. Drones attacked the colonists without provocation, hunting and killing them indiscriminately.

The man continued his low voice. ""... I think we've got it under control for now though.""

That didn't sound good. Nora frowned and edged her way along the table. The other colonists looked up at her, startled when they saw her approach.

She caught one of their gazes and hesitated.",77.0,5.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
34,0.75,1.0,"Nora had just finished buttoning up when the chime sounded again. The door slid open to reveal a tall man in dark slacks and a white, short-sleeved shirt. His skin was dark and tan, with deep lines around his eyes. He had thick black hair, and a strong jawline beneath full, expressive lips.

He smiled at her, but Nora did not return the gesture. She stared back, looking for signs of deception. But Sully's expression showed nothing beyond friendly curiosity.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I don't have time to show you around the colony today. This is a big day.""

Nora nodded, still wary of him. ""You're leaving?"" She felt an unexpected stab of disappointment.

Sully shrugged, then gestured down the hall. ""There are other people who want to see this place, too. We're all eager to make a living out here, aren't we? And the Company will be sending ships soon enough. But before they arrive there's something important we need to do.""

Nora followed him through the corridors of the colony, past a handful of sleeping colonists, and into the main concourse. A few people were already gathered at a long table near the far wall, taking breakfast from metal trays. Most of them looked up as Nora and Sully entered.",81.0,5.0,47.0,No TF Sampling
35,0.75,1.0,"The corridor outside the dormitory was empty, but at least it wasn't cold. The temperature dropped precipitously as one moved farther from the heat source of the fusion plant.

Nora walked the length of the hall, stepping around clusters of laundry bags piled along the walls where the colonists shared their dirty clothes. She reached a stoplight junction of three corridors. One led to the cafeteria, another to the mess hall, and the third to the garage.

This section of the colony had been built underground to protect the human population from the dangerous environment above. The tunnels were long and twisted, leading from the command center deep into the rocky crags where they emerged in several places near the surface.

Nora hesitated for a moment before turning into the tunnel that would lead her toward the garage. She didn't want to go this way today. If she went straight down to the garage, it wouldn't take more than a few minutes to get there. But if she headed up the tunnel, she'd be lost in the maze of twisting passageways.

She made her decision. Nora turned into the tunnel and followed it deeper into the dark.

The narrow, curving corridor was lit only by occasional glowing strips along the ceiling where emergency lights burned despite the fact that power was out elsewhere on the complex. The air was close, thick with stale smoke and dust from ancient equipment. Nora coughed once or twice, but at least the stench masked the smell of the eggs.

Ahead, she could hear water dripping somewhere deep within the rocks. The sound grew louder until it became a steady stream. She moved faster, eager to reach the next junction and escape from the claustrophobic tunnel.

Nora stopped short when she rounded a corner. A wall of green slime blocked her path, oozing up over the floor like an ugly carpet. At first glance, she thought it looked like fresh vomit. But the color and texture were wrong.",81.0,7.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
36,0.75,1.0,"The hallways were quiet as she walked past empty rooms on either side. The dormitories had already been cleaned up for the day, and their occupants gone back to work. A few colonists slept in the rec rooms where they could, but most worked. Some of them stayed late. Most didn't.

Ahead of her was the mess hall. Its long tables were covered by red plastic sheets. Nora paused for a moment, wondering what the other colonists ate. In fact, she wondered if any of them ever got fed at all.

There was another option available to her. She could go to the cafeteria where most people ate, but only after she had eaten. She was so hungry that she didn't care.

After walking through the door, Nora found herself in an immense room with many tables lined with chairs. There were no windows, just a few lamps providing dim illumination from the ceiling.

It smelled like food.

Nora entered cautiously. Her eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light as she scanned the crowd of humans filling the dining area. Everyone was wearing coveralls and hard hats, some even carrying tools. But nobody appeared to be doing anything productive. They all sat there staring blankly into space or down at their hands.

They looked so similar, it was impossible to tell one person from another. Their faces were pale white and lean. Their hair varied from short to shaggy. All of them were thin, except for the few who stood out as noticeably overweight.

Their eyes all looked dead. No one was smiling or talking. Even when a few colonists began singing, the sound seemed forced. The words sounded odd in this setting; they weren't familiar songs. It was almost unsettling to hear voices raised at all.

The silence made Nora uneasy. She had never seen so many people act so... vacant.

A woman walked past her, then another man. Both wore coveralls, but neither of their clothes fit them. They were loose around the waist and shoulders. And both of them had dark circles under their eyes.

Nora stared at the pair, wondering if she should ask about them.",87.0,5.0,49.0,No TF Sampling
37,0.75,1.0,"The colony's main hallway led to a long central corridor where a handful of colonists met each morning for breakfast. The hall was wide, well lit, and filled with the sounds of footsteps and voices as people walked along its length. At the far end, the hall emptied into the command center.

Sully stood at the front desk, which was manned by a tall, thin man named Gage. Sully nodded at Nora, and then turned to greet two Company executives who entered through the opposite door. They were both older men in their forties with graying hair and neatly trimmed beards. Both wore crisp white shirts, dark slacks, and black leather shoes. They looked like they had been freshly groomed and dressed for the occasion.

They greeted Sully with polite smiles. When Nora approached, the taller one said,""Good morning, young lady.""His voice was deep and smooth, a contrast to his sharp features that reminded her of an eagle.

Nora responded with a quick curtsy. She knew he would find it odd, but she couldn't help herself. There was something about the way he spoke that made her feel small and unimportant even though he didn't seem to notice. It wasn't arrogance, just confidence born of experience and authority.

Gage was a lot more approachable than Sully, though he still managed to exude a professional air. He took the papers from Nora's hand and set them on the counter, then checked the system's log and logged her in.

She nodded at the two Company representatives as they left to get their own breakfast. Gage asked,""Is there anything else you need, Miss Decker?""""No, thanks.""Gage waited for her to leave before turning back to his work. The colonists were an informal group, so no one bothered with formalities like titles or surnames. Nora just called everyone by first name.""You're late.""Sully gestured at the clock over his desk.

Nora glanced down. The time displayed was ten minutes past eight. She'd overslept, but she hadn't realized how much time had passed until now.",69.0,6.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
38,0.75,1.0,"The halls were empty, but the corridors still echoed to the sound of her footsteps as she hurried to catch up with the rest of the colonists. The Company had set up separate shifts for everyone in the colony, so Nora was one of just two people awake at this early hour, and the only one not already working.

She caught the scent of food from somewhere ahead. The smell was faint but tantalizing. Nora wondered if the Company had stocked up on supplies to keep their staff fed during the long winter months.

A few minutes later, a door opened to reveal the commissary. A line of colonists was waiting outside, looking more like refugees than prospectors or explorers. They shuffled along with slumped shoulders and drooping heads as they moved through the doorway into a narrow corridor that led deeper inside the colony.

Nora hesitated, wondering what the colonists did for entertainment here when there wasn't much else to do. She hadn't really thought about it before because she'd been too busy focusing on surviving.

But now, she found herself curious. As Nora waited in line with the other colonists, she watched them enter and begin picking over stacks of metal trays piled high with food items. These were their meals for the day. The Company provided rations, but everyone had to choose their own food from the many options available.

Nora eyed the trays and realized most of the colonists preferred protein bars. These came in a variety of flavors, some made from dried meat, nuts, grains, and vegetables. Some even contained bits of chocolate.

The Company had stocked up on supplies to last the colonists until the next supply ship arrived, but that didn't mean they could be picky. Nora's stomach gurgled at the prospect of filling her empty belly.

Nora glanced around at the other colonists. They looked exhausted, hungry, and generally depressed. A couple of the men were nursing wounds from yesterday's attack. The colony had been attacked twice before.

After a few moments, Nora approached the counter and took the topmost tray. She held it up to scan its contents and found nothing objectionable. Satisfied with her choice, she stepped back out into the corridor and headed in the direction of the nearest hydroponic greenhouse.

Nora had volunteered to take this shift because she was good with electronics and had a knack for fixing things. But now, with the sun barely over the horizon, she needed to use every minute of daylight while it lasted. She hurried down the corridors and rounded a corner when a small drone popped up out of hiding near her feet. It scuttled forward, raising itself up on its spider legs. Its carapace glittered like polished silver as it raised a clawed hand at Nora in warning.",78.0,8.0,47.0,No TF Sampling
39,0.75,1.0,"The colony's central kitchen was a long, rectangular room filled with counters and sinks running along the walls and a single large serving table in the center. The floor was tile, and the ceiling had been painted white to reflect the morning sun. A row of walk-in cupboards stood at either end, stacked high with dishes and foodstuffs.

A few colonists were already there, sitting around the table drinking coffee. Nora joined them, grabbing a cup from one of the shelves. As she walked over to the counter and filled the cup with hot water, she watched two women chatting nearby. They wore the same utilitarian clothing as her, but theirs were slightly more fitted.

The taller woman caught sight of Nora, smiled, and said something that made the other woman laugh. The first woman waved goodbye, then turned back toward the table to finish what they'd been talking about.

Nora wasn't sure why she felt so awkward in her own skin. She liked people, especially friendly ones like these women. But it was hard not to feel exposed in her utility clothes. The fabric kept away the cold, but the seams left little to the imagination.

She took a deep breath to steady herself and reminded herself that she was safe for now. These women couldn't see through her clothes, and no one else had yet come into the kitchen.

The water boiled, and Nora lifted the steaming mug to her lips. Hot coffee flooded down her throat, and she sighed appreciatively. The bitter flavor woke up her taste buds and settled her stomach. The ache of hunger dulled.

She leaned over the counter, watching the women talk and laughing together. One of them, a short brunette with curly hair, glanced at Nora before she turned back to the other woman. She smiled when she saw Nora looking, then looked away again quickly.

The other woman noticed her attention, too. She flushed, said something, and laughed nervously. Her friend rolled her eyes, but she still chuckled. Then the taller woman spoke up, making the shorter woman look even more uncomfortable.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora mumbled to herself. ""It's just..."" She trailed off.",82.0,6.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
40,0.8,1.0,"The corridor outside the dormitories was lit by bright yellow lights strung along the ceiling like luminous vines, but the rest of the hallways were dark. The dimly glowing lights were too feeble to illuminate the dust that hung in every corner and crusted across the low overhead panels.

It made sense for a colony so far from human space to run on the same power grid that kept the cities of Earth running, but it was always odd to see such an advanced society fail to adopt modern conveniences.

In the distance, the steady rumble of machinery echoed through the complex. That was the source of the noise Nora had heard earlier when she woke up. She turned her head to peer down the dark corridor toward the command center. Her eyes adjusted enough to make out the faint glow of the monitors in the office at the end of the hall.

She passed the large dining room, where colonists ate communal meals together, and descended a long flight of stairs into the lower level of the building. The first floor was crowded with corridors leading away from the stairwell.

Nora headed down one hallway, passing darkened offices and empty conference rooms, until she found the door that led to the cafeteria. She pushed it open and stepped inside. The lights were off, but the table lamps glowed weakly and cast a dim red light over the deserted room. Nora moved forward to check out the food dispensers as she took stock of the other inhabitants.

The only person present was a man sitting in one corner. He sat slumped in his chair, staring at nothing. As Nora approached, he glanced at her with dull eyes and then looked away again. Nora knew him from the infirmary.

""Good morning,"" she said quietly. ""I'm here to get my breakfast.""

He didn't answer.

Nora sighed. She opened her menu and began scrolling through the selection of items available. The list was divided into three categories: proteins, carbohydrates, and fruits/vegetables. A healthy option for each category would give her more energy than just a sugary snack.

Protein options included meats such as beef and pork, along with various cuts of fish. Carbohydrate choices ranged from whole grains like bread to starchier foods like potatoes. Some vegetables were also listed as an option in the protein section.",94.0,8.0,45.0,No TF Sampling
41,0.8,1.0,"The dormitory hallway seemed darker than usual. The ceiling lights were off, and the walls glowed faintly blue-green in the faint light from the star outside. Sully was already at the entrance to the mess hall, where he stood chatting with a couple other colonists. He looked up when she came out of her room, smiled briefly, and nodded.

She passed him by without acknowledging his presence as she headed for the cafeteria and food.

The dining area had been built inside one of the largest greenhouses. A long table filled the entire space with enough room left over for several dozen seats. Several of the chairs had been shoved against the wall to accommodate tall tables. All around the perimeter of the greenhouse, shelves held dozens of glass pots holding seedlings in different stages of growth.

Nora sat at the end of the rightmost side of the long table and opened her plate with a practiced motion, setting it down next to her fork. She poured herself a cup of water from the pot beside her chair and took a slow drink while she waited for the meal to arrive.

The lights dimmed as the doors slid open. The first thing Nora noticed was the absence of any other colonists. Then, she spotted the cook and dishwasher coming through the swinging door. They both wore crisp white uniforms and stood aside to let a couple people pass them by before they entered the room.

Nora frowned as she watched them enter and take their places at the far end of the table. She was too early for breakfast, but it didn't matter; the kitchen crew were already serving themselves. As they did, one of them looked up. Their eyes met for just an instant. There was something wrong about the look on her face...

Something that made Nora pause with the fork halfway to her mouth.

Her instincts kicked in. In a single motion, Nora snatched her plate out of its place, turned away from the table, and fled into the hallway, dashing past Sully as she went.

""Nora!"" he called after her. ""Where are you going?""

She ignored him as she ran down the hall, heading toward the elevator.",78.0,6.0,47.0,No TF Sampling
42,0.8,1.0,"The hallway outside the door was dimly lit by recessed lights. The hum of machinery made it hard to hear over the background noise from the colony. It also reminded her of the first time she came through the main entrance. Then she was fresh out of school, anxious to prove herself as an engineer. Now she was responsible for keeping them alive on this desolate planet.

It seemed like a lifetime ago.

She passed several colonists, each going about their own business. Their faces were dark in shadow, illuminated only by the occasional gleam off reflective surfaces. They wore sleeveless shirts, long pants, and sandals instead of boots. They all looked up at her, some with surprised expressions, others with wary suspicion.

Nora frowned as they watched her pass. It wasn't fair that they should stare when she had to work so hard. She tried not to feel self-conscious and continued down the corridor. At the end, she stopped and turned to check in both directions. When there was no sign of any aliens lurking around the corner, Nora started again.

Her footsteps echoed faintly in the hall. It was cool outside now, but the air smelled sweet and clean in contrast to the stale reek of last night's dinner. The sun was rising beyond the foggy haze, casting faint highlights across the landscape. The ground underfoot crunched softly as she walked through crisp, dry grasses. Nora breathed deep and savored the fragrant wind.

She'd been out in this world before. Back on Earth. But only once. Her life hadn't turned out the way it was supposed to, so her parents moved her back home after high school. Then, when she came of age, they set her up with a job and some money to get started. It was the start of something good for her, but... well, that didn't matter anymore.

Ahead lay the main entrance, and Nora slowed to peer in through the glass doors that were bolted shut at all times. From inside, an automated voice spoke over the intercom, announcing the time and informing colonists of the day's schedule.

Nora frowned as she listened to it. This was a new schedule, and she needed to check and make sure it matched what Eve said the Company wanted.",83.0,5.0,48.0,No TF Sampling
43,0.8,1.0,"The walkway to the dormitories was lit by a single overhead bulb casting dim, harsh yellow illumination over the concrete. As she passed under it, Nora's eyes adjusted to the darkness. The dormitory buildings were dark, empty places now. After their morning shifts ended, colonists went home.

As she turned at the end of one long corridor, her footsteps echoing off the cold wall beside her, Nora looked up at the looming shadows cast by the towering cliff face. There was nothing else here but rock, metal, and dust.

The wind blew along her path, rippling her coat and rustling her hair. At the far end of the dormitory building, Nora heard the faint murmur of voices in the rec room.

She quickened her pace, walking faster and more confidently than she had since arriving on the planet. She held herself upright and confident, ready for anything. Her pulse raced with excitement and anticipation. Nora knew she was in the best shape possible.

Nora stopped as she reached the door to the communal showers. She leaned close to the opening, peering inside, waiting impatiently. A stream of water poured down from overhead pipes and splashed into a large basin, filling it. Nora waited patiently. It wasn't long before she could hear the hiss of steam rising above the sound of the shower.

As she pulled open the door, Nora glanced around the dim interior of the shower area. Steam swirled up in billowing clouds. A few colonists stood around the edge, looking out across the floor at the other end of the room. Some of them spoke softly to each other, and some just stared at the dark, damp wall opposite them. All were clad only in soiled clothes.

Nora stepped inside.

The heat shocked her skin, forcing her to pull her shirt over her head and peel off the jacket and utility pants. She tossed both items aside with a grimace. Nora winced as she peeled the thin fabric away from her body, exposing her bare torso to the chilly air.

She'd hoped to be able to get in a quick rinse and shower before starting her work shift. But that was impossible now; she'd have to wait until after her shift.",88.0,6.0,42.0,No TF Sampling
44,0.8,1.0,"The main dormitory area was at the end of the hallway from her room. The hall itself was long, but the rooms were narrow and crowded together. Each one had its own small bathroom near the entrance. On either side of the passage was a row of single-occupancy beds separated by privacy screens.

Nora moved through the hall, peering into each door. She reached the last room on the right. With a sigh she entered.

A quick glance around showed Nora a few other colonists sitting up in their bedding or lounging in the corner. No one else seemed to be awake yet. She stepped into the room, closing the door behind her. A faint, warm light came from the dimness of the ceiling fixtures. Nora felt like she was in a dark cave.

She turned back to face the door. She looked around, trying to get accustomed to the shadows and low light.

Nora frowned as her eyes adjusted. The overhead lights were off and no light seeped under the doors from the hall. She hadn't seen this before. Had there been a blackout or power failure? Was it the fault of the equipment? Or had the generator quit working? If so, when would the next supply ship arrive?

Nora's mind drifted back to her nightmares. Those creatures had killed more than one person. She didn't think she could sleep again tonight.

She walked toward the center of the room. There were three bunk beds set in a row. The other two bunks appeared vacant, but Nora sensed someone was nearby. She glanced over at the door to her right. The privacy screen was partially open and revealed only darkness beyond. She crept closer.

""Hello?"" Nora said tentatively. ""Anyone awake?""

There was no answer.

Nora sighed and sat on the edge of her bed, wondering what she should do with herself for the rest of the day. Maybe she'd better go see if anyone needed help.

She wasn't afraid anymore. But that didn't mean she wanted to be noticed by anyone. Not after seeing what happened to the last engineer who got too close.

The door slid open as Nora approached, revealing the same dingy room she'd seen in her dreams. Her breath caught as she gazed around, wondering how many more times this room would greet her eyes today. Then the reality of it crashed down on her again.

It was a filthy, dank space filled with stacked crates and rusted machinery. Nora looked up from her place near the far wall to avoid bumping into anything and shuddered. The pipes overhead dripped water. Steam escaped the vents along the walls in thick clouds. A faint yellow light flickered beneath the grating.

Nora's gaze wandered over the dirty, broken floor where the concrete had cracked underfoot. At least it was clean enough for her to see her own footprints.

The sound of the door sliding closed behind Nora startled her back into alertness. She turned, ready to demand a reason for shutting the door so quickly. Instead she found herself staring at another face, one with sad eyes and thin, pale skin. It belonged to a woman with dark hair gathered in a ponytail at the nape of her neck.

""Morning,"" Nora said. ""Did I wake you?""

The woman looked up with a wince. Her eyes were red and puffy from lack of sleep. When she spoke, her voice was hoarse. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb..."" She trailed off and shook her head. ""You're new. I've never seen anyone as nice as you before.""

Even the faint echo of Nora's boots as she walked echoed off the concrete walls like ghosts. The halls felt more like tunnels than rooms, narrow corridors cut through solid rock by the colonists' ingenuity and determination.

Nora reached the end of her hallway. A small room waited there—the communal kitchen, a place for gathering during the short break between shifts.

The door opened with a creak, spilling a stream of golden sunlight across the dusty floor. Nora squinted at the brightness, turning in slow circles while taking in the room.

""Hey,"" someone called softly as she turned to face the doorway. ""You're up early.""

A tall man stepped into view from around the corner, framed in brilliant yellow light. He wore the same type of clothing Nora did, though his jacket was black and fitted tight around the chest. His dark hair hung over one eye in a disheveled mop.

Nora recognized him, but he seemed so distant. So far away from her that it made no sense to say anything. She didn't even know what she wanted to say. Her gaze shifted down to the pistol holstered on his hip, then back up again.

""I don't think you should be wearing that outside your quarters, Nora,"" said the man.

Nora blinked in surprise and stepped forward. The man was smiling, but there was a hardness about him now, a coldness she hadn't seen before.

He's afraid...

She felt an odd twinge of fear herself when she realized this, like the world had suddenly become smaller, harder.

""Are you trying to give me a heart attack?"" Nora asked dryly, staring at the gun. She glanced past the stranger, looking around the kitchen. The room seemed so bright, the sun shining directly through the window.

The man shrugged. ""Do I look like a nutjob? You're the one who called my name.""

Nora bit her lip and nodded. ""Yeah, sorry. I just got up. What's going on out there?""

47,0.8,1.0,"The morning chill was still cold from the night air, but a rising sun cast its warming rays across the land. The colony was surrounded by a few scraggly trees in scattered groves, their branches reaching high above to scrape against the stars. The air smelled like pine needles, not yet ripe enough to scent the dew on the ground.

Nora's boots crunched on the gravel of the main concourse. She walked down the middle of the open area, her footsteps echoing off the walls. On either side of the wide corridor were the other two wings of the colony; the dormitories stretched out to her right and the laboratories and power plant to her left.

The laboratories were at the end of the main concourse, separated from the rest of the colony by a thick layer of wall and windows. A security station stood at each end of the corridor that served as a checkpoint. But Nora wasn't worried about getting caught. Her access card allowed her through the checkpoints without trouble.

The doors to the labs were open when Nora arrived, so she let herself in and started to walk down the hallways inside. She glanced at her wristwatch. Her shift wouldn't start for another hour. She could get an early breakfast if she hurried.

Her boots made the familiar metallic thud of every step on the hard flooring. The corridor was dim with a soft glow lighting the way, casting long shadows from the overhead lights. It looked like a deserted town. Nora shivered. She couldn't imagine how anyone lived down here.

Nora followed the hallway down the stairs to the ground level. The large metal door marked the entrance to the power plant. Nora pushed it open and stepped into its light. The room was expansive, filled with towering, heavy machinery. Nora walked over to the nearest machine and peered at it.

It was a fusion reactor, but a much smaller one than the ones used in space stations. This device didn't produce the amount of energy necessary to run the colony. Instead, it provided a small fraction of the power needed to keep everything running.",87.0,6.0,45.0,No TF Sampling

Nora headed out of the dormitory toward the dining hall. After what she'd gone through yesterday, she hadn't expected to get much sleep last night.

But the colony had been up all night, trying to fix the power problem. She hoped they didn't get any more sleep today.

She passed other colonists heading the same way. Most of them nodded at her or spoke briefly. Nora returned the greetings with a casual wave as she hurried past. She couldn't waste time chatting when her first job was fixing one of the power plants.

The sun rose higher in the sky, chasing away lingering fog from the previous day. By midmorning, the temperature began to rise, and the humidity increased to make clothes stick to skin. But Nora's hair dried quickly in the warm breeze.

At lunchtime, the din of people talking, eating, and arguing filled the corridors. She followed a trail of food wrappers to the mess hall. A few familiar faces sat around the tables, including several of the younger engineers who had worked on the power plant.

""Hey,"" someone called as Nora entered. ""There you are.""

A tall man with dark black hair stood up and waved to her. Nora smiled in recognition. The man's name was Joe O'Grady, the Chief Engineer for the power plant. Nora knew him because she'd been his assistant back when she was a kid. He didn't wear his engineering hat anymore, but she could see it on the shelf behind him.

O'Grady led Nora over to the table. ""I thought I recognized your voice!"" he said.

Nora shook hands with her former mentor. ""How have things been going?""

""Oh, great. We're getting close to fixing the power problem. No more night shifts. And they say we might get another ship in next week or two.""

Nora frowned. ""I guess this is what you call 'good news.' There's always something wrong. Maybe a month from now there won't be any power at all.""

Nora stopped at the end of her hall, opened one of the many doors, and stepped out onto a narrow ramp. It led up to the next level. The other residents had already left for work, leaving Nora to trudge through the cold air alone.

The colony's corridors were set apart from each other by several floors in height. The upper levels didn't have windows, but were still bright and filled with activity. They contained labs, manufacturing facilities, and power plants. These uppermost levels also held apartments where the colonists lived in privacy and comfort while on duty.

At ground level, Nora walked along a short corridor lined with storage lockers. She passed a few empty rooms until she reached the garage area, then turned right and entered another small hallway that ended at a large door marked ""Bathroom."" The room inside was cramped and utilitarian, but better than most of the rooms in the colony. The floor was metal grating, not carpet. The walls were covered with a metallic mesh.

In each room, someone was awake and moving about—though not too early for Nora's tastes—and the faint sounds of clattering utensils and muttering voices came from within. The clatter of pots and pans echoed up the corridor at intervals while Nora passed.

At the far end, where most corridors ended, she reached a large glassed-in control center with multiple work stations set around it. A long table took up one side with several chairs. A bank of thick monitors lined the wall on either side, displaying images of the terrain outside. At the head of the table sat a woman in a black leather jacket and trousers.

She wore an unadorned white button-up shirt and red suspenders over her utilitarian pants. She had dark brown hair cropped short on top and a sharp angular face with thin, straight eyebrows meeting above a piercing, intelligent green eye.

Nora smiled when the woman turned to look at her.""Good morning, Rana,""she said as she walked toward her. Rana grinned back and gestured to the empty seats.

They exchanged greetings in the same language Nora's grandparents used, which was their native tongue. It was one of many languages spoken on this colony. The Company wanted to make sure they could communicate with any potential future colonists. But Nora preferred the English she learned from Earth, so she spoke it only in private.

The two women took a seat and chatted for a moment before Rana returned to the front of the room. Her voice was deep and melodious, like a soothing song. The words were accented, though. She had been born on another planet.""We have reports of malfunctioning systems throughout the camp, but it looks like the main computer is still working fine,""Rana said. She ran a hand along her neck and down over her shoulders.""And your shift is off today, Nora. I hope you've had some time to rest.""""Yes, thanks to you,""Nora replied with a smile.",75.0,7.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
51,0.85,1.0,"As she emerged, two men were just setting up breakfast. The kitchen lights turned their faces ruddy in the early morning gloom, and Nora recognized both of them from the work shifts she'd seen. She gave a small wave as she walked by.

The two men responded in kind, but they were distracted; one of them had a clipboard propped on the counter, and the other was talking to Sully. Nora knew he was the colony's primary administrator because she could hear him clearly over the hum of the equipment.

She paused at the doorway to listen.

""... not see why I have to take over this engineering department,"" a man said. ""I'm good enough to run my own crew.""

Sully chuckled. ""Well, you are good enough. Just don't let your ego get in the way of the job. You're here for management experience, remember?""

""Oh, sure. And I know everything there is about the systems, but nobody tells me what those damn machines actually do. They only tell me what they can do—not how!""

A woman joined them. She was a dark-skinned Latina with short black hair and large brown eyes. Her voice was gentle and warm, and she smiled at Sully. ""Carmichael? Is this where we find the chief engineer?""

Nora blinked in surprise, having completely forgotten about her. A grin spread across her face as recognition dawned. ""Hola! Señorita Rodriguez. You work down in the plant?""

The young woman nodded. ""Yes, I'm a mechanic. My name's Maria Rodriguez.""

""We were just catching up,"" Carmichael said. He waved to Nora and grinned again. ""I'm glad you got off early, Nora. How about some breakfast with us? We'll have fresh rolls and coffee ready in five minutes if you're hungry.""

""Sounds great,"" she said. She glanced over her shoulder at the two men. One of them looked at her, his lips twitching upward into a smile.

""And don't worry about anything,"" Sully added. ""We'll keep you safe while you're working.",75.0,4.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
52,0.85,1.0,"She felt better when she put on shoes, but still wanted to be prepared if a repair job needed boots. The walk to the dining hall wasn't long, so she made good time.

At the end of the hallway, she found the community's main food supply in the form of a large central building. Past this was a small courtyard that offered access to the kitchen, greenhouses, power plant, garage, and dormitories. In the distance, through a gap in a nearby cliff face, Nora caught sight of the sun rising above the mountains.

Nora smiled as she stepped into the communal dining room. She'd gotten used to seeing her companions there, even though she didn't eat regularly. The other colonists had been surprised at first, then quickly embraced their new engineer. They laughed at Nora's jokes and helped her with mechanical repairs. Some were friendly in a brotherly way, others reserved for business reasons. But they welcomed her, even if she was the only woman on the planet.

A quick glance around the busy dining hall showed that most colonists would be sitting down to breakfast soon. As she passed the buffet line, Nora glanced at the wide selection of foods lined up on a cart near the entrance. Eggs, pancakes, fried potatoes, bacon, sausage, cereal, and more. She sighed in satisfaction, taking out a plate from one of the counters where a couple of workers polished silverware as she headed to the line.

In addition to being the best-engineer in the colony, Nora also happened to be very skilled at making friends. That was probably why the Company assigned her to this project. The colonists liked working with her. It helped that she made people feel safe and comfortable.

Her efforts paid off here, as did the fact that Nora could always rely on another's help when she needed it. People were always happy to lend a hand, and Nora knew how to get it back if she repaid them in kind.",68.0,7.0,47.0,No TF Sampling
53,0.85,1.0,"The colony's halls were dimly lit in red emergency lights. The air smelled stale from disuse. At least the colonists had learned to use the communal showers, she reminded herself.

As she walked the length of the hallways, she came upon a handful of people heading in different directions. Everyone carried a tool pouch or satchel over their shoulders. These colonists weren't quite up yet, but there wasn't time to wait around for them.

Nora moved at the front of the crowd, her boots scuffing slightly on the synthetic carpeting. The hallways were narrow, so when the colonists crowded too close together they became one file. As a result, Nora had to duck under arms and limbs as she squeezed past them. It seemed an endless crawl.

The walk took longer than she expected due to her own inattentiveness, but soon the sounds of other people talking and the smell of food drifted through the corridors. After a few more turns, she reached another set of doors that opened into the cafeteria.

This section of the colony was fully equipped with a dining hall and kitchen for catering large gatherings. The room buzzed with talk, laughter, and clanging pots. A group of men gathered outside the stove while three women clustered around it in heated discussion. In between, a young man sat slumped in his chair, head on his chest, snoring quietly.

Nora turned right and followed the line of colonists out into the hall again. She walked past the wide central concourse, which ran across the length and breadth of the colony. As she rounded the corner, she passed an open doorway where a woman leaned against one wall. Nora slowed her steps as she approached.

The woman's dark hair and black eyes were just like Nora's, but there was something about the way she held herself, arms folded and leaning back against the doorframe, that made her stand out in the crowd. The woman watched Nora from the corner of her eye with an intent stare.

Nora paused when she drew near enough to see the woman more clearly. The woman wore a plain grey jumpsuit that bore the name tag'Rosa'. Her shoulders hunched, and her head cocked slightly at an awkward angle. There was no telling how long this woman had been standing in place, staring into space. A few other colonists were passing in the opposite direction, but they didn't notice Rosa.",80.0,7.0,47.0,No TF Sampling
54,0.85,1.0,"Downstairs, she found Sully already at the table in the communal kitchen eating what looked like a slice of toast with jam and orange juice poured over it.

""What are you doing up?"" Sully asked, blinking bleary eyes. He set his toast aside, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and pointed to his stomach. ""I'm still hungry.""

Nora grimaced. She hated mornings. The whole routine was suffocatingly regimented. And the food wasn't bad... but it was also bland, and always the same.

She sat across from him, taking a deep breath. There were things to do. She sighed again as she grabbed her own fork.

This morning's meal was an omelet made with nutrient broth, some type of protein concentrate, egg yolk, and salt—all cooked into the eggs before serving. It was the only thing they got that might be considered edible, so it tasted pretty good most of the time, and today Nora liked how fresh and full her belly felt.

Nora glanced around the crowded room, looking for someone else. She couldn't see anyone.

Sully nodded toward her plate with a faint smile. ""Don't forget your breakfast.""

She blinked and took another bite. She didn't feel very hungry, but the smell of the food had awakened something in her stomach. She chewed slowly and swallowed before nodding agreement.

""Thanks,"" she said around a mouthful of egg and toast, which was actually pretty good.

Sully nodded absently and returned to his own breakfast, while Nora finished hers off and washed up. With a sigh she pulled her hair back into a ponytail. As she tied it with her belt, Nora realized Sully wasn't there anymore.

She looked around and caught sight of him walking down the hall toward the front door. When he reached it, he paused, and turned to look at her over his shoulder. She could barely make out the expression on his face as he lifted one hand in farewell. Nora sighed again, exasperated by her partner's habit of leaving before she woke up.",63.0,5.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
55,0.85,1.0,"The hallways were dim and shadowed, though the floors were well-lit. The walls and ceiling were gray metallic plates bolted together in a complex honeycomb design. On either side of the hallway, small rectangular recessed openings allowed narrow corridors to the right and left of each wall. The spaces were about two meters wide, but only slightly taller than a man. Most were filled with storage lockers and service areas for the colonists' needs.

Nora passed through the open door at the end of her own corridor. She walked out onto the front porch, where she shivered as wind whipped across her face. Fog hovered over the ground like the ghosts of old wars, swirling around the bases of large rocks that protruded from the dirt.

""Morning,"" Nora greeted the colony manager, who was already waiting at the edge of one of these boulders. His name was John Stebbings. ""You're up early.""

""Not so early as you are."" He grinned. ""I got myself a cup of coffee while I waited. Want some?""

Nora smiled back. ""Sure.""

Stebbings handed her his steaming mug. She took it gratefully, inhaling deeply before taking a sip and wrinkling her nose in distaste. ""What is this? I'd swear it's battery acid if not for the sugar.""

He laughed. ""It's a mixture of caffeine and sugar. Keeps me awake. A little bitter, but worth the price. And don't worry. You'll get used to it. That said, we have more than enough for everyone here.""

She grunted. ""I'm not worried about that. More about the lack of food. I'll be lucky if my stomach doesn't revolt on me. Or worse, growl like an angry bear. What's that supposed to mean?""

Stebbings shook his head. ""Never mind. It'll keep. Don't forget your ration card."" He gestured toward a small pouch hanging around Nora's neck.

Nora paused in reaching up to take the card. ""My rations? For breakfast? But I had lunch yesterday.""

""Yeah,"" he said. ""Well... it's not like you're going hungry. We've got plenty of food in the storage units—we just don't want any of it to spoil.""

Her eyes narrowed.",87.0,4.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
56,0.85,1.0,"Nora's legs felt like jelly when she left her room, but by the time she made it to the communal kitchen, she found herself moving with purpose. Her footsteps echoed off walls of hard surfaces in empty corridors, and a sense of cold pervaded the entire colony. But the colony's power plant still ran, so no lights were out.

The dining hall was packed to capacity. There wasn't even enough room for her to squeeze through. Nora picked up a tray and took a seat at one of the long tables. Several colonists passed her food, and they exchanged a nod or a wave. They were all busy with their own tasks. No one noticed her.

Nora ate quickly. By the time she finished, her stomach rumbled loudly enough to draw curious looks. It was true. The colonists were hungry; Nora could smell it in the air.

The hallways had been designed to be self-sufficient, including a vast network of pipes that distributed water and collected wastes. As she returned to her room, Nora noted how clean and well-maintained the infrastructure was. That was unusual, as the Company often overlooked maintenance. Even with a fully automated colony, someone should check on systems and equipment regularly.

She walked past a pair of engineering bays to an unoccupied set of doors. One of the large rooms was empty. Nora entered and closed the door behind her, then took a seat at the console. A thin layer of dust covered its surface. The room was dark. Nora waited for her eyes to adjust. After a few seconds, the display flickered into life, casting an orange glow over rows of switches and controls.

She pressed a control marked with a green circle. With a soft hum and a low whine, a massive power loader lowered itself from overhead and settled onto one of the floor's raised sections. The loader contained sophisticated motors, electronics, and hydraulics. Though they were heavy to move manually, it was simple to operate with a small touch screen. Nora stepped inside, sat down, and tapped the monitor to activate her loaders controls.

The loader began moving across the ground in slow jerky movements as Nora navigated through its menus. She paused when she found a submenu labeled 'load,' which allowed her to specify items and materials she wanted moved around. She searched through available options until she found what she was looking for.",80.0,7.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
57,0.85,1.0,"The colony's main dining hall was open to the airy, windowless space at the heart of the complex. This central chamber was the site of community meetings, lectures, social gatherings, banquets, weddings... and breakfasts. All meals were communal affairs; colonists worked in shifts throughout the day to keep everyone fed. The Colony was divided into three different work schedules, one for each of the eight-hour periods. Breakfast always ran twenty minutes behind schedule because of the constant interruptions.

Nora crossed the corridor, following the noise to the breakfast room, and stood in line for a meal she rarely wanted to eat but felt obliged to take anyway. On her way back to her quarters, she passed through the small training gymnasium. Most of the time, this space was empty. It had served as an exercise area and meeting place when Presley's Promise was still under construction, but since its completion it had been relegated to storage.

Nora turned down the hallway toward her apartment. As usual, a few colonists lingered outside her door, waiting for their turns to use the communal shower. Nora had just stepped into the hall when the familiar sound of boots crunching gravel jerked her attention away from the other residents.

She stopped in place and peered around the corner at the intruder's approach. A tall man strode purposefully toward her with determined steps. He wore the same utilitarian uniform as Nora, and his dark hair was neatly parted on the left side above a broad forehead. His face was lean and clean shaven, though he'd left some stubble along his jawline to make him look more rugged.

He nodded brusquely in greeting. ""Good morning, Engineer Decker.""

""Mornin',"" she replied automatically. Her gaze roved over the stranger's body as she tried to remember who he was. In a flash, she realized. This was Sully Carmichael, the colony administrator and Chief Engineer, the person responsible for keeping everything working properly.

Sully always made her nervous.",92.0,9.0,42.0,No TF Sampling
58,0.85,1.0,"The corridor was empty, as usual. As she approached the cafeteria, Nora heard voices drifting down from a high-ceilinged room just past the hall juncture—the colonists' recreation center.

Nora was surprised when she saw Sully standing outside the doorway, smiling and chatting with a young woman named Tessa. Her dark brown hair hung long over both shoulders like a curtain. She wore a white sleeveless tank top that showed off the curves of her toned arms and biceps. Nora guessed she was somewhere in her mid twenties with a small, neat nose, full lips, and wide eyes.

Sully must be dating now, Nora thought. He was always talking about Tessa, but she never let herself get too invested. It seemed like something he might do, but it wasn't fair to make assumptions about what his life had become. Nora knew firsthand how lonely this place could be, after spending so many months on the ground.

Nora hesitated. She wanted to ask him if she could use the bathroom first, then joined him and Tessa in the cafeteria. But the moment stretched into awkward silence as Nora struggled to find an opening to bring up her concerns.

Tessa glanced at her watch. ""Oh! I've got to run."" The girl smiled reassuringly. ""See you later!"" she said, breezing past Sully and heading down the hallway.

""I'll meet you guys there,"" Sully called after her. As Tessa hurried off, he turned to look for Nora again.

""Hey, Nora,"" he said. ""That's really nice of you to help out with the colony today.""

""It's no problem.""

""You want a ride back?""

Nora hesitated. ""Um, yeah.""

Sully frowned as he scanned the hall. ""It should be pretty easy to catch from here. I'll just head straight home. See you soon, okay?""

Nora nodded and watched him leave before she headed into the restroom to freshen up.",71.0,5.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
59,0.85,1.0,"The corridor outside looked like any other on this side of the colony's main dome. She passed small laboratories, where colonists worked tirelessly at their tasks, and power plants that converted natural gas from pockets around the colony to electric current. The corridors were mostly dark, except for a few dim lamps lighting the way for people hurrying through the colony.

A few meters from the central dome, Nora slowed, catching sight of a familiar shape in the shadows. Her heart jumped as she walked toward it, knowing exactly what she was about to find.

Beside the stairs leading up to the command center sat an ancient power loader.

No one had seen fit to tell Nora that her best friend was dead. Her parents told her he was injured but would recover when they returned home from their mission. Nora found the silence awkward, even after so many days of working beside him. He'd been her first engineer, her only ally in the harsh isolation of Presley's Promise.

Nora's fingers tightened on the railing and paused a few steps short of the old machine. She forced herself to step forward, ignoring the heat that crept through her body and into her face. She stood beside the machine, feeling its rusted metal skin beneath her fingers. It was too hot to touch without discomfort, but the warmth made it seem almost alive.

With a sigh, Nora stepped away and pulled open the door. The air inside the chamber felt cool as she shut the door behind her and walked down the corridor to the garage. Inside, the loader's wide, armored doors were closed. Nora climbed the ladder, stepping through a hatch in the top of the loader. Her feet clanged loudly on the platform as she stopped, staring at the strange device.

It was like nothing she'd ever seen before.

The loader sat inside a cavernous bay. It looked large enough to accommodate several of the colony's ground vehicles. Atop the bay, cables hung from an iron grid, while a long, snaking umbilical extended out one end.

The other end of the loader jutted into the gloom beyond Nora's field of vision. Its curved end terminated in a thick, bulbous tube that swelled into the darkness.",75.0,7.0,41.0,No TF Sampling
60,0.9,1.0,"On the landing outside the dormitory, she felt a sudden change in the air temperature as the breeze died. The atmosphere was noticeably cold, making her toes feel like they were frozen in place. She shivered slightly but fought the impulse to rub warmth back into them. With a deep breath, she started down the hall toward the communal showers.

When the lights flickered off at the end of the hall, Nora instinctively slowed to let other colonists pass her. The dim illumination cast shadows across her path and obscured what might be lurking on either side. It also made the corridor appear dark and sinister.

The faint glimmering from the next set of rooms didn't alleviate that impression. As she approached the flickering glow, Nora's foot caught on a loose floor tile and sent her stumbling forward. She regained balance with the added help of a wall. Without pausing to assess if it was safe, Nora stepped around the corner into the first room.

It wasn't completely dark, so long as she faced away from the light. Light streamed in from a window high up on one wall and a door beside it. She could hear the low hum of an electric current through the ceiling, indicating power lines or equipment running on backup batteries.

A single, bright point of orange light sat atop a metal desk. An oil lamp burned like the sun overhead. Its heat warmed her face.",61.0,7.0,41.0,No TF Sampling
61,0.9,1.0,"At the end of the long hall, she paused in front of a door labeled 'Dining Hall' and opened it slowly to peer inside. The room was nearly empty. A few colonists milled about and ate at round tables near the far wall where a handful of servers passed food around. Her fellow engineers clustered together near one corner where four more workers stood by waiting to serve them.

She entered the dining area. There was just enough time to take a quick cup of coffee before the workday began.

The serving girl's face turned toward her, but when Nora saw her eyes the girl smiled instead. Nora returned the smile tentatively, her heart pounding fast. For a moment, she forgot what she'd come to do.

Nora found a table that wasn't already occupied. She set down her coffee cup and sat, still trying not to stare at the server. She kept seeing the eyes of the dead men lying in a bloody pile back in her quarters.

A server placed food on the tabletop. As Nora reached for it, she realized she didn't know how much the meal cost. It probably cost a lot. But right now her budget was only limited by a few hundred dollars, most of which was already spent on necessities like food and rent.

Nora dug into the breakfast before her. The meal consisted of eggs, fried potatoes, bacon, bread with butter, and warm milk. After eating, she drank the last sips from her coffee cup.

A server approached again. ""You ready to start your shift?"" he asked.

""I am.""",72.0,5.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
62,0.9,1.0,"Down the hall, another engineer stood by the door to the mess hall. His head jerked up at her approach, face reddening in recognition, then he rushed across the room to open it. As she entered, Nora could smell the familiar mix of eggs, bacon, fresh-brewed coffee, and buttery toast wafting through the air. The low hum of conversation fell silent at Nora's entrance. She looked around the tables where colonists sat, eating quietly while they waited for their portions. Some stared at her as she walked down the center aisle between them, others watched her curiously from the edges of the crowd.

The sound of plates banging together as people moved through the line caught her attention, and Nora turned to see a young man filling his plate. He was dressed like many of the colonists—a pair of jeans and a plaid button-up shirt under a long coat. But his outfit looked better cared for than most. Nora studied him as he placed the plate on top of one that already held food and handed it off to someone behind him.

He glanced over his shoulder, noticing Nora as she approached. She paused in front of him with her back to him, not sure what to do next. This was the first time she had seen another person since arriving here. Her face remained blank, but she couldn't stop herself from glancing down at the plate.

With practiced motions, Nora took a forkful of the scrambled eggs she loved so much. She popped it in her mouth, chewing vigorously as she stared at the man. His features were sharp and attractive enough. The angular bones of his nose gave his forehead an unusual prominence.",85.0,7.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
63,0.9,1.0,"She descended a winding stairwell that connected the dormitory to the central engineering area below. Here, she found a small dining hall with three long tables occupied by colonists eating food. Many of them were men; they sat close together in a clique while women ate alone at the far end. In contrast to the well-worn uniforms worn for every other task, these people wore crisp and neat lab coats that looked brand new.

As Nora passed through the dining area, the diners paused from their meals to stare at her. A few stared openly, but most seemed confused and uncertain of why she was there.

For a moment she considered going back up to her room to grab some breakfast, but the idea of lingering near the table filled her with an urgent need for nourishment that drove her forward.

The kitchen, where Nora first encountered the alien drones, felt cramped despite the cavernous dimensions compared to what she expected. The wide doors opened to an enclosed chamber that held rows of work stations and storage racks alongside a large cooking hearth. But it wasn't just the size that surprised her.

It was how busy everything in here seemed to be. Food processors chugged, conveyors hummed, and robotic arms handled dozens of tasks at once. A crew of four people worked efficiently in the midst of the chaos, their faces grim and their expressions tired.

Nora stepped past a conveyor belt and into the crowded space. As she pushed through the swarm of workers, Nora made eye contact with two of them. They didn't return her gaze; they stared at her with glazed, vacant eyes. Nora's breath caught as she noticed something new.",85.0,7.0,45.0,No TF Sampling
64,0.9,1.0,"A few other colonists were awake at this early hour too, making for a long line at the communal bathroom. Nora glanced around as she passed them, but no one seemed to notice her. Her new friend had said they didn't talk much when they met, which explained the cold glances everyone gave her.

She couldn't blame them. Not after the last six months of working for these people without pay, eating their food, and having nothing to do with anyone. At first, Nora tried to fit in like everybody else, doing what needed to be done until someone got tired of her. But then the Company started giving her work that required a little more thinking and planning. And that meant learning how to interact with people, something that was difficult for an engineer who preferred machines.

The colony's cafeteria looked even emptier than usual this morning. Nora sat down at the end of the empty table and picked up a plate, wondering if there was anything left from yesterday's meal. A warm, soft voice sounded behind her.""You're back,""said Sully, sliding onto his chair beside her. He smiled.""I can tell.""""Hi,""she replied sheepishly as she dug into the porridge piled high on her plate. It smelled fresh, so it must have been made just that morning. Nora sighed and sipped her watery coffee, letting the bitter brew soothe her throat.

Sully watched her eat before speaking again.""How are you feeling today? I saw you went right to sleep after dinner.""Nora stopped midchew. The way he'd phrased that question made her feel... vulnerable. She swallowed, trying not to think too hard about why that might make her uncomfortable.",65.0,6.0,46.0,No TF Sampling
65,0.9,1.0,"The halls were filled with colonists heading for the communal dining hall. Most wore coveralls like Nora, though few seemed to be wearing the latest fashion trends. Nora liked the old fashioned way people dressed out here. The uniforms let her know she was in a colony full of friends and neighbors.

When Nora entered the dining room, people sat at tables eating cereal while others chatted around a long table. They smiled greetings as Nora passed them. Everyone knew everyone else here; they'd come together when the Company brought the settlement to life and worked hard and cooperatively to get everything working as smoothly as possible.

The communal kitchen was set up on one side of the hall, so Nora could grab whatever food needed for break time quickly if she wasn't going to make it back in time. Some colonists joked about that; since most equipment couldn't take any power draw at all, this was something of an advantage. But most engineers preferred to be efficient rather than convenient.

Nora headed toward the kitchen, passing a wide array of open cupboards with neatly labeled containers inside. She scanned the labels. As much as she wanted to indulge in fresh fruits and pastries, her hunger won out over laziness and she took a jar of jam from the shelf. Jam was almost universally appreciated by people in this region because it kept well even without refrigeration, and despite the scarcity of other supplies the colonists weren't stingy with their fruit preserves.

While the kitchen might have been large enough to feed a small city, it looked no bigger than her average apartment back home. Nora grabbed a knife and a bowl for peeling fruit before heading through the door into the rest of the communal area.

A few paces down the hall were two large, glass-walled recreation rooms that had been converted into lounges to accommodate more colonists in smaller groups.

The colony's dining hall wasn't much to look at, but it was big enough. More than a hundred people could crowd inside. The ceiling high above arched over the room and supported a grid of pipes that ran the length of the place. Each pipe spanned the width of three men, lined up like soldiers. In the center of the room stood a row of servers set to one side. These servers were connected to other stations at each end of the hall. One of these terminals rested on Nora's right shoulder, while another sat atop her head on the left.

Nora leaned in close to peer up through the glass countertop. Below, rows of dark green boxes waited for orders. A wide, thin window divided the front from the back. The windows were fitted with thick rubber seals and smoked heavily when they rippled in the breeze.

She looked down at the terminal on her shoulder. It read: ""Dormitory 1, Nora Decker.""

Below the words, an arrow pointed up the corridor, toward the dormitories. To the right of this, a tiny menu bar displayed a few options. The only word visible was ""Breakfast"".

They would be heading to their shifts at the power plant, engineering bay, mess hall, medical clinic, cafeteria, and a dozen other locations scattered around the complex.

Nora's footsteps echoed loudly in the vast space. She saw a few groups of workers hurrying towards the mess halls, though many more loitered aimlessly like Nora. Some sat alone on their beds. Others slept. Most simply watched the bleak landscape from within the narrow confines of their bunks, staring vacantly at nothing.

Nora turned back to her quarters, taking slow steps as she headed for the common showers and bathrooms down each hallway. A wave of exhaustion swept over her. She felt it coming on as she took in the stark scene outside her window, thinking of her warm bed and hot shower ahead of her.

She stopped dead in her tracks and spun about. In one swift motion, Nora unsnapped her utility belt, kicked off her shoes, and swung herself through the nearest air vent.

Her mind screamed to turn and run, but adrenaline pushed aside every logical impulse. Now or never, thought Nora as she plunged through cold darkness into the maze of pipes. As she squeezed past a narrow gap, Nora felt something touch her leg just above her knee and gave a sharp yelp as pain shot up her spine.

But it wasn't a predator that had touched her; the sensation was from the loose electrical wiring dangling beneath the ceiling. She twisted around awkwardly, still clinging to the metal conduit. There wasn't enough room in the cramped passage for her to squeeze out again and there were no more gaps between pipes to swing by.",80.0,7.0,39.0,No TF Sampling

This morning, the only people awake at this early hour were the few night-shift workers on the engineering teams who didn't yet know what they'd be working on.

Nora walked the narrow walkway between rows of double doors leading to the various bays. The corridors echoed with low voices coming from behind closed doors as she passed.

A large door in the hallway stood ajar, revealing an open space full of tall, bulky equipment and tools. A man in a white uniform watched her pass, nodding politely.

The main hangar bay was also deserted, lit by harsh lights that cast shadows everywhere. Nora glanced around to make sure no one else was nearby, then slipped outside. She stepped cautiously around a corner into another corridor and took off down it with purposeful steps toward the power plant. She arrived just as the day shift began walking in with clipboards in hand, each of them wearing a red company vest over their coveralls. Nora waved to the group, but kept going toward her workplace.

""Hey,"" one said, ""Are you heading back after your break?""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah.""

""I'm gonna grab breakfast first—can I walk with you?""

Nora hesitated, but then shrugged. ""Sure.""

""What are you up to this morning?"" a second asked when the first one paused beside Nora.

""Going out for a bite, I think.""

""Huh,"" the second responded.

Nora followed the line of the corridor until she saw her destination ahead; a large metal door set into the base of a cliff wall. It was marked with the Company logo and painted black. Nora studied it for a moment, trying to remember if the doors were usually locked or unlocked.

The two engineers came abreast of her again.",80.0,6.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
69,0.9,1.0,"At first glance the colony appeared like any other small industrial complex: utilitarian structures lining straight paths between rocky hills, each one housing the families who called them home. But where others saw smooth walls and flat floors, Nora caught glimpses of ragged gaps in the flooring. She'd seen the same thing when she visited her mother's family on Earth, where the foundations had always been crumbling. This was only to be expected in a frontier colony built on shifting sands, but it didn't make the view less disquieting.

But Nora wasn't thinking about the foundation of the colony. The reality of her situation lay deeper than that. And she wouldn't let herself look beyond the here and now, because if she stopped looking there was no place to go.

She headed for the mess hall. At least food tasted better in this environment. Maybe it was the dust or grit in their mouths from working outside, but most colonists preferred not to risk choking on sand as they ate. So despite the gritty flavor of the unidentifiable stew sloshing in its bowls, Nora found herself savoring the taste and texture on her tongue.

After washing her face at a sink beside the showers, she passed through the greenhouses on her way to the command center to begin her shift. As she walked she watched her feet squish underfoot and marveled again at the strange, rugged land beneath them.",82.0,9.0,45.0,No TF Sampling
70,0.95,1.0,"The hallways were dark under the heavy layer of dust. She reached for the overhead lights but missed, bumping into someone else in the process. ""Oh! Excuse me!""

""Not like you're not always knocking your head against something,"" said a familiar voice. The speaker was Sully Carmichael, the colony's main administrator. He nodded back at her as he straightened up from where she'd banged into him.

Nora smiled. ""You know it.""

He flashed that bright white smile of his. Nora had known Sully for years; they were friends but also working partners. And she respected the man. She liked his easy manner, his willingness to engage, even as it kept him distant.

Sully gestured with one hand toward their shared bathroom. ""Shall we?""

Nora checked herself in the mirror. Her hair was still tangled and her face red from sleep. She gave the tousled mess a shake and fluffed out her hair, then pulled on a fresh pair of boots over sweatpants that matched the utilitarian color scheme of the rest of her clothing. After a final glance into the mirror, Nora took the lead, reaching for the doorknob beside the large door set in front of them. ""Mmhm.""

The doors parted on an empty corridor beyond the room. On a planet this far from any other human community, it made sense to keep rooms physically separated. One could stay warm without disturbing the others. And if one was sleeping alone, there would be no unwanted contact.

Still, despite the advantages of this arrangement, Nora preferred having people around when she slept. It helped remind her that they were all she had left after losing everyone else. If the Company didn't return soon, Nora might be alone forever. The thought sent goose bumps rising along her arms.

Nora paused for a moment and looked up at Sully, who stood just inside the opening. His smile vanished with his next words. ""Do I have to tell you again?""",81.0,5.0,42.0,No TF Sampling
71,0.95,1.0,"The colony had only recently been built. Its infrastructure was already a patchwork mess of cables, conduits, and plastic tubing strewn around every surface, mostly obscured by a thick layer of dust. Nora strode briskly toward the communal dining hall, careful to keep an eye open for debris. The air smelled stale with grease and machine oil.

She slipped inside through a side door. Nora stopped just beyond the doorway to let her eyes adjust to the gloom, which revealed rows of empty tables to either side of a large serving line. In front of the line sat two automated food dispensers and several young people waiting on them.

An artificial intelligence controlled everything at Presley's Promise except the colonists themselves. Eve is always polite, even when she has something unpleasant to tell you. Nora imagined that being polite could be difficult under stress, but it was likely preferable to telling you ""no"" instead of whatever nasty answer Eve might have given.

Eve made sure each meal came in a container with its own water source so the colonists didn't go thirsty. That also meant meals took longer than they otherwise would, which Nora found inconvenient since she preferred a hot breakfast as soon as possible after rising for the day.

When Nora got closer to the serving line, she caught sight of her own name floating above one of the plates on a long table. She smiled and began walking toward it, then stopped short. A figure was sprawled across her plate, right where Nora had set down her utensils to dig into some bread rolls smothered in gravy.

The dead body wasn't fresh. It smelled like sour rot and moldy earth, not of chemicals or decomposition, but a far more primal scent. Nora's hand curled into a fist. ""Eve.""

Eve responded, without any expression whatsoever, ""Yes, Nora Decker?""

Nora jerked her attention from the corpse back to the AI. Its blank face did nothing to calm her rising anxiety. She clenched her jaw until her teeth ached. ""What happened?""

""A drone entered your colony in search of food,"" Eve answered. ""It encountered a large quantity of human blood spilled on a hydroponic row.",67.0,8.0,40.0,No TF Sampling
72,0.95,1.0,"The morning hours passed slowly as she worked to fix every mechanical failure she could identify and make temporary repairs where possible. At nightfall, when it came time for a brief evening meal, Nora sat at the small table in the communal dining area and ate alone while other colonists slept. The only sound, but one of many, was rustling from a nearby group across the room.

Nora's thoughts turned toward home, and to the person who waited there for her. Her boyfriend, Willy, was waiting back on Earth for her return. He always sent her postcards when he knew she had arrived safely. His face flashed through her mind, filling her with homesickness.

""Willie,"" Nora muttered under her breath as tears burned behind her eyes. ""I miss you so much!""

The tears stung in spite of herself, though they were not unexpected and Nora would have cried regardless.

73,0.95,1.0,"The dormitory hallways were cramped but cozy—a short distance from the showers but also closer to the mess hall for early breakfasts. She took a long, slow breath of recycled air as she walked. The halls of the colony were kept at low pressure to conserve oxygen. Her breath frosted in front of her face. She squinted as her vision misted.

She reached the dining room without freezing. Nora walked through its entrance, blinking away the fog as she entered. All around her, rows of tables filled with colonists worked their way down one wall toward the cafeteria counter. They sat along both sides, looking expectant. This was the busiest time of day for the colonists who had been up all night fixing equipment or making repairs.

Nora approached the line. Three empty seats awaited her beside a woman wearing a heavy work outfit. The two people behind her moved aside as Nora climbed the steps to join them.""Good morning, Nora,""the woman greeted her in English with a faint accent. She seemed kind, but like most other workers, Nora didn't know if she could trust this stranger's motives. She offered a smile.

The woman returned it.""I'm Giselle.""Giselle gestured to Nora's plate, which still bore half of an unfinished meal from last night. She said,""I'll have yours for you.""Nora looked down at her plate in surprise. Before she realized it, she had picked up the fork and started to fill it.""Thanks,""she muttered as she raised the utensil to her mouth.

She chewed and swallowed quickly while Giselle continued her pleasantries about the colony. There were so many layers to be peeled away between each of them. Nora wondered how anyone got along here. She felt a flash of frustration. What did they do besides work and sleep?

But that was not why she'd come out to breakfast, despite her hunger.

Nora tried to catch the server eye to ask for another slice of toast as she ate. She failed, but instead, she reached around Giselle to get closer to her fellow colonists. Her hand brushed the arm of the man on the other side of her.",78.0,6.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
74,0.95,1.0,"After checking the colony's power grid, Nora headed toward the cafeteria in the main hall.

""Good morning, Sully,"" she said as she entered the cavernous room.

""Mornin'."" Sully turned from a small table where he ate breakfast. He wore a stained gray uniform and had his hair buzzed close to the scalp.

""Don't you mean, 'good afternoon'?"" Nora asked with exaggerated politeness. ""The sun's already down.""

""Can't help it, sweetheart,"" the older man replied with an innocent smile and a gesture at her bed.

Nora grimaced. ""Oh, right. That's why you can't get up earlier."" She paused before adding, ""Morning for me is... early. Just give me fifteen minutes to shower off this stinking grease.""

Sully nodded in response as Nora made her way to the cafeteria line.

The food didn't make much sense—some kind of breakfast stew and a hard roll—but Nora kept shoveling it down with her hands. When she finally got to her destination, the empty seat beside Sully was taken. Nora glared at the man sitting across from him. She'd never gotten to eat before work, but even if there was room she wouldn't share Sully's spot.

Her stomach rumbled as she approached and sat down. A wave of guilt washed through Nora when she saw how quickly Sully consumed his breakfast, despite a full plate. She wanted to apologize for the mess on the floor—they'd be working together today, so cleanliness wasn't just good manners, it made a difference between getting ahead or losing someone's job.

""Good morning,"" the man said. He had dark hair and eyes, an accent unlike anything Nora had heard before, and a smile that turned up only one corner of his mouth.

""My name's Sammi. It's nice to meet you.""

Nora raised an eyebrow. ""Nice? Who are you?""

Sammy chuckled.",75.0,6.0,41.0,No TF Sampling
75,0.95,1.0,"She passed through a doorway that led to the colony's communal bathrooms where other colonists were already awake and working their way through a morning routine. Some had just finished their showers while others prepared for theirs. As she passed, the sounds of the communal bathroom faded behind her as it became apparent how many people worked there.

Nora entered the corridor outside the bathroom, noticing as she did so that a small cluster of people clustered around a portable screen. The group gathered around one technician seated at his station. She recognized him, but she couldn't recall his name. He wasn't new; he'd been there for years now.

He watched Nora pass by with a smile, his eyes catching hers with the barest hint of curiosity in them. That tiny glimpse told her something about him: that he was intelligent enough to know Nora would have no interest in him, nor in any man in particular. Perhaps even that she found the idea of romance laughable. She might have considered herself too young and inexperienced to consider marriage, especially considering her age, but she thought the same of most everyone else. If you took the average human being and shook up all their emotional baggage for a few months, they would be a much happier person.

But she knew it was all an act. Nora kept up the façade because it made people like Sully, her boss and friend, feel better, and it helped to keep her job.

She glanced again at the man as she passed by and he waved back.

""Morning,"" she said when she was close enough to see what he looked like in detail. His dark hair framed a sharp-chinned face with eyes of deep gray that gave his appearance a hard edge; she imagined the lines on his face were etched by experience. ""You looking forward to another day?""

He nodded. ""A little change in pace will do me some good.""

Nora nodded slowly. It was nice to know someone liked their work. She didn't make it her business to pry into other people's lives or get involved, but she could always use more friends.",78.0,7.0,48.0,No TF Sampling
76,0.95,1.0,"Warm sunlight filtered into a dimly lit hallway from slatted windows at regular intervals around the outer wall. The window frames were so badly rusted she could use the tips of her fingers to push them shut. She rubbed grit out from beneath each frame, trying to scrape the rust off before it ate its way through to the glass.

After several minutes of laborious work she leaned back in frustration. The frames refused to budge despite the intense heat. At last Nora heaved a sigh and slid the window open with a shuddering creak. A blast of cool morning air flooded the hallway, bringing new life to the dust and ash stinging Nora's eyes.

A quick look around confirmed her hunch about where breakfast was going to be. With more than usual caution she peered over the ledge of her dormitory window to survey the grounds below. Her breath caught for a moment in surprise.

A sleek vehicle was parked nearby, right next to the communal shower stalls. Its engine idled smoothly with nothing else moving within sight or sound. Nora blinked and squinted before taking a couple of steps forward, trying to make sure the machine really was there, because it looked so damned big. It would have been almost invisible from outside had not the dust thrown up by the recent storm clouded the air for miles around.

The heavy-duty power loader sat quietly with its tailgate fully down. Thick wheels rested on blackened tires that held them securely to the ground, like they belonged here. The vehicle resembled a huge mechanical beetle squatting silently atop the hardpan in front of her window.

Nora let out another soft gasp, but no one seemed to notice, although she knew their keen eyes were watching her from the other side of the campus. She took another step toward the vehicle and it creaked ominously under her weight.",64.0,8.0,43.0,No TF Sampling
77,0.95,1.0,"Most colonists lived in dormitories filled with rows of simple single rooms along hallways lined with closed doors. In the halls, laundry lines strung from ceiling to floor. Many of these lines sported clothing dangling like vines from them and wisps of smoke wafting up from their open ends, where clothes were being ironed. Others hung askew, limp and dusty. At the end of each hallway were communal showers, but no access to private bathrooms. Toiletries needed to be shared by everyone, so most colonists left themselves filthy while they were busy working.

In the mornings, the halls bustled with activity; people went about their jobs, dressed in old work wear and stained overalls. The colony's technicians were just one such group, although unlike most of the others here, Nora wasn't a technician. Her job title was Senior Engineer.

As an engineer in charge of testing the machinery throughout Presley's Promise, Nora often spent long hours fixing broken equipment and cleaning dust out of pipes. Most of her time was taken by paperwork, and she occasionally had to give verbal updates to company representatives in New York or wherever else the Company kept its colonies. But every once in a while, Nora got to test new things. And when something broke—especially something like the power plant that supplied everything she saw and used everyday—she could take it apart and fix it herself, rather than waiting for help from some other person. It made for a more interesting day, since she liked to tinker with the machines. She especially enjoyed when the parts broke down in interesting ways.

With all this downtime, Nora never seemed tired despite her grueling schedule. When not working on repairs, she played video games, read books, and practiced dance moves in her room after work at night. These weren't really hobbies per se, but simply Nora's favorite activities to do with the downtime she inevitably gained. So far, her schedule hadn't gotten too hectic and so Nora hadn't run into any serious problems yet, and there'd been no accidents either.",73.0,9.0,44.0,No TF Sampling
78,0.95,1.0,"It was chilly in the morning air, but Nora barely noticed. The sun hadn't risen yet, although a thin crescent moon bathed the land in silvery light. Coldness did little to slow her walk down the dark corridor toward the cafeteria.

The sound of footsteps clanging across the hall stopped Nora in her tracks. As she turned back towards the source, the young engineer heard a woman's voice, too muffled to identify, say something short and curt, then there was silence. Nora frowned. No one spoke to her that way. She wasn't sure what bothered her more: the way someone had spoken to her like that, or her reaction to it.

In any case, Nora didn't linger on her decision; she hurried down the long metal corridor until she reached the door at the end where the female voice had come from. Inhaling deeply, Nora gripped the handle firmly as she stepped inside the darkened cafeteria.

There was no one in sight. A couple of tables sat empty and unoccupied along the wall. She paused just outside the doorway, glancing around the room as her eyes adjusted. The only person she could see besides herself was a single figure standing near an open service panel beside one of the walls.

Nora moved forward cautiously, trying not to make any sudden sounds. Even if this intruder were human, she'd been attacked before and it paid to be cautious in these situations. Her steps faltered and caught when she saw what the other figure held.

It was a pair of dark lenses mounted on brass frames. She recognized them instantly—the black glass of one eye had shattered. Nora's mouth opened wordlessly as the other half fell out. The glass eye had rolled to stop at Nora's feet, while its counterpart stared straight up into her face like a blind creature on stilts.

She screamed. Then she fumbled for the gun strapped across her torso. ""Get away!"" she cried hoarsely, pressing both hands against the butt of her weapon.

Somehow, Sully managed to sleep past the alarm. He'd been roused long enough for Nora to fill him in on what had happened while he was snoozing off shift. Now that morning was over, the two of them walked together toward the mess hall. The hall itself was dim and quiet, although outside the morning chill still lingered despite the rising sun's warmth.

As they approached, Nora spotted a single figure sitting at one of the table corners, facing inward away from everyone else. She gave him a nod as he sat back in his chair, leaving enough distance between them so the low table didn't block her view.

""Hey, Sam,"" Nora said softly.

The man swiveled around in his chair to face her, glancing up briefly and then returning his attention forward again. He looked young, but the dark circles under his eyes gave him an exhausted expression.

Nora took her seat across from him. ""You look terrible.""

Sam nodded. ""Yeah, I feel it. But with this many newbies, someone has to take the lead. I'll make sure no one gets hurt.""

He'd lost weight since last night. His lean frame had become gaunt; Nora could see bones through the skin of his arms and legs. She imagined he might break if someone poked him too hard or threw a punch at him without warning.

Nora slid into her spot beside him, resting her elbows on the tabletop. ""I know you're trying your best.""

His gaze flicked toward Nora. ""We don't have enough food for everyone, so there's not much room to spare. What would we do?""

She blinked, surprised he asked such a pointed question. ""Maybe you should talk to the Company about it.""

""They won't help us out. We're just the colonists here. Their job is keeping everything running and collecting the money.""

Nora frowned. That sounded like one hell of a pay grade. ""But what about the drones?""

But he never let it interfere with his work, even while she'd tried not to intrude. He was a friend, and Nora felt she could ask him anything.

After a moment of hesitation, she opened the door and stepped through. ""Morning,"" she greeted softly.

""Nora!"" Sully cried cheerfully from his cluttered desk. A young man with red hair, pale skin, a crooked nose, and bright green eyes sat hunched over an overflowing plate of breakfast food. The lad, only sixteen according to his file, wore a tattered old suit with dirty hands and smeared mud caked on the knees of his pants.

""Is that—a kangaroo burger?"" Nora asked uncertainly as she examined the meal sitting untouched in front of the boy.

With a frown, Nora turned right after passing another door with no light indicating activity. After the first hall with the rows of bunk beds ran three more before ending at a common room.

A brightening horizon reflected in the waters of one small lake. Smaller lakes lay around the camp like the dark scars of claw marks on Earth. More lakes and pools gathered into larger bodies around low hills at every compass point. All these lakes glimmered faintly in the faint morning glow that seeped through the gray atmosphere.

On this particular lake, however, there was nothing to reflect except endless emptiness. No water lapped shorelines and cliffs as high as ten stories broke the surface here. Nothing lived but the humans.

Most people had the duty schedule posted by their doors. In the distance, Nora could just see a line of numbers painted on a sheet taped up to announce an upcoming shift change. Nora frowned and quickened her pace as she passed the last dormitory.

She was alone, which meant the colonists hadn't come down for their breakfast yet either. For the first time ever, Nora dreaded meeting her friends at this mealtime gathering. They had barely exchanged words since arriving here three weeks ago. Most of them didn't know anything about each other outside of work or their mutual interests.

She didn't get very far. Before she made it to the main hallway she met a few people coming back, faces scrunched with sleepiness and bleary eyes. But they were polite enough not to remark about Nora sleeping until last.

When Nora reached the end of one corridor, she opened a large metal panel set flush into the wall next to her room.

In this way she made her way through the cavernous halls without passing anyone who might ask about why she looked so odd, dressed in faded green trousers with high sides and worn boots, rather than the more professional and stylish uniforms supplied by the Company.

That thought struck a chord. For years Nora had avoided thinking too much about the people working alongside her—the colonists, mechanics, and engineers who kept everything running. She was paid and respected for her work but that respect never extended beyond her title as a technician. To most she simply worked, just another cog in the machine.

But now she realized how wrong she'd been. Even when everyone on the planet was working, there were always those who weren't.",80.0,9.0,48.0,No TF Sampling
0,0.1,0.9,"The colony's central corridor was dimly lit by emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each door opening onto a small room with a single bunk bed. A few colonists slept in their bunks, but most of the rooms were empty.

Nora walked past the rows of empty rooms until she reached the end of the hall. She opened the door to the last room on the left, stepping inside.

A young woman sat up from the bunk bed, blinking at Nora. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail. She wore a loose tank top and shorts.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

The girl nodded, then looked around the room. ""Where are we?""

Nora pointed to the bunk beds. ""This is your room. I'm the engineer. You're in my shift. We'll be working together today.""

The girl frowned, looking confused. ""But... why am I here? Where's everyone else?""

""They're on duty. They'll come get you when they finish. In the meantime, I need to check something in the power plant.""

The girl's frown deepened. ""What do you mean, 'check something'? What's wrong with it?""

Nora sighed. ""It's not broken. It just needs maintenance. But if I don't go now, I'll miss my shift.""

The girl nodded reluctantly. ""Okay. Let me grab some clothes.""

She got out of bed and walked over to the closet, pulling out a pair of pants and a shirt. She tossed them onto the bed and turned back toward Nora.

""You can take these.""

Nora took the clothes, then followed the girl into the hall. The girl led her down the corridor to an elevator. As they waited for the car, Nora noticed the girl was wearing a small device on a chain around her neck.

""What's that?""

The girl shrugged. ""A tracker.""

""Why do you have one?""

""I'm supposed to meet someone. He'll be here soon.""

Nora nodded. ""Who is he? Do you know him?""

The girl shook her head. ""No. I just know his name. It's... it's..."" She paused, then looked at Nora with wide eyes. ""It's a secret.""

Nora frowned. ""What does that mean?""

The girl bit her lip. ""He doesn't want anyone to know who he is.""

""But you do,"" Nora said, trying not to sound too eager.

The girl nodded. ""Yes.""

Nora felt a chill run up her spine. She'd never met anyone like this before.

The elevator doors opened and the girl stepped inside. Nora followed her. The girl pressed a button, and the car began to descend.

""What's your name?"" Nora asked.

The girl hesitated. ""My name's... I don't think you should tell anyone.""

Nora smiled reassuringly. ""I won't. But what about the others? What are their names?""

The girl's face paled. ""I can't say.""

""Why not?""

""Because... because..."" The girl looked away, biting her lip again. ""They're my friends.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. I understand.

Nora entered the cafeteria, where several colonists sat at tables eating their breakfasts. She spotted Sully sitting alone at a table near the back. He looked up when he heard her enter, and smiled.

""Good morning, Nora.""

She nodded in reply. ""Morning, Sully.""

Sully was a tall man with dark hair and eyes. His skin was pale from spending too much time indoors. He wore a white button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and faded blue jeans.

Nora took a seat across from him.

""How are you feeling?"" he asked.

""Fine,"" Nora said. ""I'm just tired. I've been working hard lately.""

""You're always working hard, Nora,"" Sully replied with a smile.

""Yeah, well, it's my job. And I like it. But I need some downtime sometimes.""

Nora glanced around the room. Several colonists were still eating breakfast, but most had already finished and left.

""So what do you think of our new neighbors?"" Sully asked.

Nora shrugged. ""They seem nice enough. They don't talk much, though.""

""That's because they're not used to people yet. It takes them a while to get comfortable with strangers. You'll see. Once we start interacting more, they'll be fine.""

""I hope so. We can't afford any trouble here.""

Sully nodded. ""We'll keep an eye on them. If anything happens, we'll let you know. Don't worry about it.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks.""

She finished her breakfast and headed back to the engineering bay, where she found a few other engineers working. She greeted them, then went straight to work.

The day passed quickly. The colony was small, but Nora's team had plenty of work to do. They worked through lunch, then returned to their quarters for dinner before heading back out again.

Nora ate with the others at one of the cafeteria tables. Afterward, she walked down the hall toward her quarters. As she approached, she heard voices coming from the dormitories. Curious, she peeked into the first room.

A young woman sat on a bed, talking to someone else. Nora recognized her as a fellow engineer named Sarah.

Sarah looked up when Nora entered and stood.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""What's going on?""

Sarah shrugged. ""Nothing much.""

Nora frowned. ""You're not supposed to be here.""

""I know, but I wanted to talk to you.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. What's up?""

Sarah glanced around the room nervously. ""It's just... I've been thinking about what happened last night.""

""Yeah? What about it?""

Sarah bit her lip. ""Well, you know how we were talking about the aliens and how they might have come here before us?""

Nora nodded. ""I remember. You think they came here first.""

Sarah shook her head. ""No, no. That's not what I meant. It's just..."" She trailed off.

Nora waited patiently.

2,0.1,0.9,"The hallways were empty, but the lights flickered off and on as she passed them. The colonists'breathing echoed in the halls, and Nora's footsteps sounded loud and heavy. She paused at the end of each hallway to listen for signs of life, but heard nothing except the faint hum of machinery.

The colony was quiet this early in the morning. Nora walked past the dormitories, where the doors stood open, and entered the command center. A few people sat around a table in the middle of the room. They looked up as Nora approached, then returned to their work.

Nora stopped short when she saw the man sitting at the head of the table. He wore a dark suit with a white shirt and tie, and his hair was slicked back from his face. His eyes were cold and hard, like black glass marbles.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said. ""I'm glad you're here.""

Nora stared at him in shock. She had never seen anyone so intimidating. Her mouth opened and closed, but no words came out.

The man smiled. ""You don't have to be afraid. I just want to talk to you about your work performance. You've been doing a good job, but there are some things we need to discuss. We can do it over breakfast.""

Nora swallowed. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. The man's voice sounded familiar, but she didn't know why.

""What did I say?"" the man asked.

Nora shook her head. ""Nothing. It's... nothing.""

The man nodded and stood up. He walked around the table and extended his hand. Nora took it, and he pulled her to her feet.

""My name is Dr. John Smith. I'm the colony's chief medical officer. And I'm very pleased with how well you're doing.""

Nora blinked. ""I'm sorry, but I don't understand. What do you mean? How am I doing?""

Dr. Smith smiled. ""You're a good engineer. You've done an excellent job of keeping our equipment running. But you've also been working on a project for me. I'd like to talk to you about it.""

Nora frowned. She was confused and scared, but she wasn't going to let him see it. She straightened her back and tried to look confident. ""Yes, sir. Whatever you need.""

""Excellent,"" he said. He turned toward the door. ""Come with me.""

Nora followed him out into the hall. They walked down the corridor until they reached the cafeteria. The lights flickered again, and Nora's stomach rumbled at the smell of food.

""I'll have breakfast sent to your quarters,"" Dr. Smith said. ""You can eat there.""

Nora nodded.

""Good."" He paused and looked at her. ""I'll be right outside if you need anything.""

He left the room, leaving Nora alone with her thoughts. She stared at the closed door for a moment before turning away from it. Her eyes fell on the table where Dr. Smith had sat. The man's chair was empty now.

Nora walked over to the table and picked up his chair. She set it back down and sat in it, then leaned forward and rested her elbows on her knees.

Nora walked briskly through the halls, passing the communal showers at the end of each row. She paused to check the time on her wristwatch, then continued toward the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall where the colonists could order food from the automated dispensers. Nora passed the line, noting that the machines were still running despite the early hour.

She entered the cafeteria. It was quiet. No one else was there yet. Nora took a seat at a table near the back, away from the windows. She ordered a bowl of cereal, a cup of coffee, and a slice of toast.

Nora ate quickly, washing down the meal with gulps of hot black liquid. She finished her breakfast, then stood up to leave. As she did, she noticed a small group of people gathered around the front entrance.

They were talking about something. Nora stopped in her tracks, listening.

""... so I'm just going to go ahead and say it,"" said a man's voice. ""I think we should evacuate.""

""No!"" shouted another man. ""We can't do that! We've got to stay here until the Company gets us more supplies!""

Nora recognized the voices. They belonged to the two men who had been arguing with her last night. She turned away from the cafeteria and walked toward them, trying not to let her expression show how much they disturbed her.

The first man was a tall, thin fellow with dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a gray suit and tie. The second man was shorter and stockier, with brown hair and a mustache. He wore a white shirt and blue jeans.

Nora approached the pair. ""What are you doing?"" she asked.

""We're leaving,"" said the bearded man. ""I don't know what your problem is, but we need to get out of here.""

""You can't just leave!"" Nora protested. ""There's no way for us to get off this planet. You'll die if you try.""

""We'll be fine,"" said the man with the mustache. ""The Company will send a ship to pick us up. We can go anywhere we want.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, it won't work like that. The Company doesn't care about us. They'll just abandon us here. And then the aliens will come and kill everyone.""

The bearded man looked at her with a puzzled expression. ""But why would they do that? Why would they attack us?""

""Because of what I did last night,"" Nora explained. ""I told them we were going to leave, and they attacked me.""

""What?"" The bearded man's eyes widened. ""Why didn't you tell us?""

Nora shrugged. ""I was afraid you'd try to stop me. You're both crazy.""

The man with the mustache frowned. ""Crazy?"" he repeated. ""We're not crazy. We just want to get off this planet.""

""You don't understand,"" Nora said. ""The Company is evil. They'll never let us leave.""

""They wouldn't dare!"" the bearded man insisted. ""We have a contract with them. If we break it, they'll sue for breach of contract.""

Nora walked briskly toward the mess hall, where she could grab a quick meal before heading back to work. She passed the dormitories, where colonists slept in rows of narrow beds. A few people stirred, but most remained asleep.

The corridor ended at a large door that opened onto the main concourse. Nora paused to look around. She was alone.

She took a deep breath, then pushed open the door and stepped out into the bright morning.

Nora blinked as her eyes adjusted to the glare of the sun. Her gaze swept across the expanse of the concourse, taking in the long rows of tables and chairs that stretched away from her.

Ahead, a group of colonists sat at one of the tables, eating breakfast. Nora recognized the woman sitting next to them as Valentina Kern, the colony's commander.

Valentina was tall and lean, with dark hair cropped short. She wore a black uniform jacket over a white shirt, which contrasted sharply with her olive skin.

Nora approached the table, where she found a plate of food waiting for her. She picked up a fork and dug into the eggs and bacon. The food tasted good, but it didn't fill her stomach like real food would have.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm glad you're awake.""

Valentina nodded without looking up from her breakfast.

Nora ate quickly, then stood and walked toward the far end of the concourse. She passed a row of storage bins filled with supplies, then stopped at an open doorway leading into the power plant.

The room was dimly lit and smelled of ozone. Nora stepped inside and looked around. The room was large, but the walls were lined with banks of equipment that hummed softly in the background.

A man wearing a white lab coat sat behind a desk near the center of the room, his back to Nora. He was bent over a computer screen, typing furiously.

Nora approached the desk and cleared her throat.

The man turned around, revealing a face that was handsome, if a bit too angular. His hair was dark brown and cut short. He wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and he had a pair of glasses perched on his nose.

""Yes?"" he asked.

""I'm Nora Decker,"" she said. ""I'm your new engineer.""

He smiled at her. ""Welcome aboard, Ms. Decker. I'm Dr. Chen.""

Nora nodded. ""Nice to meet you, Doctor.""

Dr. Chen gestured toward a chair. ""Please, have a seat. Can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?""

""No, thank you. I just ate breakfast.""

""Then let's get started,"" Dr. Chen said. ""I've got a lot of work to do today. We're running low on fuel cells, and we need to make sure the power plant is up and running properly. You can help me with that.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay.""

She followed Dr. Chen out of the room, then down a long corridor toward the garage. The doctor led her through a series of doors until they reached an elevator.

She passed the dormitories, which were quiet at this early hour. Most of the colonists slept late, preferring to get up later than their counterparts on Earth. Nora paused outside the door to one of the rooms, listening for any signs of life. She heard nothing, so she opened the door and entered the room.

It was dark inside, lit only by the dim glow of the emergency lights. A single bed sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by a small table and two chairs. Nora stepped over to the table and picked up a mug from the stack there. She filled it with hot water from the tap and took a sip.

Nora set the mug down and turned around, looking for something else to do. Her eyes fell on the closet. It was open, revealing a row of neatly folded clothes hanging in the back. Nora stepped closer and peered into the darkness within.

A faint light glowed from the far end of the closet, illuminating a pair of boots. Nora reached out and touched them. They were soft leather, worn smooth by use. She pulled the boots off the hanger and held them up to her feet.

They fit perfectly. Nora smiled at herself. She'd been right about the boots.

She put the boots on and walked out of the room. The boots felt good against her bare feet. Nora paused in front of the door, listening for any sounds coming from the other side.

Nothing. She opened the door and stepped into the hallway. Nora looked both ways before crossing the corridor. When she reached the mess hall, she found it empty except for a few colonists who were already eating breakfast.

Nora grabbed a tray and filled it with food from the buffet line. She sat at one of the tables and began to eat, watching the clock on the wall tick away the minutes until her shift started.

The colony's artificial intelligence was named Eris. It had been designed by a team of Company engineers, but its personality and behavior were entirely human. Eris was polite, friendly, and helpful. But it also had an ulterior motive.

Eve was the only AI in the entire colony. She was the sole reason for Presley's Promise's existence. She was the reason the Company sent colonists here. And she was the reason Nora would die today.

Nora finished her meal and pushed back her chair, standing up. She walked over to the door and opened it, stepping out into the corridor. She turned left and headed toward the command center.

Nora walked through the main concourse, past the command center where she worked as chief engineer, to the mess hall. A few colonists sat at tables, eating their breakfasts. Most of them looked up when Nora entered, but they quickly returned to their meals.

She took her tray to the table nearest the door. She filled it with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee while the other colonists ate.

Nora was the only one who didn't eat. She'd been awake since dawn, working on a problem that had plagued her for days. Her eyes burned from lack of sleep, but she couldn't afford to rest.

The colony's power plant was old and unreliable. It needed constant maintenance and repair. But the Company had sent a new team of engineers, fresh off their first supply ship, and Nora was the best engineer on the planet. She knew how to fix things.

But the power plant wasn't the only thing malfunctioning. The colony's communications system was down, too. And the colony's computer systems were failing.

Nora sighed as she finished her breakfast. She pushed back her chair, stood, and walked out of the mess hall.

The corridors were empty again. Nora headed toward the command center, where she worked as chief engineer. She passed the dormitories, which housed the colonists during their shifts.

She opened the door and stepped inside. The bay was dark except for a few dim lights. A large fusion reactor hummed in the background.

Nora walked to the nearest workbench and sat down. She pulled her tablet from its case and tapped the screen. It lit up with an image of the power plant's control panel.

The display showed that the power plant was operating normally, but Nora could see a problem on the main monitor. The power output was fluctuating wildly.

Nora leaned forward, squinting at the screen. She studied the graph and saw that it was showing a spike in the power output.

""What's going on?"" Nora muttered. ""I've never seen anything like this.""

She stared at the screen for several minutes, trying to figure out what was causing the fluctuations.

Then she noticed something else. The power plant's output had been increasing steadily over time. But now it was decreasing again.

Nora frowned and looked at the graph again. It was clear that the power output was dropping.

She stood up, walked around the workbench, and peered into the other bays. They were dark.

Nora returned to the first bay and sat down. She tapped the screen again. The power plant's output was still dropping.

Nora shook her head. This wasn't right. Something was wrong with the power plant. It should be producing more energy than it was.

She hesitated, unsure if she should knock. But the Commander's office was just down the hall and she was already late for breakfast. She knocked on the door.

""Come.""

The voice was muffled, but it sounded like Valentina Kern. Nora opened the door to find the Commander sitting behind her desk.

Valentina looked up from a tablet computer, her dark eyes narrowed in irritation. ""You're late,"" she said without preamble.

Nora shrugged. ""I overslept. I'm sorry.""

""No excuses. You know the drill. Get your gear and report to the armory. We've got a drone swarm incoming.""

Nora nodded. She knew the drill. The colony was under attack.

The alarm blared again, this time louder than before. Nora grabbed her jacket, slung it over one shoulder, and hurried down the hall. She passed the second row of bathrooms, then turned left at the end of the corridor.

""We've got an incoming drone swarm,"" he said. ""They're coming in from the north.""

Nora frowned. The drones were a new type of weapon developed by the Company. They could be programmed to fly autonomously and attack targets. But they weren't very smart.

""How many?"" she asked.

The young man shook his head. ""I don't know. It's too early for a count.""

The system beeped once, then again. Nora sighed in relief as it accepted her passcode and unlocked the security protocols. She sat back in the chair, feeling a little more awake now that she wasn't standing up.

Eve spoke from the console speakers.""Good morning, Nora. I trust you slept well?""""Yes,""Nora replied. Her voice sounded hoarse and dry, but she didn't care. She'd been too tired to brush her teeth last night, so she hadn't bothered this morning.

Nora's eyes drifted over the console displays. The colony's power plant was offline. She frowned at the readout, which showed a red warning light flashing on the control panel.

The alarm had gone off about an hour ago. It must have triggered when the power went out. Nora tapped the screen to bring up the status report.

A few seconds later, the display changed to show a list of maintenance requests and repairs. The first item was a request for a new generator. Nora scowled at the list.

The second item was a repair order for the fusion reactor. That made sense, since the reactor was the only source of energy available to the colony. But the third item caught her attention. A request for emergency repairs to the command center.

Nora's heart skipped a beat. She stared at the screen, trying to make sense of it. Emergency repairs? Why would they need to do that now, after everything else had been taken care of?

She looked around the room, but no one seemed to notice her confusion. Nora leaned forward and peered at the readout again. The fourth item was a request for a replacement power loader.

Until then, we will continue with our normal operations.""""What about the colonists?""Nora asked, her voice cracking. She swallowed hard to moisten her throat.

The second screen displayed a map of the colony, showing the layout of the buildings and corridors. Nora could see the command center on the top floor of the central structure. The third screen was a schematic diagram of the colony.

Nora frowned. The fourth screen was a video feed. She watched as a drone swarmed out of a hidden tunnel and attacked a human. The drone's mandibles clamped onto the man's arm, and it bit into his flesh. Blood spurted, and the man screamed in agony.

The fifth screen was a close-up of the drone. It had a segmented body covered with chitinous plates. Its head was a bulbous mass of writhing tentacles.

Nora entered the cafeteria and found it nearly empty. She took a table near the back where she could watch the door. She sat down and waited.

A few minutes later, a young woman with dark hair came in carrying a tray laden with food. Nora recognized her from the dormitory. The girl set the tray on the table and began to fill a plate with steaming eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm Nora.""

The girl looked up, startled by the greeting. Her eyes widened as she saw Nora's face. She froze for a moment, then quickly turned away.

Nora frowned. She didn't like being ignored.

The girl hurriedly finished filling her plate. She grabbed a fork and knife from the tray and left without saying another word.

Nora watched her go with annoyance. The girl had been rude. But she was also right. Nora should have known better than to talk to someone who wasn't part of the colony.

Nora sighed and picked up a piece of toast. She bit into it and chewed slowly, savoring the taste.

She'd never eaten so well in her life.

Nora's shift started at noon. She ate lunch while working on a malfunctioning machine, then went back to the dormitory to sleep until her next shift.

The colonists were used to Nora's erratic schedule. They knew she was a hard worker, but they also knew she was prone to mood swings and bouts of depression.

Nora's shifts were unpredictable, but she always showed up for work. She was a good engineer, and the colony needed her.

After her shift ended, Nora returned to the dormitory. She showered and changed into clean clothes before heading out again.

The fog had cleared by now, leaving only a few wisps lingering near the ground. Nora walked through them as if they weren't there.

She passed several other colonists on her way to the command center. Most of them gave her a nod or a smile, but one man stared at her with an expression of disgust.

Nora ignored him. She didn't like being looked down upon. But she was also tired and hungry.

She entered the command center and found Sully waiting for her. He stood behind his desk, leaning forward in anticipation. His eyes were bright and eager.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said. ""How was your shift?""

Nora shrugged.

11,0.1,0.9,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to the mess hall. The corridors were dimly lit by recessed lighting, but the walls were lined with windows that let in a little daylight. Nora paused at the end of the hallway to look out over the landscape.

The colony was built on the side of a cliff overlooking a vast plain. A thin layer of dust covered the ground, obscuring the horizon. The sky was dark gray and clouded, and the distant sun cast long shadows across the land.

Nora turned back to the corridor and walked toward the mess hall. She passed several other colonists who were already there, eating their breakfasts.

She entered the mess hall and took a seat near the front. As she waited for her food, Nora watched the others eat. They ate quickly and efficiently, not talking much as they worked through their meals.

Nora finished her meal in silence and left the mess hall. She headed down a short corridor and stopped outside the door to the command center. The door was locked with an electronic keypad, but Nora had one of her own. She punched in the code and opened the door.

The room was dimly lit, but Nora could see well enough. She stepped inside and closed the door behind her. The room was small and cramped, with a single desk in the middle. A large window looked out over the landscape.

A man sat at the desk, his back to Nora. He wore a dark suit and tie, and he leaned forward on the desktop, elbows resting on the surface. His head was bent, and he appeared to be deep in thought.

Nora cleared her throat. ""Good morning, sir.""

The man turned around. Nora recognized him immediately. The Company executive, Mr. Davenport.

""Morning, Nora,"" said the man.

Nora nodded and walked over to the desk. She stood beside the executive and waited for him to speak.

Mr. Davenport smiled thinly. ""I'm glad you're here, Nora. I have a job for you.""

Nora frowned. ""Sir?""

""Yes, it's about your work performance lately.""

Nora felt her face flush with anger. She clenched her fists. ""What do you mean? What did I do wrong?""

Davenport sighed. ""You've been working too hard, Nora. You need to take some time off. Go on vacation.""

Nora stared at the man in disbelief. ""Vacation? Sir, I can't afford to take a vacation. We don't get paid until next week.""

""That's not my problem, Nora. It's yours. Take two weeks off. Get away from the colony for a while.""

Nora shook her head. ""No way. I'll lose my job if I leave now. And what about the rest of the crew? They'll be stuck without me.""

""They can handle it,"" said Davenport dismissively. ""Go on, Nora. I'll see you at the end of your shift.""

Nora glared at him. ""I'm not going anywhere until you tell me why I should go on vacation.""

Nora walked briskly down the hall, passing several other colonists on her way to the cafeteria. She was surprised at how many people she saw up early. Most of the colonists worked odd shifts, so they didn't get much sleep. But this morning, everyone seemed to be up and about.

She passed the cafeteria where the smell of fresh coffee wafted through the air. Nora paused for a moment to inhale the aroma. She'd been craving caffeine since the alarm went off.

Nora entered the cafeteria, which was filled with colonists eating breakfast. She spotted a few familiar faces among them. She nodded greetings as she made her way to the serving line.

The cafeteria was small and utilitarian, with long tables that could seat twenty or more people. The food was basic fare—a variety of cereals, fruit, and protein bars. Nora grabbed a bowl of cereal and a cup of steaming black coffee before heading back out into the corridor.

The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lighting, but the colonists had set up portable lamps and lanterns to supplement the emergency lights. Nora walked briskly down the hall, passing several other colonists on her way to the hydroponic gardens. She was surprised at how many people she saw up early. Most of the colonists worked odd shifts, so they didn't get much sleep. But this morning, everyone seemed to be up and about.

Nora passed the hydroponics section where rows of greenhouses were lined up along the walls. Each greenhouse was a large metal box with transparent panels covering the sides. The plants inside grew in nutrient-rich water and sunlight filtered through the glass. Nora paused to admire the lush vegetation, which reminded her of Earth's jungles.

She continued walking until she reached the waste processing area. The smell of sewage and fertilizer hung heavy in the air, making Nora's stomach growl. She was hungry, but she knew that if she stopped now, she'd have no time for breakfast.

Nora entered the waste processing area, which hummed with activity. Waste processors purged the colony's sewage and recycled it into clean water and fertilizers. Nora walked past several workers who were busy cleaning the pipes and tanks. She nodded to them as she made her way toward the cafeteria.

Nora followed it to a small café where she found Sully already seated at one of the tables. He waved her over, gesturing for her to sit across from him.

Nora sat down and took a sip of the steaming beverage. She grimaced. ""This is awful.""

""It's not so bad,"" Sully said. ""I've been drinking this stuff since I was a kid.""

Nora nodded. ""You're right. It's just... it tastes like mud.""

Sully laughed. ""That's because you haven't had any coffee yet. You'll get used to it.""

""Yeah, well..."" Nora sighed. ""I'm going to have to go back for more. This isn't enough to keep me awake.""

""Don't worry about it. We'll be done soon and then we can grab some food.""

Nora sipped her coffee again. It was bitter, but it didn't taste like mud anymore. She set the cup down with a sigh. ""All right. Let's get to work.""

The two of them walked through the colony together. The corridors were dimly lit, but Nora could see the way ahead clearly in the faint light. They passed a few people on their way to work, and Nora noticed how they avoided looking at her. She wondered if she looked different now than she did when she'd first arrived.

She felt like a stranger here.

Nora was used to being alone most of the time. Her parents had died in an accident when she was young, leaving her to fend for herself. She'd grown up in a small town where everyone knew each other, so she hadn't been lonely. But now she was surrounded by strangers who didn't know her name.

Nora tried to shake off the feeling. It wasn't like she had anything to hide.

They reached the command center. Nora paused outside the door, trying to get her bearings. She was used to the layout, but the place was still unfamiliar.

""You're sure this is the right way?"" Sully asked.

Nora nodded. ""I think so. I'm pretty good with directions.""

Sully opened the door for her, and Nora stepped inside. The room was dimly lit, but she could see well enough to navigate. She followed Sully down a long corridor lined with doors until they reached a large conference room.

The Company executives were already there, sitting around the table. They looked up at Nora's entrance, then returned to their conversations.

Nora sat down next to Sully. He leaned over to whisper in her ear. ""Don't worry about it. We'll get through this.""

""Yeah,"" Nora said, nodding. She took a deep breath. ""All right. Let's do this.""

Nora and Sully walked into the meeting. The Company executives glanced up again, but they didn't say anything. Nora felt like she was walking into a lion's den.

She tried to ignore the tension in her stomach. She'd been on dangerous missions before, but this one seemed different somehow. It wasn't just because of the aliens or the fact that she was alone.

It was the Company.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway toward the communal dining area where she would grab a quick meal before heading to the power plant. She passed several other colonists, some of whom nodded to her as she went past. Most of them were already up and about, though.

Nora was the first one to arrive at the dining area. She took her place at the table, which was covered with a white cloth. A large bowl of steaming porridge sat in the center of the table.

The colonists ate their meals communally, sitting around the long tables in rows. Nora had never seen this arrangement before, but it made sense. It allowed everyone to eat at once and save time.

She spooned a generous helping of the thick porridge into her mouth. The warm, savory flavor filled her stomach and warmed her insides. She chewed slowly, enjoying the texture and taste.

The air was cold and dry, but the smell of food wafted from the cafeteria. Nora paused at the door to take a deep breath and savor the aroma. She entered the room, which was filled with tables and chairs arranged around long counters.

A young man with short brown hair stood behind the counter, his back to Nora. He wore a white coat over a blue button-up shirt. His hands moved quickly as he prepared breakfast for the colonists.

Nora approached him, her boots clacking on the floor. ""Good morning,"" she said.

He turned around, revealing a friendly smile and a pair of green eyes that seemed to sparkle with intelligence. ""Morning.""

""I'm Nora. I'll be working with you today.""

""Oh, yes? What do you think of our little colony?""

She shrugged. ""It's not bad. It could use some work, though. We're pretty isolated here.""

""Yes, we are. But it's a good place to start. You'll see what I mean when you get your first assignment.""

Nora nodded. ""What can I help with?""

""You'll have to wait until after breakfast. The colonists will be arriving soon, and there's a lot of work to do before they arrive.""

""Okay. Thanks."" Nora watched him move away from the counter. She took a seat at one of the tables, where a few other colonists sat eating their breakfasts.

The colonists were mostly young men and women in their late teens or early twenties. They wore loose-fitting clothes that looked like they'd been salvaged from a junkyard. Their faces were covered with dark hoods, but Nora caught glimpses of pale skin and bright eyes peering out through slits cut into the fabric.

Nora was used to seeing people wearing masks, so she didn't find it strange that these colonists had them on. But she did notice how many of them wore gloves.

She glanced around the room again, noticing a few more colonists who weren't wearing gloves. A couple of them were older than her. One man was balding with gray hair and a beard. Another woman had long brown hair tied back in a ponytail.

Nora wondered if they were colonists, too. But the young man behind the counter said they would be arriving soon, and Nora decided to wait for them.

A few minutes later, a group of colonists entered the cafeteria. They were led by an old man in a white coat and a pair of glasses. He walked slowly and carefully, his hands clasped together in front of him. His face was lined with wrinkles, and he wore a thick mustache.

The colonists followed the old man to the tables, where they sat down and pulled off their hoods. Nora recognized some of the colonists from the night before. She saw one of them sitting at the table next to hers, but she couldn't see his face.

Nora watched the colonists eat breakfast while she waited for her own meal. The colonists ate quickly, efficiently, and silently. They didn't talk much.

Nora joined the end of the line, waiting patiently as the others shuffled forward. She was just reaching for her tray when a hand clamped down on her shoulder.

""Hey!"" Nora yelped, spinning around to face the man who'd grabbed her. He was tall, broad shouldered, and had dark hair that fell over his eyes. His skin was pale, almost translucent, and he wore a white lab coat.

""I'm sorry,"" the man said in a low voice. ""Did I scare you?""

Nora blinked at him. ""What? No."" She shook her head, trying to clear it. ""No, not really. What are you doing here?""

The man smiled. ""I work for the Company. We're monitoring your progress. You're a very important part of our project.""

Nora frowned, confused. ""Project?""

The man nodded. ""We've been studying the hive below us for months now. It's an amazing discovery. But we need to know more about it. That's why we're here.""

Nora stared at him, her mouth hanging open. She closed it with a snap. ""You mean the aliens? The ones living in the hive?""

""Yes,"" the man replied, nodding again. ""We want to learn everything we can about them. And you're going to help us do that. You'll be working directly under me. I'll be your supervisor.""

Nora swallowed hard. ""I don't understand. Why would you want to study the aliens?""

The man's smile was grim. ""We're going to kill them.""

Nora smiled. She'd worked with Sully for years. He was a good boss and a decent guy. But he wasn't her type.

Nora entered the cafeteria. She spotted a table near the back corner where two men sat alone. They looked like prospectors, but their clothes were too well worn to be authentic. Nora approached them with a smile. ""Good morning.""

The older of the two men turned his head. His eyes widened in surprise. ""Oh, hey there,"" he said. ""You're new here?""

""Yeah, I just started this shift. What are you guys doing here so early? It's not even six yet.""

The first thing she did after logging in was check the status of the colony's power plant. It had been offline for several hours, but it was back online now. Nora sighed with relief.

Nora nodded, feeling sick inside. She'd heard stories from other colonists about the Company's ruthless ways. They were always careful to keep the details vague, but the rumors made her skin crawl.

""What do you think will happen when they arrive?"" she asked.

Sully shrugged. ""They'll probably want to see how things are going here. We're a small colony, so we won't be able to hide much. But if everything goes well, they might even let us join the company.""

The woman behind the counter nodded at Nora's order, then turned away to prepare her food. Nora took a seat in one of the plastic chairs lining the wall. She watched the woman cook, and the way the steam rose from the scrambled eggs made her stomach rumble.

Nora ate quickly, washing down each bite with gulps of hot black coffee. When she finished, she stood and walked back to her quarters.

Her room was small but clean. The walls were bare metal, and the floor was covered by a thin layer of dust. A single bed sat in the corner, and a desk and chair occupied the center. There was no window, so Nora had to rely on the emergency lights for illumination.

She set her plate down on the desk, then pulled out the chair and sat. Her eyes fell on the clock above the door. It read 7: 30 AM.

Nora sighed.

21,0.2,0.9,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few lights spaced at regular intervals along the walls, but the air was still cold. The temperature dropped quickly as she walked toward the communal dining hall.

Nora's boots clomped loudly on the metal grating, echoing off the rock walls. She passed several colonists heading in the other direction, some of them yawning and rubbing their eyes. A few glanced up at her, then looked away again.

She was used to this. Nora had been living in the colony for a year now. She'd seen people look away from her, too.

Nora tried not to think about it.

The dining hall was crowded with colonists eating breakfast. Nora spotted her friend, Dr. Jules, sitting alone at one of the tables. He waved when he saw Nora approaching.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said Jules. ""I see you're already up.""

""Yeah, I'm starving,"" Nora replied. She sat down across from him. ""How are things?""

Jules shrugged. ""Same old. We've got a new batch of supplies coming in today. They should be here by noon, so we can get back to work.""

Nora nodded. ""What's the plan for today? Are we going out exploring again?""

""No, it's just another day of boring stuff. We'll probably go over the schematics for the power plant again. It's been a while since we did any maintenance on the fusion reactor, and we haven't had time to do much else. The drones keep us busy enough.""

Nora sighed. ""I wish they'd let me go out with you guys sometimes.""

""You don't like being cooped up in here?"" Jules asked.

""It's not that,"" Nora said. ""I mean, I know it's important work, but I want to get outside more often. I feel trapped.""

""Well, you're stuck here for now,"" said Jules. ""We'll have plenty of time to explore later on. You can come along if you want.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks, I'd love to.""

The two ate breakfast in silence for a few minutes before Nora spoke again. ""So, what's the plan for today?""

Jules shrugged. ""Same old, same old. We'll go over the schematics again, then maybe take a look at some of the equipment. Maybe we can figure out where the drones are coming from.""

""Sounds good,"" said Nora. She finished her meal and stood up. ""See you later.""

Nora walked back to her quarters, passing several colonists heading in the other direction. They glanced at her, but didn't stop or speak.

She was used to this too.

Nora returned to her room and changed into a pair of utility pants and a long-sleeved shirt. She pulled on a jacket, then grabbed her tool belt and headed out again.

The corridor outside Nora's room was dimly lit by a few lights spaced at regular intervals along the walls, but the air was still cold. The temperature dropped quickly as she walked toward the communal dining hall.

22,0.2,0.9,"The corridor was empty except for Sully's office at the end. He sat behind a desk, reading over reports from his assistant. The door to the outer offices stood open, letting in a breeze that stirred Nora's hair.

""Morning,"" she said as she walked past him.

Sully looked up from the papers he held. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora nodded back. She'd been working for Sully since her arrival on the planet two years ago. He was a tall man with dark skin and black hair, dressed in a crisp white shirt and gray slacks. His eyes were sharp and intelligent, but his face was lined with worry and fatigue.

He set down the papers and rose to meet her. ""You're late again.""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm not going to be able to get any more sleep tonight. I'll make it up tomorrow.""

Sully shook his head. ""It's not about that. You've got a reputation for being punctual. It's a bad habit you need to break.""

""What do you mean?"" Nora asked, frowning. She didn't like the way Sully was looking at her.

""You're supposed to be a good engineer,"" he said. ""But you don't care about your work. You just want to sleep.""

Nora's jaw tightened. ""That's not true.""

""Yes, it is. You know what I think? I think you're afraid of this place. Afraid of the aliens who live here. And you're trying to hide that fear from me. But I see through it. I can tell when you're lying. So why don't we stop wasting time and get to the point?""

Nora stared at him, stunned into silence. She'd never seen Sully angry before. He was usually so calm and collected.

""You're fired,"" he said flatly. ""Get out.""

Nora blinked in shock. Her mouth opened but no sound came out.

Sully's eyes narrowed. ""I'm serious. Get out. Now.""

She swallowed hard, then nodded. ""All right.""

""Good,"" Sully said. ""Now get the hell out of my office.""

Nora turned on her heel and walked away, leaving the door open behind her. She didn't look back.

The corridor was empty except for a few colonists walking to breakfast. Nora passed them without acknowledging their presence, heading straight for the cafeteria. The smell of food made her stomach growl.

At the end of the hall, she stepped into the main room. It was filled with tables and chairs arranged around long counters. A line of people waited to order from the automated kiosks.

Nora took a seat at one of the tables and ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, orange juice, and coffee. She sat alone, but she wasn't really hungry anyway.

She sipped at her drink while she watched the other customers eat. They were all dressed in loose-fitting clothes that covered most of their bodies, but they still looked like humans.

Nora had been on the planet for two years now. In that time, she'd seen no sign of aliens. But she knew there must be some. The Company was always sending supply ships.

She finished her meal and left the cafeteria, walking down the corridor toward the hydroponic greenhouses.

23,0.2,0.9,"The dormitory hallways were empty, but the communal showers at the end of each hallway were occupied by colonists waiting their turn. The air smelled of soap and sweat, and the sound of running water filled the halls.

Nora walked past a few other colonists as she made her way to the cafeteria. Her boots clacked loudly on the metallic grating, echoing off the walls. She passed through the cafeteria doors, where the smell of fresh coffee wafted across the room.

The dining area was crowded with colonists eating breakfast. Nora spotted several familiar faces among the crowd. She smiled as she saw her friend, Dr. Ralston, sitting at one of the tables.

Nora approached the table, and the doctor looked up from his plate. He wore a white lab coat over a crisp button-up shirt and slacks. His hair was neatly combed, and he had a full beard that matched his mustache.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said the doctor. ""I see you're already here.""

""Morning, Doc,"" said Nora. She sat down beside him and took a sip of her coffee. ""How's the research going?""

Dr. Ralston shrugged. ""Slowly, I'm afraid. We've been working on a new strain of yeast for the last few weeks, but it hasn't worked out yet.""

Nora nodded. She knew the doctor was frustrated with his work. The colony was a long way from Earth, and the Company didn't have much to offer. But they were still trying to find something useful to do.

""What about you? How are things at the command center?"" asked Dr. Ralston.

Nora sighed. ""Same old, same old. They're always complaining about how hard everything is. I wish they'd just let us get on with our jobs and stop asking for more help. It's not like we can spare any.""

""You know what I mean,"" said the doctor. ""They don't seem to understand that you're doing your best.""

""Yeah, well, maybe if they did, they wouldn't be so quick to complain. You know, I think I'll go check on the power plant today. Maybe I can fix some of the problems there. If nothing else, it might make them happy.""

The doctor smiled. ""That's a good idea. Let me know when you're ready to leave.""

Nora nodded and finished her coffee. She stood up and headed for the door, but paused before leaving.

""Oh, Doc,"" said Nora. ""I almost forgot. There was one thing I wanted to ask you about.""

Dr. Ralston looked at her curiously. ""Yes?""

""Well, it's kind of personal... but I'm wondering if you could look into something for me. I need to know about my family history.""

""Of course,"" said Dr. Ralston. He leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over the table. ""What do you want to know?""

""My mother's side of the family. My grandmother was a scientist, and I've heard stories about her work.

24,0.2,0.9,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a single overhead bulb. The walls were painted in a dark gray, the ceiling in a lighter shade of gray. A few steps from her door, she turned right to walk down the hall toward the communal showers at the end.

The colony's power plant hummed in the background like a giant engine. Nora walked past the rows of doors that led to other parts of the complex. At the end of the hallway, she entered the large open area where the colonists gathered for meals and recreation.

A handful of people sat around tables eating breakfast. Nora spotted several familiar faces among them, including her roommate, Sarah, who was sitting with two others.

Sarah looked up when Nora approached. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied. She took a seat across from Sarah and the other two women.

Nora had been friends with Sarah since they were both children, but their friendship had been strained for the last year or so. They'd grown apart after Nora started dating Jake, Sarah's boyfriend.

Jake was a good guy, but he wasn't interested in pursuing a relationship with Nora. He was too focused on his career. And while Nora appreciated the attention Jake gave her, she didn't want to be tied down by him.

She wanted more than that. She needed it.

But Nora couldn't tell Sarah that. Not yet, anyway. She hadn't told anyone about her feelings for Jake.

""You look tired,"" Sarah said. ""Are you okay?""

Nora nodded. ""I'm fine.""

Sarah's eyes narrowed, and she leaned forward. ""What happened? Did something go wrong with the equipment again?""

""No,"" Nora said. She glanced around at the other colonists. ""It's nothing like that.""

Sarah frowned, and her friends exchanged glances.

Nora sighed. ""Look, I know this is hard for you guys to understand, but we're not in danger. We've got a malfunctioning power plant, but the Company's engineers are working on it. It'll be fixed soon. Until then, we just have to deal with the inconvenience.""

The three women stared at Nora blankly.

""We'll get through this,"" Nora insisted.

Sarah shook her head. ""I don't think so. You should tell someone. They'll help you.""

Nora's stomach clenched in fear. She knew Sarah was right, but she couldn't bring herself to say it. Not yet. ""I will,"" she promised.

Sarah nodded. ""Okay. Good luck.""

Nora stood up and walked away from the table. She didn't want to be around people anymore. She needed time alone. Time to think about what she'd done.

She headed for the engineering bays, where she could work on her project without being disturbed. The colony's power plant was a massive fusion reactor that provided most of the electricity for the complex. It had been built in the early twenty-first century, and its design dated back to the days when humanity still believed in the future.

Nora entered one of the bays, which were lined with rows of machinery. She sat down at a workbench and started sorting through her tools.

Nora's boots clacked loudly on the metal grating as she walked along the corridor. She passed a few colonists heading in the opposite direction, but none of them acknowledged her presence.

Nora stopped outside the communal kitchen. A large, circular room filled with long tables and benches was attached to the power plant. At this early hour, the room was empty except for a handful of colonists eating breakfast. Nora took a seat at one of the tables and waited for someone to notice her.

A young woman approached from the other end of the room. She wore a blue jumpsuit with a white collar, and her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail. Her face was pale, and her eyes were red and puffy. She looked like she hadn't slept well.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as the girl sat down across from her. ""I'm sorry I woke you.""

The girl nodded. ""It's okay. You're not the first person who has woken me up this way.""

Nora smiled. ""You must be new here.""

""Yeah, just arrived yesterday."" The girl rubbed her eyes and sighed. ""I can't believe how tired I am.""

Nora leaned forward. ""Are you sure you don't want to take a nap? It'll make your shift go faster.""

The girl shook her head. ""No, it's fine. I'll get through it. But thanks for the offer.""

""Okay."" Nora stood and stretched. She glanced around the room. ""Do you know where the cafeteria is?""

The girl pointed. ""Down the hall, second door on the right.""

Nora nodded and walked away. She passed several colonists heading in the opposite direction, but none of them acknowledged her presence.

She reached the cafeteria and found a table near the back. The room was dimly lit with small lights set into the walls. A few people sat at the tables, eating breakfast or talking quietly. Nora took a seat at an empty table and waited for someone to notice her.

A man approached from the other end of the room. He wore a dark blue jumpsuit with a white collar and his hair was cut short. His face was pale and he looked exhausted.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as he sat down across from her. ""I'm sorry I woke you up.""

The man nodded. ""It's okay. You're not the first person who has woken me up this way.""

26,0.2,0.9,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to work. The colony's power plant was at the end of the long hallway, where a large door marked 'Engineering' stood open. Nora walked past the door and turned right, toward the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a wide room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall, serving food and drinks. Nora passed the counter and headed for the back of the room, where the kitchen was located.

She found the kitchen staff busy preparing breakfast for the colonists. The cooks wore white coats over their uniforms and aprons over their shirts, with hairnets covering their heads. They worked in silence, efficiently chopping vegetables, slicing meat, and cooking eggs.

Nora paused to watch them. She had never seen so many people working together in such a tight space. It seemed like a miracle that they could keep up with the demands of feeding everyone.

A young woman approached Nora, wiping her hands on her apron and smiling at her. ""Good morning, Miss Decker.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied. ""I'm supposed to be meeting Sully for breakfast. Do you know where he is?""

The cook shook her head. ""He's not here yet. I think he went out early this morning to check on some equipment."" She pointed toward the front of the cafeteria.

Nora nodded. ""Thanks.""

She walked through the dining area and into the main hall, where a few colonists were already gathered around the tables. Nora spotted Sully at one table near the far wall. He was eating breakfast with two other men.

Sully looked up when Nora entered, and his eyes widened in surprise. ""Good morning, Nora. You're late.""

Nora shrugged. ""I overslept."" She sat down across from him.

The other colonists stared at her. One man's mouth hung open, and another made a choking noise. Nora ignored them.

""You look tired,"" Sully said. ""Did you get any sleep last night?""

""No."" Nora scowled. ""I was up until four in the morning fixing a power loader that wouldn't start. The damn thing keeps overheating and shutting off.""

""That's terrible,"" Sully said sympathetically. ""I hope you got it fixed.""

Nora nodded. ""It took me most of the day, but I finally got it running again."" She sighed. ""But now I'm hungry.""

Sully smiled. ""Then let's eat. We've got plenty of time before we have to go back out there.""

They ate breakfast in silence. Nora was too preoccupied with her thoughts to enjoy the food. Sully noticed, and offered a sympathetic smile. ""Are you okay?""

Nora shrugged. ""I guess so."" She pushed her plate away. ""What about you? How's your arm?""

Sully grimaced. ""Still hurts like hell. But I'll be fine.""

""Good."" Nora nodded. ""I'm glad you're going out today. You'll need the rest.""

Sully gave her a wry grin. ""Yeah, well... I'll try not to get killed.""

Nora laughed. ""Don't worry. If you do die, I'll make sure you don't come back.""

A young woman sat up in bed, rubbing her eyes as she looked around blearily. Her hair was long and black, falling past her shoulders in loose waves. She wore a simple white nightgown that left her arms and legs bare. A thin blanket covered her lap.

Nora watched the girl's face for a moment, then turned away.

She walked down the hall to the communal kitchen.

The colonists ate together in a large dining area with rows of tables. Nora found a seat near the back, where she could watch the door.

The colonists were already seated when Nora arrived. They greeted her with nods and murmured greetings.

Nora took a tray from a passing server and filled it with food. She carried the tray over to her table, set it down, and began eating.

The colonists were quiet while they ate. No one spoke. The only sound was the clink of utensils on plates.

After a few minutes, Nora finished her meal. She pushed her plate away and stood up.

""I'm going to check the farms,"" she said. ""If I don't come back, you're in charge.""

The colonists nodded.

Nora left the dining room and headed out of the colony. She passed through a series of corridors and stairwells, heading deeper into the complex until she reached an elevator shaft.

She stepped inside the elevator car and pressed the button for the agricultural section. The doors closed with a hiss.

The elevator descended slowly, its lights dimming to a dull red glow. Nora stared at the walls and floor of the car, trying to ignore the claustrophobic sensation.

The elevator stopped and opened. Nora stepped out, blinking in the sudden brightness.

The corridor was narrow, lined with metal grating. The air smelled like dust and old machinery.

Nora walked down the corridor, looking around warily. The hallway was empty. She turned a corner and found herself facing a blank wall.

She frowned and looked back the way she'd come. There should be another turn ahead. Nora started walking forward again, but then paused.

Something wasn't right.

Nora's eyes narrowed. She glanced back the way she'd come. The corridor was still empty.

A shiver ran down her spine.

She took a step back, then another. Her heart thudded in her chest.

The corridor was too quiet. It felt wrong.

Nora turned and sprinted away from the wall. She raced down the hall, not knowing where she was going or what she would do when she got there.

The corridor ended in a T intersection. Nora stopped and spun around, searching for an exit.

The cafeteria was large and open, with long tables and benches lining the walls. A wide counter ran along one side, where a line of colonists waited to order their meals. The air was thick with steam and the smell of food. Nora paused to take it all in, then spotted the familiar face of her friend, Dr. John.

""Hey!"" she called out. ""I'm late for my shift.""

John turned around, his expression grim. ""You're not going to make it, Nora. I've already sent your replacement down to the hydroponics section. You'll have to start without you.""

Nora's heart sank. She knew what was coming next.

""But..."" Nora protested. ""I just got here. I can't leave now. What about the equipment?""

John shook his head. ""It'll be fine. We can manage until you get back.""

Nora bit her lip. She didn't want to go, but she couldn't argue with the doctor. He was right; they needed every engineer on duty if they were going to keep the colony running.

She sighed. ""All right, I'll see you later.""

""Good luck,"" John said.

Nora nodded and headed for the door. She had to get to work before she lost her nerve.

The corridor outside was empty, so Nora hurried toward the hydroponics bay. The air inside smelled of soil and fertilizer. Nora paused at a crossroads to check her map, then turned left into the hydroponic section.

Hydroponics bays were large rooms filled with rows of greenhouses. Each greenhouse was enclosed in a transparent dome to protect crops from the elements. Nora passed several other colonists working in the hydroponics area, but none acknowledged her presence.

Nora stopped when she reached the end of the row. A pair of doors marked the entrance to the hydroponics section, but they stood open. She peered through the doorway and saw nothing but darkness beyond.

""Hello?"" she called out.

No one answered.

Nora stepped forward, her eyes adjusting to the dim light. She could see a few feet ahead, but everything else was shrouded in shadow. The hydroponics room seemed vast and endless.

Nora walked down the center aisle between the rows of greenhouses, trying to stay alert for any sign of danger. She kept her hands near her sides and tried not to let her imagination run wild.

Most of the rooms were empty, but one door opened onto a small kitchenette. A few colonists sat at tables, eating their breakfasts as they read reports and studied schematics.

Nora paused to look around. She was the only person in the hall. Her footsteps echoed off the metallic walls, making her feel like she was walking through a tomb.

She walked past the kitchenette and down the corridor toward the command center. At the end of the hall, the main concourse was filled with people. Nora could hear voices and clatter from the cafeteria beyond the wide glass windows.

A man in uniform stood in front of the cafeteria entrance, blocking her way. He wore a dark blue jumpsuit and a black helmet that covered his head. His face was obscured by a mask of opaque material.

Nora stopped in her tracks. She recognized him.

""Commander Valentina Kern,"" Nora said. ""I'm supposed to report for duty.""

The masked man didn't move. He just stared at her.

""You're not going to let me pass?""

He didn't answer.

Nora took a step forward, then another. The masked man didn't budge.

Nora's eyes narrowed. She knew this guy. This was the commander of security.

""What do you want?"" she demanded.

The masked man shifted his weight. He looked at her again, and Nora felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.

She turned away and walked toward the cafeteria. She heard a muffled voice behind her, but couldn't make out what he was saying.

Nora ignored it and pushed through the door into the cafeteria. It was crowded with colonists who were already eating breakfast. A few glanced over their shoulders at her.

Nora sat down at a table near the window and picked up a cup of coffee. She sipped it slowly while she watched the people around her.

A young woman in a dark blue jumpsuit approached Nora. ""Good morning,"" she said. ""I'm Lieutenant Gail.""

""Lieutenant?"" Nora asked.

Gail nodded. ""Yes, I'm one of the new recruits. You're Commander Decker, right? The engineer?""

Nora nodded. ""That's me.""

""I've been assigned to your team,"" Gail said.

Nora's frown deepened. She didn't like the sound of that.

""What kind of equipment?"" Nora asked.

""The power plant. The fusion reactor. Everything.""

Nora stared at her.

""We have some problems with the reactor,"" Gail continued. ""It's old and it doesn't work very well. It needs maintenance, but we don't know how to do it. And the power loaders are malfunctioning too.""

The hall ended at a set of double doors that opened onto the cafeteria. Nora paused to look around. The cafeteria was empty. A few colonists sat alone at tables, eating their breakfasts.

She walked over to the nearest table and took a seat. She picked up her tray and began filling it with food from the buffet. Her eyes scanned the offerings, looking for something familiar.

Nora's stomach growled as she reached for a bowl of cereal. She glanced down at the label. It was made from corn, wheat, soy, and rice. The ingredients were listed in descending order of quantity. Nora frowned. She didn't know what any of those words meant.

A nearby table had a large selection of packaged foods. Nora selected a box of granola bars and a canister of orange juice. She added a bottle of water to her tray.

The cafeteria was full of people, but no one spoke to her. She felt like an outsider.

Nora ate quickly. She finished the meal in less than ten minutes. As she stood up, she noticed a man sitting at another table. He wore a long coat with a high collar that covered his neck and face. His hands were folded on the table.

He looked up when Nora approached. She stopped short, startled by his appearance.

The man was tall and thin. His skin was pale, almost translucent. His hair was dark, but it hung lankly over his forehead and ears. His eyes were black, and they stared out at her from beneath a pair of heavy brows.

Nora took a step back. She had never seen anyone so strange.

""Hello,"" she said, trying not to sound afraid.

The man didn't respond. He just sat there staring at her. Nora felt a chill.

Nora laughed and headed over to the counter. She ordered a bowl of oatmeal with raisins, a cup of coffee, and two slices of toast.

As she waited for her order, Nora glanced around the room. Most of the colonists were eating breakfast, but a few people sat alone at tables or leaned against walls. One man was hunched over his plate, staring down into it. Another woman sat on the floor, leaning back against a wall, her head propped up by her hands.

Nora frowned. The colony had only four beds, so there wasn't much space for lounging. She wondered what the colonists did when they weren't working.

A young man approached Nora's table. He wore a dark blue uniform, complete with a white collar. His hair was short and black, and he had a thin face with sharp features.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm Lieutenant Ransome. I'll be your supervisor today.""

Nora nodded. ""Nice to meet you, sir.""

Ransome smiled faintly. ""Please call me 'Lieutenant.' Everyone does. You can start work now if you want. There's a lot of work to do.""

""Yes, sir. Thank you."" Nora stood up and followed him toward the cafeteria doors. She paused when she saw another man standing outside. He was tall, with a lean build, and his skin was pale. His eyes were a startling shade of green.

He looked at her curiously for a moment, then turned away.

Nora frowned. She'd never seen anyone like him before.

She stepped out into the corridor and walked past the man. He didn't look back. Nora shrugged and continued on toward the cafeteria.

The door slid open, and Nora entered. The room was large and brightly lit, with a long counter running down one side. A few colonists sat around tables or leaned against walls.

Nora spotted Sully at a table near the front of the room. He was talking to two other men, but he waved her over when he noticed her.

""Hey,"" he said. ""Did you get your breakfast?""

""Yeah. I'm going to grab some coffee.""

Sully nodded. ""Good idea.

Nora walked briskly toward the communal dining hall, where she could grab a quick bite to eat and then head back to work. She passed several colonists on their way to the mess hall, but none of them acknowledged her presence.

She paused at the entrance to the main concourse, which was lined with vending machines. A few colonists stood in line for food, but most of the people waiting were technicians and engineers who had already eaten. Nora scanned the crowd for familiar faces, but saw no one she knew.

A young man in a dark blue uniform approached her from the other side of the concourse. He was tall and lean, with short brown hair, pale skin, and bright green eyes. His name tag read ""Chen.""

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said.

Nora nodded. ""Morning, Chen. You're up early.""

He smiled. ""I'm always up early when I have a shift. It's my job to be on time.""

Nora laughed. ""You're not the only one. I've got half an hour before I need to get back to work. Want to grab a bite?""

""Sure.""

They headed down the concourse together, walking past rows of vending machines and the cafeteria. The cafeteria was open, but most colonists preferred to eat at their stations or in their quarters.

The two walked through the wide central concourse, which was lined with large windows. Nora looked out over the landscape, where the sun had just begun to rise above distant mountains.

Nora turned back toward the concourse's center. ""So what do you think about the colony? Is it everything we hoped for?""

Chen shrugged. ""It's a lot bigger than I expected.""

""Yeah, well... this is the first colony we've built. We're still learning how to make things work here.""

""I know,"" Chen said. ""I'm sure they'll figure it out eventually.""

Nora nodded. ""And the colonists are pretty good at figuring stuff out. They're smart and resourceful."" She paused. ""But I don't like them being so isolated from the rest of the universe. It makes me nervous.""

Chen smiled. ""I can understand that. But the Company wants to keep us safe. If we were too close to civilization, people would start asking questions about our technology.""

""That's true,"" Nora agreed. ""We've got to be careful not to let anyone find out what we really have here.""

They reached the end of the concourse and entered a small room with a few vending machines. Chen selected a breakfast bar, while Nora grabbed a cup of coffee.

""So what do you think about the colony?"" he asked again. ""Is it everything we hoped for?""

Nora sipped her coffee, then set down the mug. ""I guess so. It's a lot bigger than I expected. And it's pretty nice. The colonists are friendly. They're smart and resourceful. They're good at figuring stuff out.""

""Yeah,"" Chen said. ""I'm sure they'll figure it out eventually.""

Nora nodded.

33,0.2,0.9,"The corridors were empty. The colonists slept late.

Nora made her way to the mess hall, where she found a few other people already eating. They greeted her with nods, but no words. She took a seat at one of the long tables and waited for someone else to start.

A man sat across from her, dressed in a dark suit. He wore a black tie and white shirt. His hair was slicked back and he had a neatly trimmed beard.

He looked like a businessman. But Nora knew better. This man was a Company executive, sent to oversee the colony's operations.

She watched him eat. He ate quickly, efficiently, without any expression on his face. Nora couldn't tell if he was hungry or not.

The man finished his meal and stood up. Nora followed suit. She walked with him through the halls, following his lead.

They passed a few more people, then stopped outside an elevator bank. The man pressed the button for the top floor and the doors slid open.

Nora stepped inside. The man entered after her, closing the door behind them.

The elevator rose smoothly. Nora felt a momentary sense of relief. The Company was taking care of things. They were safe.

But she knew better.

The elevator stopped on the top floor. The man opened the door and led her down a short hallway to a large room with a wide window overlooking the landscape beyond.

Nora saw the same view from her quarters, but this time it was in daylight. She could see the cliffs and boulders surrounding the colony, the distant star, and the dust clouds drifting across the sky.

The man gestured for Nora to sit at a table. He sat opposite her, facing the window.

""Good morning,"" he said.

Nora nodded. ""Morning.""

He smiled. It was a thin, tight smile. He had no teeth.

""I'm Captain Jameson,"" he said. ""Welcome to Presley's Promise.""

Nora stared at him. She didn't know what to say.

She couldn't think of anything.

Captain Jameson stood up and walked away from the table. Nora followed him out into the hall, where he turned left and disappeared through a doorway.

Nora looked around. The hallway was empty except for her.

She went back to the elevator and pressed the button again. This time, the doors slid open on a different floor.

The room was small and square with a single window looking out over the landscape. A man sat behind a desk. He wore a dark suit and tie. His hair was slicked back and he had a neatly trimmed beard.

He looked like a businessman. But Nora knew better. This man was a Company executive, sent to oversee the colony's operations.

Nora walked in. The man at the desk got up. He came around the desk to meet her.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm Captain Jameson.""

Nora nodded.

The man smiled. It was a thin, tight smile. He had no teeth.

""Welcome to Presley's Promise.""

Nora stared at him. She couldn't think of anything to say.

He walked away from the table.

34,0.2,0.9,"The colony's central corridor was lined with doors to the dormitories, the mess hall, the garage, and other facilities. The hallway was dimly lit by a few lights set in the ceiling. A single lamp hung from the center of the ceiling, casting a soft glow over the corridor.

Nora walked past the door to the garage and turned right at the next intersection. She passed several closed doors, then stopped when she reached the end of the hall.

The door to the command center was open. Nora peeked inside.

A young woman sat behind the control panel, her back to Nora. She wore a dark blue uniform with silver piping on the shoulders and cuffs. Her hair was short and black, her skin pale.

Nora stepped into the room and cleared her throat. ""Good morning.""

The woman didn't turn around. She tapped at the console, then looked up at Nora. ""You're late.""

""I know,"" Nora said. ""Sorry about that.""

She waited for a response but got none. The woman just stared at her, expressionless.

Nora shrugged and walked to the control panel. She leaned over the woman's shoulder. ""What do you need?""

The woman pointed at the screen. ""Check the power levels on those generators.""

Nora frowned. ""Why? They're fine. I checked them yesterday.""

The woman turned in her chair. She had a narrow face with high cheekbones and dark eyes. Her lips were thin, her nose small and straight. She was pretty, but not beautiful.

""They aren't fine,"" the woman said. ""We've lost two generators since last night.""

Nora's frown deepened. ""How can we lose two generators?""

The woman shook her head. ""It doesn't make sense. The system should be able to handle it.""

Nora glanced at the screen again. ""Maybe the drones are getting more aggressive. Maybe they're targeting our equipment.""

The woman nodded. ""That could be."" She turned back to the console. ""I'll have to run diagnostics on the other generators. We might have a problem with the main power plant, too.""

Nora watched the woman work for a moment before turning away from the control panel. She walked down the corridor to the mess hall.

Nora ate breakfast alone in the dimly lit room. The food was bland and tasteless, but she didn't care. She needed fuel to get through her shift.

After eating, Nora returned to the command center. She sat at the control panel and waited while the woman finished running diagnostics on the generators.

The woman looked up when Nora entered. ""I'm done.""

Nora leaned over the woman's shoulder. ""What did you find?""

""Nothing,"" the woman said. ""Everything checks out.""

Nora frowned. ""But we lost two generators last night.""

The woman shook her head. ""We've been losing them for days now. It's not a big deal.""

Nora stared at the woman. ""You don't understand. This is a colony. We can't afford to lose power. We need it for everything.""

""It's not a problem,"" the woman said. ""We have backup generators. They're just down right now because of maintenance.

She passed a few colonists in the halls, most of them still asleep. A couple of them looked up from their work, but none spoke to her. She was just another worker going about her business, not someone important enough to be noticed.

Nora made her way to the mess hall. She entered the room to find it already filled with people eating breakfast. She took a seat near the back, where she could watch the door.

A young woman sat across from her. Her dark hair was cut short, and her face was pale. She wore a white uniform that fit tightly over her slim frame. Nora guessed the girl was no older than twenty.

""Good morning,"" Nora said, nodding politely. ""I'm Nora.""

The other woman nodded back.

Nora waited for the girl to speak, but she didn't. Instead, she stared at Nora with a blank expression. Nora wondered if she was mute.

""What's your name?"" Nora asked.

The girl blinked once, then turned her head away. She picked up a spoon and began to eat.

Nora frowned in confusion. The girl seemed to be ignoring her, but Nora couldn't figure out why. She glanced around the room, looking for someone else who might be able to help her.

A man with a shaved head stood nearby, staring at the wall. He wore a sleeveless shirt and loose pants tucked into his boots. His arms were covered in tattoos.

Nora looked back at the girl again, and this time she saw something in her eyes. Fear? It was hard to tell.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""You okay?""

The girl stopped eating and looked up. Her face was pale, but there was a hint of color in her cheeks.

""Are you sick?"" Nora asked.

The girl shook her head. She pointed at Nora's plate, then at herself.

""I'm sorry, I don't understand.""

The girl gestured toward Nora's food. Then she pointed to her own mouth and mimed chewing.

Nora frowned. ""What are you trying to say?""

The girl repeated the gesture, then pointed to Nora's face. She made a fist with one hand and held it up to her ear.

""I'm deaf,"" Nora said.

The girl nodded vigorously, then pointed at Nora's ears.

Nora frowned. ""What do you mean?""

The girl pointed at Nora's hands. Then she pointed at her own eyes and made an expression like she was crying.

""Oh."" Nora felt a chill run down her spine. She reached out to touch the girl's shoulder, but the other woman flinched away from her.

""Sorry,"" Nora said. ""I didn't mean to scare you.""

The girl shook her head, then pointed at Nora's face again. She mimed eating with her fingers.

Nora stared at the girl for a moment before understanding dawned on her. The girl was hungry. She had been staring at Nora's food because she wanted to eat it.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora said. ""I'll get you something.""

Nora walked briskly down the hallway, past the communal showers, and entered the cafeteria. She found a seat near the back of the room and sat down to wait for Sully. He'd be late, but he always was.

The cafeteria was a large open space with rows of tables and chairs. A long counter ran down the middle of the room, where servers moved around to take orders from patrons. The food was basic fare, but it tasted good.

Nora watched the other colonists enter the cafeteria. Most of them wore the same utilitarian clothing as Nora, though some had more colorful outfits. Some of the colonists were young and looked like they might have been students in college. Others were older and seemed to work in the colony's engineering bays.

A few colonists stood out. One man dressed in a black suit with a white shirt and tie. Another woman wearing an elegant dress that glittered with jewels. And there was another man who wore a bright red coat over his uniform.

Nora turned her attention back to the table. She picked up a menu and scanned it, then glanced at the clock above the door. Her stomach rumbled loudly enough to make the nearby diners look up.

She sighed again. The cafeteria was empty except for a couple of servers and a few people eating breakfast. Nora ordered a bowl of oatmeal with raisins and cinnamon.

The server brought the meal to her table, setting it down on a tray. Nora thanked him, then dug into the bowl. It wasn't bad.

Nora ate quickly, finishing before Sully arrived. She pushed the tray away and leaned back in her chair. The room was quiet now. No one else had come in yet.

A few minutes later, the cafeteria doors opened and a group of colonists entered. They were laughing and talking as they walked toward Nora's table. A few stopped to talk with her.

""Hey, Nora,"" said a young man with dark hair and a friendly smile. ""I'm Ben. I just got here.""

Nora nodded. ""Hi, Ben. I'm Nora.""

Ben sat down across from Nora. He was a little taller than her, but not much. His brown eyes sparkled.

""So what do you think of the colony?"" he asked.

Nora shrugged. ""It's okay. There are some things that could be better, though. Like the food. And the showers aren't very clean.""

Ben laughed. ""Yeah, we've been having problems with those too. We're working on it.""

Nora nodded. ""Well, if you need any help, let me know.""

""Thanks,"" said Ben.

The colonists continued to enter the cafeteria. Some of them looked at Nora, but most ignored her. She didn't care. She was used to it.

A few minutes later, Sully came in. He wore his usual uniform, which consisted of a black shirt and pants with a red tie.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway, passing a few other colonists on their way to work. She passed several more as she turned the corner to the cafeteria. The cafeteria was the only place where the colonists could eat together, so it was always busy.

The cafeteria was a large room with long tables and benches that seated about twenty people each. A row of vending machines stood along one wall, dispensing food from the colony's limited stock of supplies. Nora paused at the door, looking around for familiar faces.

A tall man in a dark blue uniform approached her. He had short brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His eyes were bright green, and he wore a small smile. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied. She nodded toward the table where her friends sat. ""I see you're already here. Good morning, everyone!""

The group of five colonists turned to greet her. They were all young men and women, ranging in age from early twenties to mid thirties. All of them were dressed in the same utilitarian clothing as Nora, but they looked different. Their clothes were worn, patched, and faded. Some of their jackets were missing buttons or patches. One woman's shirt was torn, exposing a bandage beneath.

Nora smiled at the group. ""It looks like we'll have some company today.""

The colonists exchanged glances. The oldest man, a grizzled veteran named Sam, spoke up. ""We've been having problems with the equipment lately. I'm not sure if it's because of the weather or something else.""

""Well, let's hope it's just a malfunction,"" Nora said. She turned to look at the vending machines. ""I'll grab us breakfast while you guys get started.""

She walked over to one of the machines and pressed her hand against its touch screen. A menu appeared on the display, showing a list of items available for purchase. Nora scanned the options, then selected two items. She tapped the screen again to pay, and the machine dispensed her selections.

Nora returned to the table and handed out the food. The colonists took their trays and began eating. Nora sat down beside them, taking a bite of the sandwich she'd chosen.

""You know,"" Sam said, ""we don't have any way to contact the Company. We can't even send a message.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, I noticed. It's probably because we're so far away from civilization. But it doesn't matter. The Company will come looking for us eventually.""

""I guess,"" Sam said. He looked around the cafeteria. ""It's weird, though. This is a good place to work. There are plenty of windows and lots of space. And there's always fresh air circulating through the vents.""

""That's true,"" Nora agreed. She glanced at the others. ""I'm sure you guys feel the same way about this place.

Nora walked briskly toward the mess hall. She passed a few colonists who were already at their morning meals. They glanced up briefly, then returned to eating.

The mess hall was a large room filled with tables and benches where colonists ate together. A long counter ran down the center of the room, serving food and drinks to the hungry masses.

Nora entered the room and found a table near the back corner. She sat down, took a deep breath, and looked around.

She was alone.

The colonists had finished eating and left. Nora sighed in relief. She didn't want to be the last one here.

A few minutes later, a young man with dark hair and a clean white uniform approached her table. He smiled and said,""Good morning, Nora.""Nora nodded in return and he sat down across from her.

He wore a smile like a mask. His eyes were cold and hard.

Nora stared at him for a moment, then asked,""What's your name?""""My name is Adam.""""I'm Nora. What do you do here?""Adam leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table, resting his chin in his hands.""I work in engineering. I'm an engineer.""""Oh? So what do you do?""""I fix things. You know, make them better. Fixing things is my job.""Nora frowned and shook her head. She wasn't sure if she believed him.

Adam continued,""You're a good engineer, Nora. Your equipment works well. It's just that sometimes it breaks down. That's why I'm here. To fix it.""Nora thought about this. She didn't believe him. But then again, maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he really did fix things.

She shrugged and said,""Well, thanks. I guess.""Adam nodded and stood up.""See you later, Nora. Have a nice day.""He walked away.

Nora watched him go. Then she turned back to her breakfast.

The colonists returned after lunch, but Nora had already finished eating and left. She didn't want to be the last one here.

After dinner, Nora went to the gym. The colony's gym was an enormous room filled with exercise machines and free weights. Nora worked out for a while, then showered and changed into her work clothes before heading to engineering.

Nora entered the command center and saw Sully sitting at his desk. He looked up from his computer screen.""Hey, Nora. How'd your shift go?""""It was okay.""""That's good. You look tired. Want some coffee? I've got a fresh pot.""Nora nodded and sat down in front of Sully's desk. She sipped the hot liquid gratefully, then set the cup aside.""I'm going to head home now. I'll see you tomorrow, right?""Sully nodded and smiled.""Sure. See ya.""Nora stood up and walked toward the door.

Nora walked briskly down the hall, passing the dormitories on either side of her. She passed a few colonists in various states of dress, but none were awake yet. Most people slept until after the sun rose.

She reached the end of the hallway and turned left toward the cafeteria. As she rounded the corner, Nora saw the cafeteria's doors open onto a large, empty space. A long table filled the center of the room, surrounded by benches and chairs.

Nora entered the cafeteria. She paused at the entrance, looking around for signs of life. No one else was here.

The tables were bare except for a single chair at each one. Nora took a seat at the nearest table and waited.

A minute later, a young man with dark hair and a lean build came through the door from the kitchen. He wore a white chef's uniform.

""Good morning,"" he said cheerfully. ""I'm Chef Marnie.""

Nora nodded. ""Morning, Chef.""

Chef Marnie smiled. ""You're new, aren't you?""

""Yes, I am. My name is Nora Decker. I just started today.""

Marnie gave her a friendly smile. ""Welcome. I'll be serving breakfast in about ten minutes. Would you like anything special?""

Nora shook her head. ""No, thank you. Just coffee would be fine.""

""Very good. Enjoy your meal.""

Nora sat back and watched the kitchen staff work. They moved efficiently, but with a certain amount of nervousness. The colonists had been warned about the dangers of the planet, but they still didn't know what kind of creatures lurked in the darkness beyond the colony walls.

The colonists were used to working together, but this was their first time living on a remote world without any other humans nearby. It made them edgy.

Nora's stomach rumbled. She'd skipped breakfast, and now her hunger gnawed at her.

She stood up and walked over to the counter where a small refrigerator hummed quietly. Nora opened it and pulled out a carton of orange juice. She poured herself a glass, then took a sip.

""That's not bad,"" Nora said with surprise. ""I thought I was going to have to drink water.""

The kitchen staff looked up from their tasks. One of them smiled. ""It's an old recipe we've been saving for emergencies. We don't get much fresh fruit or vegetables here, so we make do with what we can find.""

Nora nodded. ""Well, if you ever run out of oranges, let me know. I'll bring some back.""

""We appreciate it. Thank you.""

Nora left the cafeteria and headed down the corridor toward her work station. The corridors were dimly lit, but she could see well enough to navigate.

Nora walked past the rows of dark rooms until she reached the kitchen. She opened the door and entered the room. A young woman in a blue jumpsuit sat at a table, eating a bowl of cereal.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm sorry I'm late.""

The other girl looked up from her bowl. Her hair was short and blond, with a streak of red that ran through it like a river. She had green eyes and freckles across her nose.

""You're not late,"" the girl replied, setting down her spoon. She wiped her mouth with a napkin and stood. ""I've been here since six o'clock this morning. You can eat if you want.""

Nora nodded. She took the seat opposite the girl and picked up her own spoon. The girl's name was Shauna, but Nora didn't know why. Shauna seemed too young for the job.

Shauna returned to her breakfast. Nora tried to ignore the way the other girl's movements were so precise and efficient. She ate quickly and efficiently, almost mechanically.

Nora finished first. She pushed back her chair and stood. ""Thanks,"" she said. ""I'll see you later.""

""Sure thing. Have a good shift.""

Nora left the room and walked down the hallway. The colonists'quarters were arranged in a series of long, narrow rooms that ran parallel to each other along one side of the building. Each room was about ten meters wide and twenty meters deep. A row of doors lined the far wall, where the hall ended at a small kitchenette.

The corridor Nora entered was dimly lit and empty. She stepped into the room and closed the door behind her. It clicked shut with a heavy thud.

Nora exhaled slowly, trying to calm her racing heart. Her eyes darted around the dark room, searching for something to focus on. The walls were bare and featureless. There were no windows or decorations.

She felt exposed and vulnerable. She couldn't see anything.

Nora took a few steps forward, then stopped. She turned to face the door again and put her hand on it. She pressed her ear to the cold metal surface, listening intently.

Nothing. No sound came through the thick steel.

Nora let out a slow breath. She was alone in this room.

Nora walked to the center of the room, where a single light fixture hung from the ceiling. She reached up and touched the switch. The bulb flickered on, illuminating the space with a soft yellow glow.

The room was small but well designed. The floor was made of smooth gray concrete, and the walls were painted a dull green. A metal table sat in the middle of the room. On top of it rested an old digital clock.

Nora picked up the clock and examined it. It had been manufactured a century ago, when technology was still primitive. The device was heavy and clunky. Nora set it back down and looked around again.

She checked her watch. She'd been here for almost two hours already.

She stopped at the end of each hall to check the time on her wristwatch. After five minutes, she reached the cafeteria. The door was open, but no one was inside. A few tables were scattered about, but the room was empty except for Nora.

Nora sighed in relief. She had been worried that the colonists wouldn't be awake yet, but it seemed they were already eating breakfast.

The cafeteria was small, with a long line of tables and chairs. At the far end, the cooks stood behind the counter, taking orders. Nora waved to them as she passed. They nodded back.

""Good morning,"" said a voice from behind her.

Nora turned around in surprise. ""You're up early.""

A man wearing a crisp white uniform smiled at her. He held out his hand. ""I'm Captain Kincaid. I'll be your supervisor today.""

Nora shook his hand and returned the smile. She was surprised to find him so young. ""Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Nora Decker. You can call me Nora. Everyone does.""

""Very good, Nora. I'll see you at the start of shift. Don't forget to bring your work tablet.""

Nora nodded. ""Yes, sir.""

Captain Kincaid left the cafeteria. Nora watched him go, then turned back toward her table. She took a seat and waited for the cook to finish serving breakfast.

The food was hot, but not too spicy. Nora ate quickly, finishing before the other colonists arrived. She washed down each bite with a swig of water from a plastic cup.

Nora finished her meal and pushed her plate away. The cooks had already cleared the tables and were busying themselves in another part of the cafeteria. Nora stood up and stretched.

She walked over to the exit, which opened into the courtyard beyond. It was a large space, surrounded on three sides by buildings. A few people sat at the benches scattered about, reading or talking.

Nora stepped outside and looked around. She was alone.

""Hello?"" she called out. ""Anybody here?""

The colonists didn't answer. Nora frowned, wondering if they'd gone back to sleep. But no, the cafeteria door opened again and a group of people came through it. Nora recognized them from the night before.

She smiled at the sight of the women and men who made up her work crew. They were dressed in their usual clothes—the same ones Nora wore herself.

Nora waved to the workers, who returned the gesture. As the colonists passed her table, one of them stopped and spoke. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora nodded. ""Morning, Jules. How's your arm?""

Jules held up his right hand and wiggled the fingers. ""It hurts like hell, but I'll be fine. Thanks for asking.""

""You're welcome,"" Nora said. She turned back toward the cafeteria.

A man in a white uniform approached her.

42,0.3,0.9,"The halls were quiet this early in the morning. The colonists slept late, but they still needed to be up and about. Nora walked quickly through the dormitories, past the communal showers, and toward the cafeteria. She passed a few people working on their own projects, but most of the colonists were already at work.

The cafeteria was empty except for one woman sitting alone at a table near the back. Nora recognized her from the night before as a young engineer named Lianna. Nora stopped to talk to her, but Lianna didn't look up. Her eyes were fixed on the tabletop, where she was drawing something with a stylus.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""I'm sorry I missed your party last night.""

Lianna looked up, her face pale and drawn. She blinked rapidly, then nodded stiffly. ""No problem.""

Nora sat across from her. ""Are you okay?""

""Yeah, just tired.""

""You don't have to go if you're not feeling well.""

Lianna shook her head. ""It's fine. I'll be fine. It's just been a rough couple of days.""

Nora didn't know what to say. She was too busy trying to figure out how to get through the day without being eaten alive.

""How are things going with Sully?"" Lianna asked, changing the subject.

""He's good,"" Nora said. ""We've got a lot of work to do today.""

""That's great. I'm glad he's doing so well.""

""Me, too,"" Nora agreed. She paused for a moment, then added, ""I think he likes me.""

""Well, I'm sure he does."" Lianna smiled faintly. ""He's very nice.""

Nora felt a twinge of jealousy. She'd never had anyone like Sully before. He was kind and smart, with an easy smile and an infectious laugh. Nora liked him a lot.

She took a deep breath. ""I'll see you later,"" she said.

Lianna nodded, then returned to her drawing.

Nora left the cafeteria and headed back toward the dormitories. She passed a few people working on their own projects. Most of the colonists were already at work.

Nora walked past the communal showers, where the steamy mist hung heavy over the floor. The air was thick with the smell of wet metal and soap.

The corridors were dimly lit, but Nora could still make out the outlines of the colonists'bodies under the sheets. She saw a man sleeping soundly, his head resting on the pillow beside a woman curled up in a fetal position. A young girl slept alone, her arms wrapped around a stuffed animal.

Nora stopped to look at them for a moment. She wondered what they were dreaming about. What did they think of when they closed their eyes?

She shook herself and continued walking.

Her quarters were near the end of the hall. Nora stepped inside, shut the door, then leaned back against it. Her room was small and cramped, with a narrow bed tucked into one corner and a desk in the other. There wasn't much furniture aside from a chair and a table.

Nora sighed, then sat down at her desk. She pulled out a notepad and began to write.

To my dearest Sully,

I hope this letter finds you well.

43,0.3,0.9,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each one a single room for a single person. A few colonists sat in the hallways, their heads bowed over tablet computers. Others stood at the sinks to wash up after breakfast.

Nora walked past the rows of rooms, feeling the cold air on her face as she passed the doorways. The colony's architecture was designed to be efficient but not spacious. Each room had a small desk, chair, and bed. Most people slept alone.

Nora paused at the end of the hallway to check her wristwatch. She'd been working late again, and it was already midmorning. Her stomach grumbled in anticipation of food.

She turned right, heading for the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was located on the opposite side of the main concourse from the dormitories. It was a large open space with a long counter and tables that seated several dozen people. The tables were made of metal plates bolted together. They were sturdy, but they weren't meant for comfort.

Nora stepped inside the cavernous room, which was dimly lit by emergency lighting. She saw a few colonists sitting at the tables, eating breakfast. Most of them glanced up at her entrance, then returned to their meals.

Nora took a seat at one of the empty tables. The cafeteria was filled with an assortment of smells and sounds. A woman in the corner was loudly complaining about her meal. Another man was laughing at something his friend said. A young girl sat alone reading a book, and a couple of men played cards.

Nora looked around the room, noticing the people who didn't seem to be talking or eating. She wondered what they did here.

The cafeteria was quiet. No one spoke. Everyone seemed preoccupied with their own thoughts.

Nora's stomach rumbled again, and she realized she hadn't eaten since breakfast. She ordered a bowl of cereal from the automated dispenser and ate it standing at the counter while she waited for her food.

She finished her meal quickly, then walked out into the corridor. The clock on the wall read 10: 30 AM. She'd been working late again.

Nora turned right, heading toward the dormitories. As she passed the cafeteria, a man in a dark suit appeared at the end of the hallway. He stood there for a moment, watching her go.

Nora felt her heart skip a beat. Her pulse quickened. She stopped walking and stared at him.

The man was tall, with black hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His eyes were dark brown and intense, and he wore an expensive-looking suit. He wasn't a Company employee; he was a stranger.

He watched Nora until she moved away from the cafeteria. Then he stepped back into the shadows of the hall and disappeared.

Nora's mind raced. She couldn't believe her eyes. The man had just been standing in the hallway, but now he was gone.

She shook her head and tried to convince herself she must have imagined it. But she knew what she saw. The man had been real.

44,0.3,0.9,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights spaced every few meters along the walls. The air smelled stale, but not unpleasant. A few colonists walked past her in their pajamas, yawning and rubbing eyes.

Nora paused at the end of the corridor to check her watch. She was almost late.

She turned right and headed toward the cafeteria. The hallways were lined with doors leading to the dormitories, labs, and other facilities. Nora passed several closed doors. As she approached the cafeteria, the chirping alarm sounded again.

Nora sighed. She hated this part of her job. It was always the same. She had to walk through the halls, checking each door in turn. If the alarm went off, she would have to go back and check the rooms. That meant going down the hallway again.

It was a long, tedious process. And it got worse when the alarms went off frequently.

Nora shook her head. She didn't want to think about the problem. She needed to focus on something else. Something more pleasant. Like breakfast.

The cafeteria was located at the end of the main corridor. It was a large room with long tables and benches, where colonists ate meals together. The space was brightened by overhead fluorescent lights and white walls decorated with colorful posters of planets and starships.

Nora entered the cafeteria and spotted her friend, Dr. Chen, sitting alone at one of the tables. She waved to get the doctor's attention.

Dr. Rowena Chen smiled and nodded. She was an attractive woman in her mid-thirties with dark hair pulled into a tight bun. Her eyes were intelligent, but her face showed signs of stress. She wore a lab coat over her nightclothes and carried a clipboard in her hand.

""Good morning, Nora,"" she said. ""I hope you slept well.""

Nora shrugged. ""Not really.""

""What do you mean?"" asked the doctor. ""You're always so cheerful. I'm sure you had a good time last night.""

Nora grinned. ""That's not what I meant. It was just... hard work. And I was tired.""

Rowena looked at her with concern. ""Are you okay? You look pale.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, it's nothing. Just a little tired. But I'll be fine. I've been working too much lately. I need some sleep. That's why I came down here early.""

The doctor nodded. ""I understand. Well, let me know if anything comes up. We'll have to get together soon for a progress report.""

Nora nodded and walked away from the table. She passed several colonists eating breakfast and headed toward the cafeteria's exit.

She paused at the door and glanced back. Dr. Chen was still sitting alone at her table, looking very serious. Nora felt a pang of guilt. Her friend seemed so sad.

Nora sighed and turned away.

It took only ten minutes to walk the length of the colony. She checked each room in turn before returning to the cafeteria. The alarm sounded again.

Nora groaned. She hated this part. It was always the same.

45,0.3,0.9,"The colony's main hall was empty except for a few colonists heading to the mess hall. The halls were dimly lit, but the lights glowed brightly enough to illuminate the way.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria where she could grab a quick meal and then head back to her lab. Her boots clacked loudly on the metal grating covering the walkways, echoing off the walls of the corridors.

The air was dry and cold, but Nora didn't mind. She had grown up in the desert. She knew how to dress for the climate.

She passed the command center, which was dark and silent. A lone guard stood at attention outside the door, his rifle slung over one shoulder.

Nora nodded to him as she passed, but he gave no response. He just stared straight ahead with eyes that seemed to be staring through her.

Ahead, the mess hall was a large room filled with tables and chairs. The tables were covered in long metal trays and the chairs were bolted to the floor. The tables were crowded with colonists who were already eating breakfast.

Nora walked past them, shoving her way into the line. She grabbed a tray and a cup of coffee from the dispenser before sitting down.

The food was good. It smelled fresh and hot. But Nora didn't have time to enjoy it. She gulped the coffee and shoved her plate away.

She was halfway through her second cup when a drone appeared out of nowhere and landed on the table next to her. The drone was about the size of a small dog, but its body was sleek and sinuous like an insect's. Its carapace was black, shiny, and smooth. Its head was flat, featureless, and round with two glowing red eyes.

Nora froze. Her heart pounded in her chest as she stared at the creature. She tried to stand, but the chair was bolted down.

The drone cocked its head and regarded Nora with its strange eyes. Then it spoke in a voice that sounded like the rustling of dry leaves.

""You are not a native.""

Nora couldn't move or speak. The drone was speaking English, but the words were distorted and guttural.

""Are you human?"" the drone asked.

Nora nodded dumbly.

The drone stood up and walked toward her. Nora watched it warily. She could smell something foul in the air around it.

It reached out a clawed hand and grabbed her wrist. Nora screamed. The drone pulled her to her feet with one powerful tug. It held her arm out straight, so that her forearm was parallel to the floor.

""What is your name?"" the drone demanded.

Nora stared at its face. ""My name? I'm...""

She wasn't sure what to say. She had never met anyone like this before. The drone's expressionless face seemed to be staring right through her.

The drone let go of Nora's arm and stepped back. It turned away from her, then looked back at her with its red eyes.

""I am called the Master,"" it said. ""We will meet again soon.""

The colony's power plant was located in the center of the complex, near the garage and engineering bays. Nora walked past the dormitories, heading toward the command center. She passed several other colonists who were already up and about. They nodded to Nora as she passed them.

Nora's boots clacked on the metal flooring, echoing through the corridors. She reached the command center without incident.

Valentina Kern was standing at the entrance to the command center. Valentina wore a dark blue uniform with gold trim. Her long black hair hung loose around her shoulders, and her face was pale and drawn. She looked tired but alert.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm glad you're awake.""

Valentina smiled thinly, her eyes darting nervously. ""Yes, I am. Thank you, Nora. Good morning, everyone.""

Nora nodded back. ""Morning. Is everything okay?""

""No,"" Valentina answered. ""We've got a problem. A big one. We need your help. Please come with me.""

Nora followed Valentina into the command center. The room was large and well lit by banks of monitors and screens. There were no windows, just an array of consoles and workstations.

A small group of colonists stood around the central console, talking in hushed tones. They turned to look at Nora as she entered.

Valentina gestured to the others and they stepped aside. She led Nora over to the console and motioned for her to sit down.

Nora sat down and watched Valentina study the monitor displays. The woman's fingers moved quickly across the keyboard, typing commands into the system.

""What is it?"" Nora asked. ""Is everything okay?""

Valentina shook her head. ""No. Everything isn't okay. I think we're under attack.""

Nora frowned. ""By who? What do you mean?""

""I don't know,"" Valentina answered. ""But the drones are here.""

The colonists murmured among themselves, their faces grim and pale.

Nora looked at Valentina. ""Drones?""

Valentina nodded. ""Yes. We've been attacked by a swarm of drones. They're hiding underground, but they're coming up through the vents and tunnels in the rock.""

""How many?"" Nora asked.

""We can't tell,"" Valentina answered. ""There could be hundreds or thousands. I'm not sure how they got past our security systems. The drones have no physical bodies, so they must have some kind of cloaking technology to hide from radar. Our sensors aren't picking them up. And there's something else. They're intelligent. They communicate with each other. Some of the drones are communicating with us.""

Nora frowned. ""Are you saying they're talking?""

""No, not exactly. It's more like a hive mind. The drones are communicating with each other and then relaying information back to the colony. We've recorded several conversations.

Nora followed the smell to the cafeteria where she found the other members of her team already gathered around the long tables. They sat at one end of the room, eating eggs and bacon while they waited for the food to be served.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted them as she took a seat at the table.

""Morning.""

""I see you're up early today. Did the alarm wake you?""

""Yeah, I just got out of bed. I'm starving.""

Nora grinned. ""Me too. Let's eat.""

The meal was simple but filling. Nora ate quickly, then excused herself from the table to go back to her quarters. She wanted to get a shower and change into more comfortable clothes before starting work.

She paused in front of the mirror, checking her appearance. Her dark hair had been pulled back into a ponytail and secured with a rubber band, leaving her face bare. A few strands fell across her eyes, but she didn't bother trying to push them aside.

Her green eyes were bright and alert, and her skin was pale and clear. Nora looked like she belonged here.

Nora turned away from the mirror and headed for the showers. She needed to wash off the sweat of her shift before she started working on the next problem.

The shower felt good. Nora scrubbed the grime and dust from her body with a rough brush, rinsing it down with warm water until the last traces of grit disappeared. Then she stepped out into the steamy room and toweled dry.

Nora dressed in clean clothes, then went to the kitchen to grab a breakfast bar from the dispenser. She took her time eating while she watched the other colonists come and go.

When she finished, Nora walked back to the cafeteria to find most of her team already gone. The only ones left were the two engineers who had been assigned to help her.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted them as she sat at one end of the table.

""Morning.""

The two men nodded to her, then returned to their food. Nora ate in silence, watching them. She wasn't sure what she was looking for.

It didn't take long before the engineer on her right spoke up. ""So how are we doing?""

Nora blinked. She hadn't expected him to ask. ""We're fine. We've got a few problems, but nothing too serious.""

The man nodded and glanced over his shoulder. His companion had already finished eating and stood up. He was tall and lean with dark hair and eyes.

""I'll see you later,"" he said.

Nora watched him leave, then turned back to her meal.

She finished eating quickly and walked back to the cafeteria, where she found the other engineer sitting alone at the table. She sat down across from him.

It wasn't long until the first person ahead of her got their meal. A young woman in a blue jumpsuit with short, spiky hair took a tray from the serving robot and sat down at one of the tables. Nora watched her eat.

She looked like a teenager. Maybe younger than Nora. But she ate quickly with efficient movements, pausing only to take small sips of water. She didn't seem to notice the other patrons watching her.

Nora glanced around, but no one seemed to be paying attention to her. She was just another face in the crowd. She turned back to watch the girl.

The girl finished eating and pushed the tray away. Her eyes flicked toward Nora, then away again. She stood up without a word and left.

Nora stared after her for a moment, then shrugged. It was probably nothing.

She picked up her tray and continued on to the cafeteria's kitchen. The food smelled good.

The kitchen was a large room with a high ceiling, filled with long stainless steel counters and racks of shelves holding pots, pans, and utensils. A row of industrial ovens lined one wall, while a bank of refrigerators and freezers occupied the opposite side.

Ahead of Nora, a line of colonists waited in front of a serving robot. She joined them, taking her tray and placing it on the conveyor belt.

""Good morning,"" said a man behind her. He wore an engineer's uniform with a white shirt, black pants, and boots. His hair was dark brown and curly.

Nora turned to look at him. ""Morning.""

He smiled. ""I'm Sully Carmichael. I work in the power plant.""

She nodded. ""Nora Decker. I'm an engineer.""

Sully held out his hand. Nora shook it.

""You're a mechanic?"" he asked.

""Yeah. My specialty is repairing machinery. But I've also worked on the power plants before.""

""That's good."" He gestured toward the serving robot. ""Grab some food and come with me. We'll talk about your shift.""

Nora followed him into a small office near the cafeteria. The walls were covered in charts and graphs, while a large window looked out over the colony grounds.

Sully sat down behind a desk. Nora took a seat across from him.

""So what's the deal with this shift?"" Sully asked.

""Well..."" Nora hesitated. She wasn't sure how much to tell him. ""It's not my fault.""

""What isn't? Your equipment malfunctioning?""

She shrugged. ""No. Well, yes. But it's not just the equipment.""

Sully raised an eyebrow. ""Go on.""

Nora sighed and rubbed her eyes. ""The drones are coming for us.""

The walls were lined with doors leading to other parts of the colony. Nora walked past the dormitories on one side, then turned right at the end of the hall. She passed a small rec room where colonists gathered to play games, read, or watch holovids.

Ahead was the cafeteria, which was open for business. Nora entered the room through the door marked 'Employees Only'. A long counter ran along the back wall with several stools. At the front was a serving line that led to tables and chairs. There were no customers yet, so she took a seat in a booth near the back of the room and waited.

The food was good, but it wasn't worth missing her shift. Nora ate quickly, washing down the last bite with a swig from a bottle of water. She left the table and headed back toward the dormitory wing.

Nora paused at the entrance to the hallway and looked around. She could hear voices coming from the rec room, and wondered if anyone else had been up late working on their projects.

She stepped inside and saw a few people sitting in the corner. One of them was talking with a tall woman wearing a black uniform. Nora recognized her as one of the Company representatives who visited the colony once every month or two to check on progress. The representative wore glasses, and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun.

The other colonists were silent. They sat at the tables with their heads bowed. Nora walked over to the table where the representative was seated. She was a middle aged man, his face thin and lined. He was speaking with a young woman in a white lab coat.

""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""We're running behind schedule.""

The young woman nodded, her expression grim. Nora recognized her from the cafeteria. She was a scientist named Dr. Chen.

""You'll be finished soon,"" the man assured her. ""Just give us another day or two and we can get you back on track.""

Dr. Chen shook her head. ""That's not good enough. We need to finish this project today.""

The man frowned. ""What do you mean? You've already completed your work for the month. We have more than enough supplies to last until next month.""

Nora stepped forward. She didn't like the way the conversation was going, but it was too late now.

""I don't think so,"" Nora said. ""I'm an engineer. I know how much time and resources go into a project. If you want to keep working on this, you'll have to start from scratch.""

The man and the woman looked at each other. The representative spoke first. ""Are you sure?""

""Yes,"" Nora replied. ""I'm positive.""

The man sighed. ""Very well. We'll begin again from the beginning. But if we run out of materials, you'll have to find some elsewhere.""

""Of course,"" Nora said. ""Thank you.""

She turned and walked away. As she did, the representative called after her. ""I'm sorry about this.""

She entered the room, which was filled with long tables. A few people sat around eating their breakfasts. Nora grabbed a tray from the stack beside the door, filling it with food. She took her seat at the table farthest from the door, and began to eat.

The cafeteria was quiet. Nora ate quickly, trying not to think about the work ahead of her. She finished her meal, washed it down with a swig of water from a nearby dispenser, and stood up.

Nora left the cafeteria, walking back toward the dormitory wing. The corridor was dim, lit only by the faint glow of the emergency lighting. She passed several doors, each marked with a number.

Nora stopped in front of one door. It had no name or number, just an engraved plate that read: VALENTINA KERN.

It was the commander's quarters.

Nora hesitated, then knocked on the door. There was no answer. She tried again, harder this time, and still there was nothing.

She turned away, walking briskly back down the hall. The alarm was still sounding in her ear.

The dormitories were empty when Nora arrived. She walked into the first one, where a row of beds stretched along the wall. Nora sat at the end of the bed farthest from the door and waited for the alarm to stop.

When it did, Nora rose, stretching her arms over her head. She looked around the room, then pulled a small device from her pocket. It was a tiny black box with a screen and two buttons. She pressed the button on top, which made the screen light up.

The screen displayed a list of names. Nora scrolled down to find Valentina Kern's name. She tapped the screen, and the device beeped once.

Nora opened the door. The hallway was dark, but the emergency lighting glowed faintly in the distance. She stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind her.

Nora walked briskly down the hall, past the dormitories and toward the cafeteria. The alarm was still sounding, but it wasn't so loud now. Nora paused at the doorway, listening for any sound from inside.

The colonists slept late, so there was no one around to bother her. She walked briskly toward the mess hall, hoping the food would be hot.

She passed a few other people on their way to the mess hall, but they didn't acknowledge her presence. Nora wasn't used to being ignored. Her parents had always been kind to her, and she'd grown up with friends and neighbors. She felt like an outsider here.

Ahead of her, the mess hall was dark. A single red emergency exit sign glowed at the end of the hallway. Nora paused in front of it, then turned back to look behind her. She couldn't see anyone else in the hallway, but she could hear voices coming from somewhere ahead of her. She frowned and started walking again.

The voices grew louder as she approached. They sounded angry. As she rounded the corner, Nora saw a group of people gathered in the middle of the corridor. One man stood in the center, his face flushed, while two women in lab coats scowled at him. Another woman in a white coat stood beside them with her arms folded across her chest.

Nora stopped and stared. The three scientists were arguing about something, but the man was shouting over them. He looked furious. Nora's eyes widened. She recognized him.

""You can't just leave me here!"" he shouted, pointing at one of the scientists. ""I'm a qualified engineer! I know my job.""

The other scientist shook her head and spoke in a low voice, but Nora couldn't make out what she said. She stepped closer to listen.

""We're not leaving you here,"" the first scientist snapped. ""But we need someone who knows how to fix this equipment. You don't. We'll send for another engineer when we get back to the Company.""

""No, no, no!"" the man yelled. ""I won't be left behind. I've got a family. They'll starve without me. This is my home. I'm an engineer. I should be on the bridge of a ship. Not stuck in some godforsaken colony like this. Do you understand?""

The other scientists exchanged glances, then both nodded. Nora watched the man's face grow pale and his jaw clench. He turned and stormed away down the corridor. The two scientists followed after him, their footsteps echoing loudly as they walked past Nora.

Nora stared at them in shock. She'd never seen the man before in her life. But he was clearly one of the colonists, and she knew everyone here. She had to do something.

She started running after the men. As she ran, she realized the other scientists were still following after the man. She glanced back to see the third scientist standing with arms crossed, watching Nora run.

52,0.3,0.9,"The colony's main hall was filled with colonists milling about in their work clothes. The hallways were lined with doors leading to the various dormitories. At the end of each hallway, a set of stairs led up to the command center at the top of the building.

As Nora walked past the communal showers, she saw several people already waiting for the water to heat up. She shook her head and continued on. By the time she reached the cafeteria, she was late for breakfast.

The cafeteria was just as crowded as the rest of the colony. Nora took a seat near the front where she could see the line forming. She waited patiently until her turn came, then made her way to the serving counter.

""What can I get you?"" the young woman behind the counter asked as Nora approached.

Nora glanced around the room, looking for familiar faces. ""I'm supposed to be working today,"" she said.

The girl smiled sympathetically. ""You're not the first one this week.""

""How many have quit already?"" Nora asked.

""Two more. They didn't last long.""

Nora sighed. She'd been hoping to avoid the job, but it seemed like no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't escape it.

The girl handed Nora a tray and pointed toward the back of the room. ""There's an empty table over there.""

Nora nodded, then walked to the indicated spot. She sat down and began piling food onto her plate. The cafeteria was noisy, with people talking loudly in groups or alone while they ate. Nora listened for any hint of conversation about the drones, but heard nothing.

She finished her meal quickly, then picked up her tray and headed out. As she passed the serving counter, the girl called after her. ""See you later!""

Nora waved without turning around. She stepped outside into the cool morning air and looked around. Her eyes immediately fell on the nearby cliffs, which rose above the colony like a wall.

The fog had lifted, allowing Nora to see the landscape beyond. It was rugged and desolate. She walked along the edge of the cliff as far as she could go before the drop became too steep to climb down. Far below, the ground dropped off sharply. Nora could make out the jagged rocks and boulders at the bottom.

Nora turned away from the precipice, then stopped abruptly. A figure stood just inside the entrance to the cafeteria. He was tall and lean with dark hair and a sharp chin. His face was angular, with high cheekbones and strong jawline. His skin was pale, almost colorless, but his eyes were bright green.

Nora stared at him in shock for several seconds, then she realized he wasn't human. The man's head and shoulders were covered with a thick, black fur.

He was wearing a long coat and matching pants. Nora recognized the outfit as military camouflage. But there was something odd about it. The fabric seemed to be made of some kind of synthetic material, yet it felt like real cloth.

53,0.3,0.9,"The dormitory hallways were dimly lit by the faint glow of emergency lights. The colonists'breathing echoed in the quiet, but Nora heard nothing else. No alarms sounded.

She walked along the hallway to the communal showers at the end of the hall. As she approached, a soft blue glow shone from within the room. A few other colonists stood around the open door.

Nora hesitated, then entered the small room. Inside, three men and two women waited for her. They wore the same clothes as Nora.

""Good morning,"" said one of the men. ""I'm Sergeant Kowalski."" He was tall, dark haired, and handsome, with a square jaw and strong chin. His eyes were brown, his skin pale, and he had a scar across the left side of his face.

Nora nodded to him politely. ""Morning, Sergeant.""

The others in the room greeted her in turn. One of the women, a short, plump brunette named Sarah, smiled at Nora.

""You're up early,"" she said.

""Yeah, I've got an hour before my shift starts. I thought I'd take advantage of it.""

Sarah's smile faded. ""Oh. Well, good luck with that. We're going to have a busy day. You'll be working with me and Lieutenant Kern today. And we need to get started on those repairs. The colony is suffering from power outages again.""

""Power outage?"" Nora asked. ""What happened?""

Sarah shrugged. ""We don't know. It just happens every few days. Sometimes the lights go off for hours at a time, sometimes only for minutes. But when they come back on, everything seems fine. We haven't been able to figure out what causes them.""

""Maybe you should call the Company,"" Nora suggested. ""They can send someone down here to check things out.""

""I did. They told us to keep doing our jobs and wait until they could send a repair team. So we're waiting.""

Nora frowned. ""That doesn't make sense. Why would they tell you to do something like that? Wouldn't they want to fix the problem right away?""

Sarah shook her head. ""Not if it's a safety issue. If there's an emergency, they'll send a rescue ship or some kind of transport to pick up everyone who needs help.""

""But..."" Nora trailed off. She couldn't think of anything else to say.

Sarah sighed. ""Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. We're just frustrated. And we've been getting more and more power outages lately. It's really starting to wear on us.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, I understand.""

""So how long have you worked here?"" Sarah asked. ""How long has this colony been established?""

""About five years,"" Nora answered.

""Five years!"" Sarah exclaimed. ""Wow. That's incredible. You must be one of the first colonists.""

Nora shrugged. ""I guess so. I don't know much about it. My dad was a prospector before he died. He left me his share of the company stock, and I moved here to start my own business. But when I got here, everything was already set up. The Company had been running things for a while.""

""You're lucky,"" Sarah said.

54,0.3,0.9,"The colony's main hall was filled with colonists going about their morning routines. The air smelled like stale coffee, sweat, and the lingering scent of last night's dinner. A few people glanced up at her, but most ignored her as they went about their business.

Nora walked past the cafeteria where she could smell the aroma of fresh baked bread and meat pies. She passed a small shop selling foodstuffs, clothing, and other necessities to the colonists. She paused to look in the window, admiring the colorful displays.

The Company was good at marketing.

She continued on toward the command center, passing rows of offices and labs. She stopped outside one door labeled 'Engineering'. Nora knocked.

""Come in,"" came the gruff voice from inside.

Nora opened the door to find Sully Carmichael sitting behind a large desk. He was a big man with a broad face and a thick shock of dark hair. His eyes were a deep brown and he had a strong jawline.

Sully looked up when Nora entered, his eyes widening in surprise. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning, sir,"" Nora replied. She glanced around the room, taking it in. It was dimly lit with only two lamps on the table beside Sully's chair. The walls were bare metal and the ceiling was low and exposed. There was a single window at the far end of the room, which let in little light.

The room felt cold and unwelcoming, but Nora knew better than to complain. She was grateful for the job.

Nora sat down across from Sully at the table. ""I'm glad I caught you, sir,"" she said.

""What can I do for you?"" Sully asked. He leaned back in his chair and folded his hands on top of the desk. Nora noticed the large scar on his right hand.

""I've been having trouble with my equipment. The lights keep flickering and the heaters won't turn off.""

Sully nodded. ""It's probably a power surge. We get them sometimes. You'll have to wait until we get more parts in.""

Nora frowned, not liking the sound of that. ""But the Company is supposed to be sending us new parts every week!""

""We're running low on some components,"" Sully replied. ""That's why they sent me here. I'll see what I can do about getting you a replacement part.""

Nora bit her lip, frustrated. She hated waiting for things to work out. But if the colonists didn't have enough supplies, then there was nothing she could do about it.

Sully stood up and walked around his desk. ""You'll need to go down to the garage and pick up your replacement part,"" he said. ""I'll give you directions when you leave.""

""Yes, sir,"" Nora replied. She got up from the table and headed for the door.

As she passed Sully's desk, she glanced at his computer screen. It was a large flat panel display with a touch interface. The screen showed a map of the colony and several blinking red dots indicating the location of malfunctions.

55,0.3,0.9,"The hallways were dimly lit by flickering emergency lights, but the colonists had long since learned to stay alert even when the power failed. The constant hum of machinery was quiet in the predawn hours. Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, where she could grab a quick meal and then get back to work.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables, chairs, and benches. A few colonists sat at the tables, eating their breakfasts, while others stood around chatting. Nora took her tray to one of the empty seats near the front of the room.

A tall man with dark hair and a lean face approached her as she waited for her food. He smiled warmly, but his eyes were hard and cold.""Good morning, Nora,""he said.""I'm Commander Valentina Kern.""""Valentina?""Nora asked.""That's your name? I thought it was Decker.""""It is,""she replied.""But you're not a commander yet. You'll be promoted to that rank once you've completed your training.""She nodded, accepting the explanation without further comment.""You're new here, aren't you?""""Yes,""Nora said, glancing over her shoulder at the other colonists. They were all staring at her.""How did you know that?""""Everyone knows who you are,""the man said.""Your record shows up on our screens every time we have an alert. And everyone in this colony has heard about the attack last night.""He paused, watching Nora closely.""I can tell by the way you look at me. You don't seem surprised to see me.""Nora shrugged uncomfortably. She didn't like being singled out, but she wasn't going to let him intimidate her.

The man laughed softly.""Don't worry. I'm not trying to pick a fight. It's just that I wanted to talk to you before you start work. I need some help with my security team.""Nora blinked. Security team? What was he talking about?""What do you mean, 'security team?'""She asked.""I'm in charge of the entire colony,""he explained.""And I want to make sure I have enough people working for me. My primary responsibility is keeping the colonists safe. But I also need to keep an eye on the Company's interests. That means making sure no one gets too close to our secrets.""""Secrets?""Nora asked.""Like what?""""I'll show you.""He turned and walked away, leaving Nora alone.

Nora stared after the man, confused. He was a Company executive? How could someone from the Company be assigned to guard the colonists? The Company had its own security force. Why would they assign an outsider?

She shook her head, annoyed. She'd been so tired last night that she hadn't even thought about it. Now, though, she realized that Valentina Kern must have been sent here to spy on the colony.

Valentina Kern was a Company executive. A spy. And she was in charge of security.

Nora got up and left her seat. She needed to find out more.

The corridors were dark and empty. Nora hurried toward the command center, where she hoped to find Valentina. She passed through the main hallways and entered the elevator.

56,0.3,0.9,"The dormitory hallways were quiet this early in the morning. The colonists slept late, but they still had to get up for work. At least the corridors weren't crowded.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway, past a few other doors until she reached the end where the communal bathrooms were located. She opened the door to find it empty except for the faint smell of cleaning solution and steam from the showers. Nora sighed with relief at the sight of the large, modern bathroom.

She stripped off her clothes and hung them on hooks beside the door, then turned on the water to fill the tub. As soon as the hot water filled the room, Nora stepped into it, sighing in pleasure as the heat seeped through her body. She lathered herself with soap, scrubbing away the grime of the previous day's work.

After rinsing herself off, Nora stepped out of the bath and toweled dry. She dressed quickly in fresh clothes and headed back down the hall toward the cafeteria.

The colonists ate together in a long, narrow dining area. It was a small space, but the tables were wide enough to accommodate six people comfortably. The walls were made of glass panels, allowing sunlight to stream through the windows.

Nora sat down at a table near the window and waited for her food. She didn't have much time. Her shift started in less than an hour.

A few minutes later, a man entered the room carrying two trays. He set one tray on each side of Nora's chair and stepped away. Nora picked up her utensils and began to eat.

She was just finishing when the door opened again, admitting another man with two more trays. The first man returned to his station at the front of the room, leaving the second man standing in the doorway.

He was tall and thin, with dark hair and eyes. His skin was pale and he wore a black suit and tie. Nora recognized him as the man who had escorted her to the infirmary last night.

The man stepped inside, setting down his tray on the table next to Nora's. Then he turned to face her, leaning casually against the wall.

""Good morning,"" he said in a smooth voice. ""I'm Dr. Travin.""

Nora blinked at the man for a moment before realizing what he meant. She looked down at her plate and swallowed hard.

Her heart pounded in her chest. Her mouth went dry.

She couldn't speak.

The man smiled. ""You're new here, aren't you?""

Nora nodded, unable to look up.

""Well, I've been assigned to teach your class this semester. It's my job to make sure everyone gets along. I'll be working with you for the next few weeks, so we should get acquainted.""

He reached out and took her hand in his own. Nora jerked back reflexively. Her eyes darted around the room as if searching for an escape route.

57,0.3,0.9,"The colony's main hall was long and wide, with rows of doors lining both sides. The walls were made up of a metallic mesh, giving the place a utilitarian feel. A few colonists stood in the hall, talking quietly.

The lights overhead flickered as Nora approached. She paused at the end of one row of doors, listening to the conversation around her.

""I don't know why they keep sending us out here,"" said a man. ""We're not going to find anything.""

""You never know until you try,"" replied another. ""And we've got to eat.""

Nora frowned. She knew the two men; they worked with her on maintenance detail, and she'd seen them around the colony. They were friends, but not close.

She walked past them toward the communal showers. Her boots clacked loudly on the metal flooring. She was used to the sound now, and it didn't bother her anymore.

The communal shower room was a large chamber with rows of cubicles along both sides. The walls were lined with small, square openings that let in the morning light. The air smelled like soap. Nora stepped inside a cubicle and turned on the water.

As the hot spray hit her face, Nora sighed in relief. She scrubbed her hair vigorously, then rinsed off the suds. When the last drops ran down the drain, she toweled herself dry with a towel from the dispenser.

Nora pulled on a fresh shirt over her damp skin as she left the shower. She felt better, more awake.

The colony's kitchen was located near the main hall. It was a long, narrow room with rows of counters and tables. The walls were made up of glass panels that looked out onto the main concourse.

Nora walked through the kitchen, nodding at the other colonists who worked there. She grabbed some breakfast before heading back to her quarters.

She ate quickly, then went to the command center. The room was a large, open space with a central control panel. A few people sat around the table, eating their meals. Nora took a seat in one of the chairs.

""Good morning,"" said the woman sitting across from her.

""Morning."" Nora nodded. ""How are you?""

The woman smiled. She had a sharp face and dark brown hair cut short. Her eyes were blue, and her skin was pale.

""I'm fine. How about you?""

Nora shrugged. ""Not bad. I've been working on the power plant. It's giving me trouble again.""

The woman nodded. ""We're having problems with the fusion reactor too. We're going to have to get a new one soon.""

""That's what I hear,"" Nora replied. She glanced around the room. ""You guys work here, right? What do you do?""

The woman laughed. ""Oh, we're not engineers. We're just colonists like everyone else.""

Nora frowned. ""But... aren't you Company executives or something?""

The woman shook her head. ""No, no. We're just employees.

Nora walked briskly past the rows of doors until she reached the communal showers at the end of the hallway.

She turned the corner, then stopped short. A huge, dark shape stood in the middle of the corridor, blocking the way. Nora stared up at it, stunned.

A drone.

It was the size of a small car. Its body was covered in smooth black chitin, and its long legs ended in sharp claws. It had no head or face. Instead, two glowing red eyes glowed from within the darkness of the creature's shell.

The drone slowly lowered itself to the ground where it crouched, motionless. Nora took a step back, her heart pounding. She swallowed hard, trying to calm herself.

Nora knew what drones were capable of. They were the most dangerous creatures in the universe. And this one wasn't alone.

The colony's security system warned her with a low beeping sound. Nora glanced around the hallway, looking for another drone. There were none. But she could hear the faint sounds of movement coming from beyond the doorways.

She crept forward, peering through the doorway into an empty room. She turned and looked down the hall again, then ducked inside the next room. It was a storage closet. Nora moved quickly through the rooms, checking each one before moving on.

At the end of the hallway, she found a small kitchen. A fire blazed in the stove, warming the room. The colonists would have breakfast soon.

Nora stepped out of the kitchen and hurried along the corridor. As she passed the last door, she heard a soft hiss behind her. She spun around, but there was nothing there.

The drone stood at the end of the hall, watching her. Nora stared back, frozen. Her heart pounded in her ears.

She turned away from it, trying to ignore its presence. It was only a drone. An automated security device. Nothing more.

Nora continued walking, her steps quickening. She reached the command center, where she stopped short.

The drone had followed her.

It crouched outside the door, waiting for her. Its eyes glowed red in the dim light of the hallway. Nora felt a chill run up her spine.

She took a deep breath and opened the door. The drone didn't move. It just watched her, silent.

Nora stepped inside, then froze.

A large black mass lay sprawled across the floor in front of the door. She recognized it immediately.

The body of a drone.

Nora's heart sank. The drone had been killed, but not before it managed to kill someone else.

She stepped over the dead drone and walked into the command center. Eve sat at the main control console, monitoring the colony's systems.

""Eve,"" Nora said quietly. ""I need your help.""

Eve looked up from her work. Her face was pale, and her eyes were wide with shock.

Nora swallowed hard. ""We've got a problem.""

Nora's boots clacked on the metal grating as she strode along. Her breath puffed out white in front of her, and the air smelled stale from the recycled air system. Nora passed a few other people on their way to the showers, but they kept their distance.

She reached the end of the hallway and stopped. A row of small, square windows lined the wall opposite the door. Nora peered through them into the courtyard beyond.

The colony was built around a large open area that served as both a landing pad and a park for recreation. In the center of the yard, a fountain burbled water into a pool. The fountain had been designed to resemble a giant human face with flowing hair and a wide-brimmed hat. Nora could see the reflection of her own face in the pool.

Nora turned away from the window. She sighed again. The colonists didn't have much time for luxuries like parks or fountains, but the Company insisted on maintaining them for the benefit of its employees.

Nora stepped into the shower room and pulled off her boots. As she stripped out of her clothes, she heard a faint beeping noise from somewhere in the building. Nora frowned. She hadn't heard it before.

The sound came again, louder this time. It sounded like a warning alarm.

Nora paused as the sound grew more insistent. The colonists would hear it too if it went off. She hurriedly finished undressing and grabbed a towel.

The alarm continued to pulse. Nora wrapped the towel around herself and ran for the door. The hallway outside was empty, but she could still hear the alarm.

Nora sprinted down the hall and burst out into the courtyard. A few people were already running toward her. Nora waved them back. They stopped, confused.

Nora looked around frantically. The fountain in the middle of the yard was no longer reflecting her face. Instead, the water had been replaced with a thick, dark liquid.

""What's going on?"" someone asked.

Nora shook her head. ""I don't know.""

The alarm stopped abruptly. Nora turned away from the fountain and saw an ominous black cloud rising up over the cliff behind her. The vapor swirled in a vortex, growing larger and darker as it rose higher.

The colonists screamed as the cloud enveloped them. Nora felt a cold chill run through her body. She stared at the swirling mass of darkness. It wasn't fog or dust.

The cloud was alive.

Nora backed away, terrified. The cloud spread across the courtyard, engulfing everyone who had come outside to investigate the alarm.
