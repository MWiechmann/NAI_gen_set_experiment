0,0.6,"The colony's central courtyard was a vast expanse filled with rows of identical low-slung buildings, each housing its own residents. The colonists' communal kitchens were open to everyone, so Nora picked up a tray and joined the line at one of the food stations. She took her place in the long queue behind two other people, both dressed in the same utilitarian uniform as herself.

The line moved slowly, but Nora didn't mind; she was used to being hungry. As the morning progressed, the cafeteria filled with more people, some of whom were already eating. A few glanced over at Nora as they passed her, but no one said anything. She felt their eyes on her, though, like invisible fingers trailing across her skin.

Nora finished her meal and returned to the dormitory, where she washed dishes and stacked them in the recycler for later use. She then grabbed a fresh set of clothes and headed back out into the courtyard.

A soft chime announced her arrival, and the door slid aside with a hiss. Nora walked through the threshold and stopped dead, mouth agape. The entire room was packed with people, most of whom were wearing the same bright orange jumpsuits as Nora. In the middle of the group stood a man in a dark blue suit. He had short, blond hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to bore holes through Nora's brain.

""Good morning, Miss Decker,"" he greeted her cheerfully. ""Please come in.""

Nora stared at him blankly. She couldn't have heard correctly. What was this?

The man smiled broadly. ""I'm your new supervisor, Dr. O'Donnell. I'd like to welcome you to the colony.""

Nora blinked. Her head was spinning with confusion. ""My... my what?""

""Your supervisor, Miss Decker,"" the man repeated patiently. ""You're joining our team. Your duties will be to maintain the colony's machinery, make repairs, and oversee its growth. I've been assigned to help train you in these tasks.""

He gestured toward a stack of papers on one of the tables. On top of the pile was Nora's contract. She stared at it dumbfounded. How could they possibly expect her to sign something like this? She didn't know anything about the Company or the colonists!",74.0,5,44.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
1,0.6,"The hallways were empty save for a few people hurrying to their duties. The colony's automated systems kept everyone fed and comfortable, but the colonists still had to do their own work. Most of the colonists were up early anyway, so Nora found herself alone in the corridors.

She walked briskly toward the mess hall. Her boots clanged on the metal floor as she passed the dormitories. At the end of the corridor, the communal showers waited. She slowed to a stop, looking over her shoulder at the closed door.

She heard the sound of the water first, then the faintest hint of voices. She recognized Nora's voice.

The sounds grew louder.

Nora stepped into the shower area, then turned back to the door. She reached out and knocked lightly. ""Eve?""

""Yes, Nora,"" Eve responded in a low, calm tone.

""I'm ready.""

""Come in, Nora.""

Nora opened the door and stepped inside. The shower room was large enough to accommodate several people at once. Three other women were already there, dressed in similar clothes. All three looked up from their conversation and greeted her with friendly smiles.

""Morning, Nora!"" one of them called.

The others chorused, ""Good morning, Nora!""

They seemed happy to see her.

""You're early this morning,"" another woman said. She smiled warmly as she spoke.

Nora didn't respond immediately, instead taking in the rest of the room. A row of cubicles lined the walls. Each contained a bed and small desk. The cubicles were separated by doors, which opened out onto shared areas.

The shower area at the far end of the room had been converted into a communal bathroom. It held two showers, one for each gender, plus a toilet and sink.

""I just got up,"" Nora explained. ""I couldn't sleep.""

""Oh."" The other woman's smile faded. She looked at the others in the room, then back to Nora. ""We should be getting ready soon. We have to finish our shifts today so we can leave on schedule.""

""Okay,"" Nora replied, though she wasn't sure what they meant. ""Where do I go?""",77.0,5,47.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
2,0.6,"The corridor outside the dormitory was narrow, its walls made of smooth, reflective metal plates. The ceiling was low and flat, the floors sloped slightly downward toward the center. Nora walked quickly to avoid falling on her face. She passed other colonists heading in opposite directions, each wearing their own version of a uniform and carrying their own personal loaders and tools.

Nora reached the mess hall at the far end of the hallway and turned left to walk through the double doors.

A wave of heat washed over Nora as she entered the large room, and she paused to let it wash over her. A long counter ran along one side of the room. In front of it were several rows of high stools that faced a row of small tables. On the wall above the counter, a clock showed the time.

The colony was located in a remote region where the sun never rose. This room was the only place Nora could get fresh air and sunlight. She took a seat at the nearest table, which was already crowded with two other colonists who had come to eat before starting work.

Nora fidgeted uncomfortably as she waited for her food. She knew from experience how much trouble the Colony Manager made when colonists skipped meals. Nora hadn't missed a meal in days, but that wasn't going to last forever.

She pulled out her tray and placed it on the tabletop. As she did so, the door behind her opened.

The man who walked in was tall, lean, and dark haired. He wore an olive drab uniform and carried himself with confidence. Nora didn't know him, but she recognized his bearing. The Colony Manager.

""Nora Decker?"" he asked. His tone was polite but cold. ""I'm Captain Michael Breen.""

""Yes, sir,"" Nora replied. She stood up to shake hands.

Captain Breen was a good ten centimeters taller than Nora. She had to look up into his eyes. It was unnerving, like looking at a stranger.",65.0,6,46.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
3,0.6,"The dormitory halls were quiet, the colonists asleep in their beds. Nora stopped at a small kitchen to grab a bowl and spoon. She found a few stale pastries left over from yesterday's meal. The colony had rationed food supplies as much as possible. There was little waste, but the colonists didn't have much to spare.

The dining hall was empty save for the two women eating alone at one of the long tables. Nora slid into the seat next to them, digging into her bowl. She chewed slowly while she watched the other woman eat.

""Morning,"" said the woman. Her name was Evelyn. She wore her brown hair cut short and neat. A pale scar ran across her cheekbone.

Nora nodded, swallowing her mouthful of mushy cereal. ""Hi.""

Evelyn finished chewing before speaking again. ""I don't know how you do it, Nora. I've been up since four, and my eyes are killing me.""

""It's not so bad,"" Nora replied. She kept her tone even. It was rare for anyone to complain about being awake this early. ""You get used to it after a while. And we're supposed to be working today, remember?""

Evelyn shrugged. ""Yeah. I'm going down to the power plant. I'll see if there's anything broken. You go on ahead and eat breakfast.""

Nora ate her last bite, set her bowl aside, and stood. ""Thanks. See ya later.""

She walked through the main hall into the corridor. The door to the dining hall opened behind her, and Evelyn stepped out. Nora turned back toward the kitchen and caught a glimpse of Evelyn's face.

A strange expression crossed Evelyn's features for an instant, then she smiled. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora paused. Something wasn't right. She glanced at Evelyn's eyes, which were blue and normal. Then Nora realized what was wrong with her vision.

Her eyes were red and glowing like those of a vampire.

Nora stared at Evelyn in shock, unable to believe what she saw. Her skin felt cold despite the heat of her body. A chill crept up Nora's spine, making her tremble.

""Nora? Are you okay?""

The woman who called herself Evelyn held out her hands. They weren't red and glowing like Nora's. They were pale and unmarked.",83.0,4,41.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
4,0.6,"The corridor outside her room was empty except for the automated doors at the end of each hall. The automated door guards were programmed to let anyone pass, but they also served as sentry points. They monitored the halls for intruders and opened the outer gates for colonists leaving the dormitories.

The hallway outside Nora's room was lined with identical rooms, their open doors revealing the small, utilitarian furnishings inside. She passed several other rooms where colonists slept in silence, their breathing a rhythmic sound like waves on distant shores.

Nora walked past the last door to the end of the hall, where she turned right and headed for the communal showers. The cold water would help wash away the lingering cobwebs from sleep.

She pushed through the swinging door and stopped short, surprised by what lay beyond it.

A large rectangular pool occupied the middle of the floor. A series of steps led down to a wide ledge around the edge of the pool, and along its side ran a long, thin bench with a row of lockers underneath.

Atop the opposite wall stood an automated showerhead, spraying water into the air in a gentle stream. A line of soap dispensers sat beside the locker area. Several more benches lined the walls on either side of the pool, and the far end was filled with a bank of toilet stalls.

The scene looked inviting, but Nora hesitated to enter the pool. It might be contaminated with the hive's filth.

In her mind, she envisioned a swarm of drones waiting for her in the deep waters.

With a sigh, Nora stepped over the threshold and lowered herself onto the bench closest to the showers.",91.0,8,43.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
5,0.6,"The halls were dimly lit by dim blue lights at intervals. Nora navigated along them, listening for the sound of voices. She passed a few colonists moving about their duties in the early morning hours, but none were awake yet. The only sounds she heard came from the corridor walls.

The hallways were lined with doors leading to different rooms. She stopped at one of the doors and pressed her ear against it, hearing nothing. With a sigh, Nora knocked on the door twice, waited for someone to answer, then opened the door to enter.

Inside was a small room with three beds and a communal bathroom. Nora turned around, surprised that no one had come to see who had entered the room. She walked back out of the dormitory and closed the door behind her.

She paused outside the entrance to listen again, this time straining to hear any noise coming from inside. A faint clatter sounded through the wall, followed by a muffled curse.

Nora crept into the room and peeked through the window beside the door. She saw an empty bed and a pile of clothing on the floor. But the clattering sound continued. Nora peered around the corner, but couldn't tell what was making it.

""Hey, you,"" Nora called out. ""I'm talking to you.""

The clattering ceased. There was a long pause, then a thump from the other side of the room. Nora winced at the sound of something heavy falling over.

A moment later, a pale, gaunt figure emerged from the shadows. It was thin, wearing tattered clothes and a stained apron. Its face was covered in dark stubble and its eyes were sunken and bloodshot.

Nora stared at the person for several seconds before she realized it wasn't a person.",85.0,5,49.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
6,0.6,"The corridors were empty, quiet save for the soft creak of Nora's boots. The corridor walls were a dull gray color with dark metallic veins. She felt her way along the wall, counting the doors as she passed them. She reached the end of the hall without incident.

Nora entered the main dining room to find it empty except for a lone figure at one of the tables. Sully sat alone, wearing a thick coat and hat over his hairless head. His long fingers gripped the table edge as he stared into space.

He looked up when Nora approached. ""Good morning,"" he said softly, then stood.

""Morning,"" Nora replied. She took a seat opposite him.

Sully nodded to her with a faint smile. He wore a pale blue shirt under his coat, the collar turned up around his ears. Nora noticed that his eyes were red rimmed.

Nora glanced away from him, looking toward the front door as if she could see through it and into the stormy weather beyond. She shivered.

""I'm going out."" Nora paused, uncertain how to continue. ""To check on something. I'll be back soon. We can eat together.""

She pushed her chair back from the table. Sully's lips twitched.

Nora gathered her jacket and left the room. She didn't look back.

Outside, she found an empty hallway and followed it to the exit. The wind blew hard, forcing her to take deep breaths before she stepped outside. Nora pulled her hood up over her head, then checked her wristwatch as she walked briskly down the path. It was 8: 30 AM.

The sun had risen only a few minutes ago. Nora squinted at the bright light and turned her face away, shielding her eyes with one hand. She felt exposed without sunglasses or goggles. But she knew they wouldn't work in this environment.

Nora followed the winding path out of the settlement, passing several more buildings until she reached the edge of the colony.",72.0,4,40.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
7,0.6,"The corridors were empty at this early hour. The lights blinked dimly, making the long hallways seem even darker than they really were. Even the ceiling panels overhead seemed to glow faintly.

Nora found herself in a large dining area where rows of tables were lined up in neat, orderly fashion. She took her place among the other colonists at a table near the front of the room. They sat silently as she scanned their faces for familiar ones.

Most of the colonists looked like her, but there were a few others. Some were older, some younger. Nora spotted several women and two men who didn't look like her at all. Most of them wore dark clothing, while a few had on brightly colored tunics. A handful of people had on the same kind of clothes that Nora did, but most of them were dressed differently.

Nora tried to count heads. There should have been thirty or so of them. But when she glanced around the room, she noticed that a couple of people weren't sitting with the rest. One man stood off in the corner by himself and another woman was missing.

She frowned as she tried to figure out what could be wrong. Something about the situation felt... off. She'd seen enough movies and holos to know how important it was for a group of strangers to stick together in a crisis.

But this wasn't a movie. This was reality. And the colony was on its own. The Company wouldn't come back for weeks.

Nora's heart beat faster as she remembered the last time she'd been alone in a hostile environment. It hadn't ended well.

""You're late,"" said a voice from behind her.

Startled, Nora turned and saw that the man who had spoken was standing next to the table. He looked like he belonged here. Tall and muscular, with short, dark hair, his skin was tanned and weathered. His eyes were a striking shade of green, and they seemed to look right through her.

He wore a loose shirt that hung open over a pair of tight pants.",77.0,5,53.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
8,0.6,"The hallways were dimly lit and empty except for Nora's footsteps. The colony's power plant hummed in the background, a steady drone punctuated by occasional bursts of mechanical whine. Her boots echoed loudly on the smooth flooring.

Nora paused to glance at the digital clock on the wall beside the door. Six thirty. She was early, but the colonists had already been up for hours. Nora didn't mind. A little extra time to get her head straight wasn't going to hurt.

The commotion from the command center reached her ears as she walked along the corridor. Voices shouted over one another. A few people were running through the corridors, carrying tools and equipment. More voices called out directions to each other.

Nora stopped outside the command center. She listened for a moment, then pushed open the heavy doors. Inside was chaos. People ran back and forth across the room, shouting orders and commands. Equipment clattered and whined. Nora stood in the doorway, unsure what to do.

The noise subsided into a quiet murmur. Nora stepped inside. The scene around her seemed unreal. She couldn't see anyone standing still. Everyone moved with purpose, but no two people were doing the same thing. One person sat at a table covered in schematics and maps. Another man paced behind him, muttering instructions under his breath. Two women bent over a computer console, their heads close together and fingers flying over the keys.

A woman wearing thick gloves grabbed Nora by the arm and tugged her forward.""Nora!""She looked down at Nora's face. Her eyes widened.""You're early! You missed the first shift meeting.""""I know,""said Nora. She shook her head, trying to clear it.""But I'm here now.""The woman squeezed Nora's forearm reassuringly.""Good. Come on, we'll need you in the garage.""""Garage?""""They've got a problem with one of the power loaders. We'll have to take it apart and fix it.""""Right,""Nora said. She followed the woman through the corridors.

The command center had a small garage attached to its outer wall. Nora hadn't noticed it before. The garage was empty except for an old, battered tractor-type vehicle. A thin layer of dust covered its wheels and tires.

The woman led Nora to a door in the back corner of the garage.",75.0,5,43.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
9,0.6,"The hallways were dimly lit by yellow lights that flickered overhead. The walls, floors, ceilings, and even the doorframes were made of metal plates welded together. A few small plants grew in pots at intervals along the halls to keep them from feeling too empty.

As she walked, Nora heard the distant sound of machinery and the hum of power tools. She stopped to peer down a side hallway where several workers were busily welding something onto the wall. In front of each worker was a large rectangular box that looked like a tool rack. One of the workers glanced up at her. He smiled as he saw Nora's confused expression, then continued his work.

She turned away, shaking her head in confusion. She'd seen this sort of thing before. Why didn't I know about these?

Nora shook her head again. Maybe there wasn't time to learn everything. She had no idea how many other things she would have missed.

But what if we're not prepared for anything else? What if some other problem comes up that we can't handle?

Her stomach rumbled. Nora started down the corridor toward the mess hall. She passed a door marked ""Maintenance."" It was closed and dark, but the faint smell of oil lingered. Nora tried to imagine what went on inside, but couldn't picture it clearly enough to make sense of the noises she heard.

The mess hall was open and bright with morning sunlight. Several workers sat at long tables, eating breakfast or talking quietly over their meal. Nora spotted the cook and a couple of helpers nearby. They were busy at the stove, stirring and flipping food as they cooked it.

Nora paused outside the doorway to get her bearings. The mess hall was located in one corner of the colony, near the hydroponics greenhouse. Past the mess hall, Nora could see rows of greenhouses that stretched out into the distance. A few workers milled around the greenhouse walls, tending to crops and watering plants.

The mess hall itself was long and narrow, lined with large metal plates that looked like cafeteria trays. Most of the tables were empty except for a handful of workers who ate alone, hunched over their meals and staring down at the table in front of them. Nora recognized several from her engineering class.

She stepped through the door and headed for an empty table. She picked up a tray and filled it with eggs, toast, bacon, and fresh fruit. As she sat down, Nora noticed the man sitting across from her. He was tall and thin, wearing a black uniform that fit him snugly.",74.0,6,44.0,0.36,0.21599999999999997
10,0.65,"Nora paused outside the door to her dormitory and listened for movement inside. A few colonists stirred, groaned in their beds, or muttered indistinctly as they worked through another nightmare. The sound of the alarm was still ringing faintly from her room, but it faded quickly as she left the building.

The air in the hall was chill and dry, carrying traces of dust and vapor. Nora took a deep breath to clear her lungs, then turned toward the dining area.

Nora entered the large communal space. In the dim glow of emergency lighting, the tables were empty except for a single person sitting at one end.

Valentina Kern. Commander Kern sat alone, staring at her hands folded in her lap. Her eyes were shadowed in dark hollows, and her lips were pressed together tightly. She wore a long coat with a hood over her shoulders, despite the warmth of the day.

Nora hesitated. Valentina looked like a lost child waiting for a parent to notice her presence. But if Valentina wanted company, she would ask. Nora had been too preoccupied with work to talk to anyone else since arriving.

Nora stepped forward and cleared her throat. Valentina's head snapped up, and her expression hardened. She stood up abruptly and walked away without saying a word.

Nora watched the commander go, and then returned to her own quarters. The alarm was still going off in her room, but she ignored it. She'd get a new one soon enough.

Nora pulled on her boots and jacket, then left the dormitory and headed to the mess hall. Breakfast was always the same thing here. Bacon, eggs, toast, and coffee. It tasted like ashes in her mouth, and she didn't know why. She couldn't remember eating anything today.

As Nora approached the dining area, a thin woman with stringy black hair hurried out of an adjacent door. She wore a heavy coat over faded blue jeans, and carried a clipboard tucked under one arm.

""You're late,"" the woman scolded. ""Breakfast starts in twenty minutes.""

Nora frowned at the stranger. She had a tired look about her, like she hadn't slept well last night. Her eyes were red and swollen from crying, and her cheeks were gaunt.

Nora stepped aside to let the other woman pass, and then followed behind.",72.0,6,43.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
11,0.65,"The corridor outside the dormitories was dark and quiet except for the soft whirring of power loaders from the engineering bays. The halls were dim, but she could still make out the shapes of the other colonists. They slept in small groups in their rooms, a few of them sitting up to watch her pass.

She walked briskly along the hall, nodding at those who acknowledged her presence. A few of the women gave her curious looks as they noticed her boots, but most kept their eyes focused on the floor. She was used to it.

The smell of fresh coffee tickled her nose as she reached the end of the hallway. Nora peered into the cafeteria. Several tables were filled with people eating breakfast, but no one seemed to notice her. She turned back around the corner and continued down the long passage.

Nora's destination was the mess hall. It was located at the far end of the colony and separated from the rest of the complex by a wide walkway. She made her way through the corridors and stopped in front of the entrance, which was marked with a large blue door. The door had an electronic lock that required a code to open.

She looked up at the door. There wasn't much time before she had to leave for work, so she punched in her four-digit code. As soon as the door slid open, Nora stepped inside and locked it behind her.

The interior of the mess hall was bright and airy. The walls were lined with a variety of potted plants and hanging baskets. A wide table dominated the center of the room, and several chairs and stools surrounded it. The floor was tiled in dark gray ceramic, with a scattering of colorful rugs over the surface. At the back of the room, a counter provided seating and food service.

A few colonists sat at the table, eating breakfast and talking quietly. Nora walked up to the counter and placed her order. While she waited, she watched the other patrons. Most of them kept their eyes on the food in front of them, but a couple of people glanced at her as they passed.

Her meal arrived just as she finished paying. She picked up a plate and loaded it with eggs, bacon, and toast. Her hunger didn't diminish after the first bite.",88.0,6,48.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
12,0.65,"Nora made her way past the dormitories to the communal dining hall. The dimly lit interior was filled with the sounds of groaning stomachs. A few colonists were already seated at long tables, eating their breakfasts. Nora headed straight for a table near the back of the room where she could see the kitchen.

She took a seat next to a young man who looked like he had just woken up. He was tall, dark haired, and handsome with strong features. Nora liked him immediately but didn't know his name.

""Morning,"" she greeted him.

He blinked bleary eyes in response. ""Uh... morning.""

""I'm Nora,"" she said.

His brow furrowed as he tried to place her face. ""Oh, right, I remember now. You're the engineer who fixed the communications system last night. Nice work, Nora. That was pretty tricky.""

Nora's mouth quirked upward in a half smile. ""Thanks. It wasn't too bad.""

""Yeah? I mean, it was good work.""

Nora nodded and sipped her coffee. The hot drink warmed her throat on its way down. She looked around the room. Most colonists were still asleep or eating breakfast.

""What do you think of this place?"" she asked.

The man shrugged. ""It's okay. Not my thing. Don't really see the appeal myself. But if you're going to live out here, then you'll have to put up with a lot of things.""

""That's why they pay us,"" Nora said. ""We get paid for putting up with stuff.""

He chuckled. ""Good point. I've been meaning to ask you something. How come you're the only engineer on duty? Shouldn't there be two?""

Nora glanced at him in surprise, but he was already digging into his scrambled eggs.

""There were a couple of other engineers working last night,"" Nora said slowly. ""But they both called in sick today.""

He gave her an amused look. ""Sick? Seriously?""

She nodded. ""They're probably just getting their sleep in. They'll be fine.""

""Oh, I don't know. I can see them falling asleep right now and never waking up again.""

""It'll be okay,"" she repeated, more forcefully this time. ""I'm sure they're not contagious.""",77.0,3,44.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
13,0.65,"The corridor leading to the dormitory's kitchen was dark except for the dim glow from a few emergency lights. She couldn't see much in the way of furniture, but the walls were lined with shelves of canned goods, dried fruits, and other staples. The hallways were utilitarian, though. A few doors on either side led to the communal bathrooms, and at the end of each hallway was a large mirror, where Nora could check her appearance for the day.

A faint sound echoed through the halls as she walked toward the cafeteria. Footsteps? Was someone coming? Nora paused, listening intently. No. Just the wind. It whistled around the corners of the corridors.

Nora turned down another corridor that led to the mess hall. It wasn't yet open, so the only illumination came from a few emergency lights. She made her way slowly along the narrow passage, holding onto the wall and peering into the gloom ahead of her with both hands outstretched like a blind person.

The sounds grew louder. Nora stopped, wondering what they could be. She listened again, but heard nothing more. Whatever it was, it sounded as if it was moving away. As if it was going to stop.

Nora continued forward, the tension in her stomach building. She couldn't see anything now, but the noises were getting closer. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled.

She reached the end of the corridor and peeked out into the bright, expansive cafeteria. Empty. But the noise had been close. Very close. Nora glanced down at her feet, where she saw a small scrap of material caught between two toes. She bent down to pick up the scrap of cloth.

It was a piece of fabric. A shirt sleeve. Torn and stained with dirt. Her gaze followed the length of the arm down until she realized that the arm wasn't attached to the body. It lay in the middle of the floor.

Nora dropped the sleeve and backed away from the corpse. She didn't want to look, but it was impossible not to.",82.0,5,49.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
14,0.65,"She passed through a series of hallways to reach the mess hall, where she paused to check the time. The kitchen should be open by now. She walked to the cafeteria and peered inside. A tall man in coveralls stood at one end of the long, rectangular room, leaning over a counter. He glanced up as she entered, then went back to work.

Nora wandered toward the far wall, trying to decide if she wanted cereal or eggs. When she got closer, she saw that there were no tables. Instead, the room was filled with small round plastic plates with blue and white patterns. The patterned plates looked like they'd been manufactured from sheets of thin, flat glass, but Nora knew better.

The plates were made of synthetic materials. They were sturdy, durable, and lightweight, but they couldn't hold food. And yet the colonists ate off them every day.

Nora stared down at the plates in confusion for a moment, then turned and left the cafeteria. She needed to find someone who could explain what was going on.

As Nora walked along a hallway, she noticed that the walls were lined with windows. The view out of each window was obscured by the metal frames, but she could see enough to tell she wasn't in a city or town.",81.0,6,54.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
15,0.65,"The colony's main corridor curved around a central hub where two staircases met. The hub itself had four support columns, each wide enough to carry multiple walkways across its surface. On the other side of the hub was a large open area filled with greenhouses. A long table stretched along one wall, piled high with food trays and drinks.

Nora walked over to the table, grabbed a tray, and took a seat at the end nearest the door. She'd never been in this part of the building before. It was different from the residential wing. More utilitarian, less colorful. Nora didn't know why. She just knew she liked it better here.

She poured herself a cup of coffee, then sat back to wait. Her stomach growled in anticipation as she surveyed the mess on her plate. Breakfast had already arrived. She picked up a fork and began eating.

""Oh, hello there.""

Nora jumped out of her skin. She looked down to see a young man standing behind her, smiling. He wore a plain blue shirt and tan pants with a belt. His hair was dark brown and his eyes were bright. Nora couldn't help but notice he had a nice smile. It made her feel safe.

""Um, hi,"" she said awkwardly. ""You startled me.""

He chuckled. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.""

""That's okay. You weren't too loud, anyway."" She glanced around. ""Where are your quarters?""

""Over here."" He gestured toward the opposite end of the hall.

Nora nodded and turned her attention back to breakfast. She continued eating while she walked toward the new arrival, who was now seated at the table in the middle of the room.",84.0,4,41.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
16,0.65,"The corridors were lined with rows of doors. Each door was marked by a nameplate indicating its occupant's duties. Nora paused at the end of the hall, looking down each row for her own room number. The first door she tried was locked.

""Hello?"" She knocked lightly on the door. ""Nora? You in there?""

No answer.

She sighed, then rapped harder. ""I know you're awake. I can hear you breathing.""

There was no reply.

Nora frowned, feeling a growing sense of unease. She glanced back down the corridor, but saw only empty space. No one else seemed to be around.

What if I'm not alone? What if it's just an intruder who got into my quarters while I slept? But what would they want with me?

With a quick glance over her shoulder, Nora ran to the next room on the left. Her heart beat faster in her chest as she knocked and called for someone inside.

Nothing happened.

Nora swallowed hard and pushed open the door. A large, dark-haired man stood behind a desk, leaning against it with arms folded across his broad chest. He wore a simple white shirt, a pair of black slacks, and a tie. His hair was cropped short and he had prominent cheekbones and a long nose.

""Nora,"" he said in greeting. ""You're late.""

Nora blinked, surprised by the calm tone in his voice.",75.0,2,44.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
17,0.65,"The corridors were empty, except for Sully at the end of the hall, where he stood talking to someone outside one of the dormitory doors. His back was turned, but she could tell by his stance that he was listening intently as the other person spoke.

Nora paused in front of him. ""Sully?""

""Morning, Nora."" He nodded to her and continued the conversation. She watched him for a moment, then walked past, nodding politely.

She stopped again at the top of the stairs leading up to the engineering bays. The door was closed, but she heard voices coming from inside. She knocked lightly on the heavy metal panel.

A deep voice answered, sounding tired. ""Yeah? What is it?""

""Hey, Sully. I'm going down to breakfast. You want anything?""

""No thanks.""

Nora paused in the hallway for a moment, watching him. His face was drawn and pale with fatigue. ""You look like you haven't slept well. Are you okay?""

He shrugged. ""I'll be fine."" He glanced at her, then quickly looked away. ""Thanks for asking, though.""

The rest of Nora's shift passed uneventfully. Her duties were routine, mostly maintenance and repair work. When she was finished, Nora went down to the cafeteria.

Nora sat alone in a corner table near the kitchen. She'd been here long enough that most of the other workers knew her by name, but she still felt an odd sense of anonymity. The colony was a small place, and she was one of only three women working there.

She picked at her food listlessly. She didn't feel hungry, even though it had been hours since the last meal.

A sudden hush fell over the dining hall. Everyone turned to look in the direction of the main concourse, where the sound came from.

Nora stood up and followed the rest of the people toward the center of the room. A tall man wearing a black jumpsuit strode down the middle aisle, his hands clasped behind him. He wore no helmet, and his dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail.

He stopped in front of the cafeteria door and waited for everyone to gather around him. ""All right, listen up,"" he said. ""I'm Captain Jacobo.""",78.0,4,47.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
18,0.65,"The colony's power plant stood at the center of the settlement. A wide, three-story structure, the power plant rose high above the surrounding rocky cliffs like a steel cathedral. It resembled a gigantic, boxy spaceship. The broad, flat roof was covered in solar panels, and two large exhaust ports flared along the front of the building.

Nora climbed the stairs to the second level. At the top, she entered the command center, where Sully sat behind a table cluttered with maps, charts, and data readouts. He looked up when he heard Nora enter.""Good morning, Nora,""he said, waving her toward one of the empty chairs around the table.""You're late. You've got five minutes.""""I'm sorry, sir. I was—I just had a lot to do before work today, so...""""And you can't sleep?""Sully asked sympathetically.""No, not really. So what did you need?""Nora glanced down at the sheets of paper scattered across his desk, then sighed.""These are my notes from last night's meeting. I wanted to make sure they were accurate.""""That sounds good,""Sully nodded.""But we'll get back to them later. First, let me ask, how are your quarters? Are they comfortable enough?""Nora frowned. The Company didn't pay for accommodation. Instead, it provided everything colonists needed: food, water, shelter, and utilities. But the company also insisted that colonists keep their quarters clean and in good repair, even though it wasn't mandatory. The dormitories were cramped, but Nora felt bad complaining about them since she was the only engineer among the colonists.

Nora thought about mentioning her concerns to Sully, but instead she shrugged and shook her head.""Fine, sir. I guess.""She picked up a sheet of paper off his desk and slid it across to him.""Here's the report on the malfunctioning power generators. We have three machines left, all of which are still working, but the rest are all out. The first two we can fix with a little time, but the third generator needs to be replaced. I think I know who can do it, but I'll double check.""""I see,""Sully murmured, reading over Nora's notes. She noticed he had a long, thin scar running down his right cheek and jaw.""How are things at the medical bay?""""Oh, fine, sir. I'll give you an update later.""",83.0,5,42.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
19,0.65,"The colony's common area was crowded with colonists, all dressed in their work clothes. Most were sleeping off the previous night's exhaustion, but the rest sat at tables or stood around talking. A few heads turned as Nora walked by, but no one spoke to her.

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the upcoming day. She hated this place. The colony was harsh and unforgiving. But she'd learned to put up with it. If not for the Company, there wouldn't be anyone left alive.

A tall man in a dark blue uniform approached her from behind as she passed through the crowd.""Good morning,""he said. His voice was raspy, like he hadn't slept well. He extended a hand toward Nora.""I'm Lieutenant Lyle.""Nora glanced at his hand, then back at him.""Lieutenant?""""Yes, I work in command center. You're new here, aren't you? How are you liking the job so far?""He wasn't young, but he looked fit and strong. Nora knew that he worked hard.

Nora nodded.""It's pretty rough, sir.""""You'll get used to it. We all do.""His eyes drifted away, looking out over the colony grounds.

The lieutenant turned his head toward her again as if just remembering something.""You know, there was an incident last night...""""An incident?""Nora asked, startled.

Lyle nodded slowly.""Last night we lost a scientist. Someone broke into the lab and murdered him. They stole some of our equipment. It was quite... unfortunate.""Nora swallowed, feeling her stomach clench. She'd been through enough incidents before. But this one hit too close to home.""What happened?""she asked.

Lyle grimaced.""We don't really know yet. The intruder must have been very good. He disabled our security systems. Nobody knows how he got past them or what he did when he was inside.""Nora's heart beat faster, but she forced herself not to let it show on her face.

The lieutenant looked back out at the colony.""Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. We've got better security now, and we'll find whoever killed him. But it's going to take us a while.""Nora nodded.",82.0,4,46.0,0.42250000000000004,0.274625
20,0.7,"The hallway to the dormitories was dimly lit and cold as she walked toward the front doors at the end of the hall. At the door, Nora paused, taking a deep breath and trying to calm herself. She could hear voices from the other side of the door.

""You're sure about this?"" Sully asked in a low voice.

Nora knew that voice. It belonged to a tall man named Jack. He was one of the colony's best engineers. The two had worked together many times on jobs, but Nora hadn't spoken to him since he'd become the colony's second engineer.

""Yes,"" Jack replied. ""I'm sure. I've been thinking about it for months.""

Sully sighed. ""Well, if you say so. But be careful.""

The door swung open with a bang as Nora pushed through. A blast of frigid air slapped her in the face. She shivered in shock, trying to catch her balance and steady her breathing as she took in the scene before her.

Nora's eyes widened at the sight of the room full of people. In the middle of the group, a small figure with short dark hair stood awkwardly, leaning against the wall. Her heart skipped a beat as she saw the young woman's face. It was Amy, an old friend who lived in one of the dormitories.

Amy glanced up at Nora and mouthed the words, ""Help me"" .

Nora nodded and stepped forward, trying to move slowly and quietly. When she reached the center of the group, Nora tried to speak.

""What is this?""

She was answered only by a chorus of gasps from those around her. Jack stared at Nora, his mouth hanging open in shock.

""That's Amy,"" he said finally. ""She doesn't understand what's happening.""

Nora felt a chill ripple through her body. She looked back at the girl. Her eyes were wide and glassy, but she made no sound. She wore clothes just like Nora did.",79.0,4,46.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
21,0.7,"A narrow hallway led directly to the cafeteria. The passage was dimly lit by recessed lights. A few colonists walked past her on their way to breakfast, but she ignored them and kept moving. She made it halfway to the dining hall when the door slid open and a man entered. He wore heavy black leather gloves, thick boots, and what looked like body armor over his clothes.

Nora hesitated. This was the first time someone had ever worn that much protective gear in the colony. She knew it wasn't necessary. But even if he hadn't been armed, there were other reasons why this guy might not be welcome.

He stopped at the end of the corridor to look around. His eyes darted left, right, up, down, and back again. Then he turned and went through the doorway.

Nora waited a moment longer for him to leave before following. She caught a glimpse of his face in the cafeteria's mirror as he passed behind her. It was dark, but she thought the stranger looked familiar.

She found her usual seat and sat down, waiting for breakfast to arrive. There was something about him. She could feel it. Something wasn't quite right.

The food arrived, and Nora ate mechanically, staring off into space. After a few bites, her thoughts drifted to the strange man who had come in. She remembered his eyes. They'd seemed so bright, yet cold and emotionless. That wasn't like anyone she knew. And that was only one of many things wrong with him.

Nora finished eating, shoved the tray away, and stood up from the table. She stretched before heading toward the restroom. On her way, she passed the corridor leading to the weapons shop. The door slid open, and a second man entered wearing heavy boots and body armor. He looked over at Nora as she passed. His eyes were a startling gray color, almost silver in the dim light.

He didn't say anything. Didn't acknowledge her presence. He just kept walking.

Nora paused outside the bathroom. She felt a chill run through her blood.

The hairs on the back of her neck prickled.

She turned and ran.",82.0,4,48.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
22,0.7,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists already up and about. Nora walked to the common area where she found a handful of people eating cereal and drinking coffee. She joined them at their table, accepting a mug from the server.

""Good morning,"" said the server. ""I'm Lianna.""

""Hi, Lianna. I'm Nora.""

Lianna smiled warmly. ""It's nice to meet you, Nora. Would you like anything else?""

""No thanks. That'll do fine.""

She took a sip of her coffee while Nora waited for the server to leave. After watching Nora for a moment, Lianna spoke again.

""You're the only engineer, right?""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah. I'm the best. The Company sent me here with this colony because they want me to fix whatever's broken so we can get back home. They pay us pretty well, but it doesn't cover everything. We have a lot of expenses on our own.""

""What kind of stuff breaks down around here? And how often does it happen?""

""Most of the systems are older than my grandparents. We use a lot of old machinery and technology, which isn't exactly cutting edge anymore. Our air filters don't work very well, for example. There aren't any real maintenance crews to keep things running smoothly.""

Lianna paused in her duties, giving Nora a sympathetic look. ""I'm sorry about the filter thing. It must be hard on you guys.""

Nora shrugged with a forced smile. ""It's okay. Nobody likes an inefficient system. But I'd rather deal with the bugs than the drones. Those things come out of nowhere sometimes. They just pop up from inside walls or under floors. They grab people, drag them off into their nests and kill them.""

Lianna grimaced sympathetically. ""That sounds awful! What do they eat?""

""People mostly. Sometimes other colonists. They even eat each other sometimes, if there's not enough food for everyone.""

Nora shuddered at the thought of a hive full of writhing bodies. She took another sip of coffee and watched Lianna finish her rounds, then turn to walk away.

Nora leaned back in her chair with a sigh. ""They're creepy. But they make good fertilizer. The Company is so pleased with us for growing so much food.""",88.0,5,43.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
23,0.7,"The dormitory hallways were dim at this early hour, but the lights blazed brightly when she entered the common room. The kitchen was empty save for a single cook preparing food in the large cooking area.

Nora walked up to the woman and tapped on her shoulder.""Morning,""she said.

The cook turned around, blinking blearily as her eyes adjusted to the low lighting. She was a middle aged white woman with short black hair cut into a severe bob. Her eyes widened as they took in Nora's dark skin, and then narrowed suspiciously.

She glanced over her shoulder toward the door.""What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to let anyone into the kitchen.""""I need breakfast, please.""Nora held out her ration card.

The woman blinked again in confusion.""Ration cards?""""Yes, ma'am.""Nora nodded toward the door.""If you're going to start serving breakfast, I'd like to get some food.""The woman looked confused for a moment longer before nodding and moving away. Nora watched her go, wondering if she could trust the older woman. But the cook was only too happy to serve Nora as soon as she returned. She got a bowl of hot cereal and a plate of bacon.

Nora ate quickly, pausing now and then to stare at the cook while she finished her meal. The woman never once asked why Nora had come in, nor did she try to stop Nora from eating. She was just grateful for the food.

After finishing, Nora wiped her mouth on a paper towel and left without saying anything more.

The dining area was busy with colonists, but there were still plenty of empty tables. Nora chose one near the front window to avoid being crowded.

The panoramic view through the windows offered nothing spectacular except the endless expanse of rocky wasteland, which stretched out into the distance as far as the eye could see. Only a few wispy clouds dotted the sky, and their white tips reflected starlight in a surreal display of cold light. Nora found herself mesmerized by the scene as she waited for her shift to begin.

A tall young man wearing a dark blue uniform came and sat down beside Nora.""Good morning,""he said as he set his tray of food on the table. His name tag read""Javier.""Nora nodded in response, watching him eat silently.",76.0,6,44.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
24,0.7,"The corridors were dimly lit by the red emergency lights set in the ceiling, casting the halls in shades of orange. The air smelled stale. She could see dust motes drifting in the pale glow from the overhead lights.

Nora headed for the kitchen, where she found her friends eating at a table. Sully was sitting on one side of the table, Valentina sat opposite him. They both looked up when Nora entered.""Good morning,""Valentina said, smiling warmly.

Sully nodded politely. He glanced around the room. His eyes lingered on the old and battered appliances. He shook his head slightly, muttering,""I swear. How can they do this to us?""Nora shrugged. The colonists had been complaining about their machines breaking down for months now. With so few spare parts available, repairs took longer than expected. It wasn't unheard of for a machine to break after only two weeks on the planet.

She sighed. She was too tired to care anymore.

They ate quickly, chattering as they tried to keep their minds off the job ahead of them. Nora was just finishing her meal when the alarm went off again. She jumped up with an annoyed snort and stalked out into the hall, pulling her jacket tighter around herself.

The halls were quiet. No sounds of footsteps or voices echoed through the corridors. The silence was unnerving.""Where's everybody?""Nora muttered, frowning at the lack of activity.

Sully pointed toward a door on the left. Nora frowned at him in annoyance.

He raised his hands defensively.""You know what I mean. Where are the colonists? There should be people walking around.""Nora looked over her shoulder. A dim glow came from behind a door across the corridor, but no other lights shone down the hall. She turned back to Sully and shrugged. He sighed, shaking his head.

Valentina spoke up suddenly.""I'm going outside.""""What?""Nora asked. Valentina smiled sweetly at her friend and continued,""It'll be fun. It always is. You'll see.""Nora stared at her, incredulous. Valentina grinned broadly.""Come on. Let's go check it out!""""Wait a minute,""Sully said, holding up a hand. He scowled at her.""Don't you think we need to find some weapons first?""",100.0,4,45.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
25,0.7,"She found Sully at the galley. The cafeteria was already bustling with colonists preparing their own breakfasts. Most were eating alone, but a few groups clustered around tables. One table held four young men and women, each wearing a white coat and sitting on stools in front of the long counter that served as the dining area's far wall.

Nora paused beside the entrance to the kitchen, looking for Sully. She spotted him across the room, standing behind the counter by himself. He wore a dark blue button-down shirt over a black vest with shiny buttons. His hair was slicked back into a tight, short ponytail, and he was chewing his food slowly.

Sully noticed Nora watching him, and gave her a nod. She nodded back, then made her way across the room toward him.

The cafeteria buzzed with noise. Nora passed through the crowd of colonists who stood in line waiting to be served. She scanned the menu on the chalkboard hanging above the serving counters, noting that breakfast options included bacon and eggs, pancakes, sausage patties, hash browns, fresh fruit, milk, orange juice, coffee, tea, and water.

Nora stopped in front of the counter and spoke to Sully. ""Morning, boss.""

""Good morning,"" Sully replied. He offered her a small smile, which she returned.

Nora watched him with an unreadable expression. ""I need to check out the farms today. Can you cover my shift?""

Sully hesitated. ""Sure. What do we have today?""

Nora looked at him quizzically. Sully wasn't averse to working late, but it was unusual for him to volunteer for extra shifts.

""It's just a quick look around the greenhouses. I'm sure I can find something else to do with our time.""

Sully frowned. He pursed his lips and thought about it. Then he sighed and nodded. ""All right. You're in charge. I'll leave you to it.""

He walked away, leaving Nora alone with her breakfast. She ordered a plate of bacon, eggs, and hash browns. As the food arrived, she dug into the meal.",87.0,4,38.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
26,0.7,"The air outside was brisk, but dry, despite its early morning chill. She turned toward the colony's central building where she knew the cafeteria was located.

As she walked along the hallway past rows of doors, a few people glanced up from their work. Some saw her and gave her friendly nods; others just looked away. The faces were worn and tired.

Nora kept her eyes forward, focusing on the path ahead of her rather than the people around her. After a while, the clack of her boots on the grating became the only sound. Nora reached the end of the corridor and began to turn right.

A sudden movement to her left caught her attention. Something black shot out of one of the side corridors, racing straight at her.

Nora's heart slammed into her chest as the thing pounced on her back, pinning her arms down. It had talons that dug deep into her shoulders and throat. Her face was buried in the creature's thick fur and she couldn't breathe.

Nora tried to scream, but the creature bit down on her neck and the pain overwhelmed her. She thrashed wildly under the weight of the beast, trying to throw it off, but it held her firmly in place with its claws.

Terrified, Nora stopped struggling. The monster's grip tightened around her throat until she felt her windpipe close. Her vision went dark.

The thing on top of her snarled. Its breath was hot and rancid, filled with the smell of stale sweat. Nora gagged. She could barely feel her hands.

Her mind flashed to the last time she'd been pinned like this. It was a nightmare from her childhood. The beast would kill her if she didn't do something fast.

She started to panic, and then she saw the knife on her belt. A surge of adrenaline kicked in, giving her strength. As the thing's jaws clamped down, Nora twisted the blade out of its scabbard.

She slammed the hilt into the creature's face as hard as she could. The impact knocked it back several feet. Nora scrambled free and ran for the end of the hallway where the cafeteria was located.",74.0,4,43.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
27,0.7,"Nora followed the corridor to the common area where the colony's mess hall was located. The place was dark except for a few lights dimly glowing through windows set high in the walls. This section of the colony was designed with a central concourse that connected each wing.

At one end of the concourse, a wide stairway spiraled up to the command center. At the other, a long table was arranged along both sides of the passage for dining purposes.

Nora found a seat at the table near the door. She sat on a stool while she waited for the meal to be prepared. A few colonists passed her on their way out of the mess hall, but no one said anything as they went about their day.

After Nora had finished her meal and cleaned up, she walked down the short hallway that led back to her quarters. Her boots clicked loudly on the metal decking as she hurried toward the stairs.

In her haste, she failed to notice a drone standing in the shadows of the corridor. It was tall and narrow with shiny black skin. The insectoid creature stood motionless like a statue until Nora rounded the corner and was out of sight. Then it began to follow her.

The drone crept after Nora silently, its head swiveling around to keep track of the human. It didn't want to risk being seen or heard. So it stayed close enough that if Nora turned, she would see it right away.

Nora paused when she reached the bottom of the staircase leading up to the command center. She looked over her shoulder at the hovering, silent drone. A chill rippled through her body, followed by a wave of nausea. She felt sick.

Nora swallowed hard and took the steps two at a time, hurrying up the long stairway. The drone followed. Nora's heart pounded in her chest. Her palms were sweating. Her mouth was dry. Her stomach churned.

She climbed the stairs with every step feeling like she was going to throw up.",73.0,5,46.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
28,0.7,"She made her way past the dormitories to the communal kitchen. Her boots clacked along the tiled floors as she walked, leaving behind damp footprints that quickly dried in the morning chill. The air was sharp and crisp and the sun's rays were still pale.

The kitchen was a long, narrow room with large, glassless windows at either end. One window looked out onto the desert, and the other opened up to the hills beyond the walls of the colony. Sunlight reflected off the windowpanes, making the interior appear brighter than it actually was.

There was no one else around, but Nora knew that wouldn't last for long. The colonists woke early to begin their day. They'd be filtering in from the dormitories soon enough.

Nora paused, looking out the window toward the desert. She could see a few people walking in the distance, but the view was obscured by the rolling fog. A drone circled overhead, and Nora shivered. She hated drones.

She went back to the kitchen and filled a mug with water, then poured herself a tall cup of coffee. After several minutes of brewing, she carried her drink out into the common area. The room was so cold that condensation formed on the inside of the mug and frosted over the rim.

Nora pulled her chair close to the window, sitting down as far away from the door as possible without leaving the table. She took a sip of her coffee and gazed out at the desert. She tried not to think about the danger lurking just beyond those hills.

Nora had grown up in a small town in Indiana, where everything was familiar. There were only two main roads leading out of town, and the rest of the place was farmland that grew corn and soybeans. She'd never seen anything like this planet before coming here. It seemed so different from Earth.

But it wasn't the same as a new world. This planet was the same age, after all. Nora knew how to work with what she had available. That's why she excelled in engineering—she made do with what she had.

Nora took another sip of coffee and looked out across the fields, trying to get her thoughts organized. Her mind drifted back to when she first arrived. She remembered being overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place. It was an imposing sight, even from a distance.",88.0,6,53.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
29,0.7,"At least the air smelled fresh outside, even if it was still cold. A foggy haze blanketed the landscape, obscuring the sky overhead. She could see only a few meters in front of her, but she didn't need to worry about being lost. The colony's layout was simple and well known.

The first thing she noticed when stepping out of the dormitory were the lights. Each dorm was dimmer than the last. At the end of each hall, the lights were at their lowest level. Nora had always wondered why the colonists kept the lights so low, knowing full well that it would make night activities difficult. She figured it must be for safety reasons.

But now she knew what they did to conserve energy. If the lights went out, the colony wouldn't know. She'd have to find the nearest generator room and hope there wasn't a fire or something worse going on. And Nora didn't like those odds.

She shivered. She wore thick gloves, a hooded coat, and the heavy utility pants. But it was still too cold for her bare feet. With a sigh, she trudged back toward the dormitories.

She entered the command center and took a seat in front of the computer console, which glowed with an amber light. It was the only functional terminal available here in this part of the complex.

With a few clicks of her fingers, she opened the door to her personal data files and accessed the Company's records. She skimmed through the files, looking for the most recent communications. There was no way to filter them by time or priority, but Nora found what she wanted.

There. The latest message from Company headquarters. She opened the file.

Dear Dr. Decker,

We are pleased to inform you that your position has been upgraded to Chief Engineer. You will report directly to me upon your return from your scheduled leave.

Sincerely,

Sully Carmichael

Nora stared at the words for a long moment before closing the file. Then she typed in her password and opened the next file. This one was dated three days ago.

The first thing she saw on the screen was a video message. It showed a middle aged man with thinning hair standing behind an ornate desk. His eyes were gray, his skin pale and wrinkled. He looked ill, but Nora knew he wasn't sick.

He wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and a black tie.",84.0,5,48.0,0.48999999999999994,0.3429999999999999
30,0.75,"The communal dining area bustled with activity. Some colonists had arrived earlier than others to beat the heat; Nora saw two men and a woman seated at one of the long tables. The table held plates piled high with food, the aroma filling her nostrils as she passed it.

She paused in front of the entrance to the dormitory and glanced around. Other colonists were beginning to filter in, but they were a few minutes behind Nora. Most were still asleep, heads lolling on their chests like the sleeping animals from the jungle scenes depicted in old films.

Nora looked toward the stairs leading to the second floor where the colony's infirmary was located, then turned back to face the doorway. The hallway beyond it led deeper into the structure. A quick glance up and down the corridor showed her a couple of people passing along it.

There weren't many other colonists awake yet. Nora headed for the dining room, which was bustling with activity despite its relatively sparse population. At first, Nora felt a little awkward about entering the room while everyone else remained in bed. She considered turning back again and going to the cafeteria instead, but she needed to eat something before leaving the colony or she would get too weak. Besides, the mess hall had better food.

As Nora entered the dining area, a short, stocky man with dark skin and thick hair cut short in front caught her attention. He wore the same kind of coveralls Nora did; they hung loosely on him, showing his muscular frame beneath. His face was sunburned and he carried an energy drink can in one hand as he walked past the long tables to a counter at the far end of the room.

Nora watched him go without thinking, but when she looked up from behind a plate full of bacon and eggs, she saw another man standing across from her. He wore a white lab coat over a pair of black trousers.

The man stepped away from the counter to approach Nora.",73.0,8,47.0,0.5625,0.421875
31,0.75,"The dim halls were empty, except for two people at the end of a long row of identical rooms. They both turned to look as Nora passed them in silence, their expressions grim. The older man looked back at Nora without speaking, his eyes cold and hard. She knew he blamed her for the Colony's problems—and rightly so.

Nora kept to herself while she made her way through the colony, working quietly and efficiently to fix problems where she found them. This was her job. Her duty to the community.

Nora Decker. Born on Earth, raised on Mars, and now living on Presley's Promise with a handful of other colonists. She wasn't one of the Company's employees, but they'd saved her life when her ship crashed out here three years ago, and now she owed them for that. But as much as she liked the idea of being paid to do what she loved, Nora didn't really expect it would come to pass anytime soon.

The colonists were still just beginning to understand how well-developed the alien hive was. It had been dormant since the arrival of the colonists, who hadn't seen any evidence of it before then. But even though it had stayed quiet for years, it wasn't dead. There was always a chance that the hive might be reawakened again, and if that happened...

She shuddered at the thought, and kept moving.

Nora paused outside her lab to look up and down the hallway. All clear. She pushed open the door and stepped inside. A lone light bulb hung from a wire in the ceiling, casting harsh shadows around the room. The air was hot and humid, and carried the smells of ozone and antiseptic. Nora breathed deeply as she turned her attention to the equipment that filled the room. Her engineering team did a great job maintaining the power plant and generating enough electricity for the colony's needs, but there wasn't much else they could do about their own systems.

Nora scanned the room with eyes accustomed to scanning through thick dust clouds.",69.0,7,50.0,0.5625,0.421875

A few minutes later Nora entered the command center for the main operations deck where Sully sat at a console watching the feed from the security cameras and listening to reports. He glanced up when he saw Nora enter the room, then rose with a smile to shake her hand.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted him cheerfully. ""How's your shift going?""

Sully shrugged noncommittally. ""The usual. I'm sure you've noticed.""

Nora nodded. ""I know. It's always busy on the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels of the colony.""

He gestured to the screen showing a view of the corridor outside her quarters. ""You're not kidding. That swarm of drones is still out there. They won't give up.""

""They'll get bored eventually,"" Nora assured him. She watched as one of the drones wandered around the corner. The sight made her shiver. She felt like she could feel its barbed tail probing for a weakness in the hull.

The drone was a large, black insectoid thing with dozens of jointed legs and an oval body covered in thin scales. The creature looked vaguely humanoid but was built for speed and aggression. It walked on two legs, but the other four limbs were thick, multi-jointed, and tipped with a nasty looking set of curved talons.

The drone waddled toward Nora's door, swiveling its head from side to side as if it sensed something that had spooked the rest of the swarm. When it reached the door, it stopped and raised a front leg up to tap on the wood paneling.

""What the hell?"" Sully muttered. ""It can't open the door.""

Nora stood transfixed as the drone used its claw to slide the lock plate aside, then tapped again.",76.0,5,42.0,0.5625,0.421875
33,0.75,"The corridor was quiet as Nora made her way to the communal kitchen. Her boots clomped across the tile in measured strides, leaving a deep impression. She kept her head down and ears perked, scanning for movement along the edges of the hall. Nothing stirred.

The air inside the dining area was warm and stale but not hot. Nora could feel moisture on her face from the misting overhead vents, which she hoped would clear soon enough for them to heat up the water. The lights were dimmed. Most colonists only used the lights when they slept or ate, saving power until their needs demanded it.

Nora found the door to the cafeteria, entered, and walked toward the long, curving tables. She could see the end of one table where several colonists sat together around a large, round machine. Its surfaces glowed softly blue in the muted lighting. Nora couldn't make out any details other than that it looked like a computer.

She sighed. The colonists had been working on repairing or replacing it since the last supply ship arrived two weeks ago. With no new equipment coming in, Nora's job was to keep the old stuff going.

As she approached, Nora heard conversation between the colonists break off and then resume. She paused at the end of the table. They didn't look up as Nora moved past them. One man spoke quietly, so Nora leaned closer, trying to hear him over the hum and whirr of machinery. His words were indistinct.

""The drones are back,"" he said. ""I don't know what they're doing. There shouldn't be more than ten in this area.""

Nora tensed. The drone was an aggressive and voracious creature. She knew that from the Company database. Drones attacked the colonists without provocation, hunting and killing them indiscriminately.

The man continued his low voice. ""... I think we've got it under control for now though.""

That didn't sound good. Nora frowned and edged her way along the table. The other colonists looked up at her, startled when they saw her approach.

She caught one of their gazes and hesitated.",77.0,5,44.0,0.5625,0.421875
34,0.75,"Nora had just finished buttoning up when the chime sounded again. The door slid open to reveal a tall man in dark slacks and a white, short-sleeved shirt. His skin was dark and tan, with deep lines around his eyes. He had thick black hair, and a strong jawline beneath full, expressive lips.

He smiled at her, but Nora did not return the gesture. She stared back, looking for signs of deception. But Sully's expression showed nothing beyond friendly curiosity.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I don't have time to show you around the colony today. This is a big day.""

Nora nodded, still wary of him. ""You're leaving?"" She felt an unexpected stab of disappointment.

Sully shrugged, then gestured down the hall. ""There are other people who want to see this place, too. We're all eager to make a living out here, aren't we? And the Company will be sending ships soon enough. But before they arrive there's something important we need to do.""

Nora followed him through the corridors of the colony, past a handful of sleeping colonists, and into the main concourse. A few people were already gathered at a long table near the far wall, taking breakfast from metal trays. Most of them looked up as Nora and Sully entered.",81.0,5,47.0,0.5625,0.421875
35,0.75,"The corridor outside the dormitory was empty, but at least it wasn't cold. The temperature dropped precipitously as one moved farther from the heat source of the fusion plant.

Nora walked the length of the hall, stepping around clusters of laundry bags piled along the walls where the colonists shared their dirty clothes. She reached a stoplight junction of three corridors. One led to the cafeteria, another to the mess hall, and the third to the garage.

This section of the colony had been built underground to protect the human population from the dangerous environment above. The tunnels were long and twisted, leading from the command center deep into the rocky crags where they emerged in several places near the surface.

Nora hesitated for a moment before turning into the tunnel that would lead her toward the garage. She didn't want to go this way today. If she went straight down to the garage, it wouldn't take more than a few minutes to get there. But if she headed up the tunnel, she'd be lost in the maze of twisting passageways.

She made her decision. Nora turned into the tunnel and followed it deeper into the dark.

The narrow, curving corridor was lit only by occasional glowing strips along the ceiling where emergency lights burned despite the fact that power was out elsewhere on the complex. The air was close, thick with stale smoke and dust from ancient equipment. Nora coughed once or twice, but at least the stench masked the smell of the eggs.

Ahead, she could hear water dripping somewhere deep within the rocks. The sound grew louder until it became a steady stream. She moved faster, eager to reach the next junction and escape from the claustrophobic tunnel.

Nora stopped short when she rounded a corner. A wall of green slime blocked her path, oozing up over the floor like an ugly carpet. At first glance, she thought it looked like fresh vomit. But the color and texture were wrong.",81.0,7,44.0,0.5625,0.421875
36,0.75,"The hallways were quiet as she walked past empty rooms on either side. The dormitories had already been cleaned up for the day, and their occupants gone back to work. A few colonists slept in the rec rooms where they could, but most worked. Some of them stayed late. Most didn't.

Ahead of her was the mess hall. Its long tables were covered by red plastic sheets. Nora paused for a moment, wondering what the other colonists ate. In fact, she wondered if any of them ever got fed at all.

There was another option available to her. She could go to the cafeteria where most people ate, but only after she had eaten. She was so hungry that she didn't care.

After walking through the door, Nora found herself in an immense room with many tables lined with chairs. There were no windows, just a few lamps providing dim illumination from the ceiling.

It smelled like food.

Nora entered cautiously. Her eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light as she scanned the crowd of humans filling the dining area. Everyone was wearing coveralls and hard hats, some even carrying tools. But nobody appeared to be doing anything productive. They all sat there staring blankly into space or down at their hands.

They looked so similar, it was impossible to tell one person from another. Their faces were pale white and lean. Their hair varied from short to shaggy. All of them were thin, except for the few who stood out as noticeably overweight.

Their eyes all looked dead. No one was smiling or talking. Even when a few colonists began singing, the sound seemed forced. The words sounded odd in this setting; they weren't familiar songs. It was almost unsettling to hear voices raised at all.

The silence made Nora uneasy. She had never seen so many people act so... vacant.

A woman walked past her, then another man. Both wore coveralls, but neither of their clothes fit them. They were loose around the waist and shoulders. And both of them had dark circles under their eyes.

Nora stared at the pair, wondering if she should ask about them.",87.0,5,49.0,0.5625,0.421875
37,0.75,"The colony's main hallway led to a long central corridor where a handful of colonists met each morning for breakfast. The hall was wide, well lit, and filled with the sounds of footsteps and voices as people walked along its length. At the far end, the hall emptied into the command center.

Sully stood at the front desk, which was manned by a tall, thin man named Gage. Sully nodded at Nora, and then turned to greet two Company executives who entered through the opposite door. They were both older men in their forties with graying hair and neatly trimmed beards. Both wore crisp white shirts, dark slacks, and black leather shoes. They looked like they had been freshly groomed and dressed for the occasion.

They greeted Sully with polite smiles. When Nora approached, the taller one said,""Good morning, young lady.""His voice was deep and smooth, a contrast to his sharp features that reminded her of an eagle.

Nora responded with a quick curtsy. She knew he would find it odd, but she couldn't help herself. There was something about the way he spoke that made her feel small and unimportant even though he didn't seem to notice. It wasn't arrogance, just confidence born of experience and authority.

Gage was a lot more approachable than Sully, though he still managed to exude a professional air. He took the papers from Nora's hand and set them on the counter, then checked the system's log and logged her in.

She nodded at the two Company representatives as they left to get their own breakfast. Gage asked,""Is there anything else you need, Miss Decker?""""No, thanks.""Gage waited for her to leave before turning back to his work. The colonists were an informal group, so no one bothered with formalities like titles or surnames. Nora just called everyone by first name.""You're late.""Sully gestured at the clock over his desk.

Nora glanced down. The time displayed was ten minutes past eight. She'd overslept, but she hadn't realized how much time had passed until now.",69.0,6,44.0,0.5625,0.421875
38,0.75,"The halls were empty, but the corridors still echoed to the sound of her footsteps as she hurried to catch up with the rest of the colonists. The Company had set up separate shifts for everyone in the colony, so Nora was one of just two people awake at this early hour, and the only one not already working.

She caught the scent of food from somewhere ahead. The smell was faint but tantalizing. Nora wondered if the Company had stocked up on supplies to keep their staff fed during the long winter months.

A few minutes later, a door opened to reveal the commissary. A line of colonists was waiting outside, looking more like refugees than prospectors or explorers. They shuffled along with slumped shoulders and drooping heads as they moved through the doorway into a narrow corridor that led deeper inside the colony.

Nora hesitated, wondering what the colonists did for entertainment here when there wasn't much else to do. She hadn't really thought about it before because she'd been too busy focusing on surviving.

But now, she found herself curious. As Nora waited in line with the other colonists, she watched them enter and begin picking over stacks of metal trays piled high with food items. These were their meals for the day. The Company provided rations, but everyone had to choose their own food from the many options available.

Nora eyed the trays and realized most of the colonists preferred protein bars. These came in a variety of flavors, some made from dried meat, nuts, grains, and vegetables. Some even contained bits of chocolate.

The Company had stocked up on supplies to last the colonists until the next supply ship arrived, but that didn't mean they could be picky. Nora's stomach gurgled at the prospect of filling her empty belly.

Nora glanced around at the other colonists. They looked exhausted, hungry, and generally depressed. A couple of the men were nursing wounds from yesterday's attack. The colony had been attacked twice before.

After a few moments, Nora approached the counter and took the topmost tray. She held it up to scan its contents and found nothing objectionable. Satisfied with her choice, she stepped back out into the corridor and headed in the direction of the nearest hydroponic greenhouse.

Nora had volunteered to take this shift because she was good with electronics and had a knack for fixing things. But now, with the sun barely over the horizon, she needed to use every minute of daylight while it lasted. She hurried down the corridors and rounded a corner when a small drone popped up out of hiding near her feet. It scuttled forward, raising itself up on its spider legs. Its carapace glittered like polished silver as it raised a clawed hand at Nora in warning.",78.0,8,47.0,0.5625,0.421875
39,0.75,"The colony's central kitchen was a long, rectangular room filled with counters and sinks running along the walls and a single large serving table in the center. The floor was tile, and the ceiling had been painted white to reflect the morning sun. A row of walk-in cupboards stood at either end, stacked high with dishes and foodstuffs.

A few colonists were already there, sitting around the table drinking coffee. Nora joined them, grabbing a cup from one of the shelves. As she walked over to the counter and filled the cup with hot water, she watched two women chatting nearby. They wore the same utilitarian clothing as her, but theirs were slightly more fitted.

The taller woman caught sight of Nora, smiled, and said something that made the other woman laugh. The first woman waved goodbye, then turned back toward the table to finish what they'd been talking about.

Nora wasn't sure why she felt so awkward in her own skin. She liked people, especially friendly ones like these women. But it was hard not to feel exposed in her utility clothes. The fabric kept away the cold, but the seams left little to the imagination.

She took a deep breath to steady herself and reminded herself that she was safe for now. These women couldn't see through her clothes, and no one else had yet come into the kitchen.

The water boiled, and Nora lifted the steaming mug to her lips. Hot coffee flooded down her throat, and she sighed appreciatively. The bitter flavor woke up her taste buds and settled her stomach. The ache of hunger dulled.

She leaned over the counter, watching the women talk and laughing together. One of them, a short brunette with curly hair, glanced at Nora before she turned back to the other woman. She smiled when she saw Nora looking, then looked away again quickly.

The other woman noticed her attention, too. She flushed, said something, and laughed nervously. Her friend rolled her eyes, but she still chuckled. Then the taller woman spoke up, making the shorter woman look even more uncomfortable.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora mumbled to herself. ""It's just..."" She trailed off.",82.0,6,46.0,0.5625,0.421875
40,0.8,"The corridor outside the dormitories was lit by bright yellow lights strung along the ceiling like luminous vines, but the rest of the hallways were dark. The dimly glowing lights were too feeble to illuminate the dust that hung in every corner and crusted across the low overhead panels.

It made sense for a colony so far from human space to run on the same power grid that kept the cities of Earth running, but it was always odd to see such an advanced society fail to adopt modern conveniences.

In the distance, the steady rumble of machinery echoed through the complex. That was the source of the noise Nora had heard earlier when she woke up. She turned her head to peer down the dark corridor toward the command center. Her eyes adjusted enough to make out the faint glow of the monitors in the office at the end of the hall.

She passed the large dining room, where colonists ate communal meals together, and descended a long flight of stairs into the lower level of the building. The first floor was crowded with corridors leading away from the stairwell.

Nora headed down one hallway, passing darkened offices and empty conference rooms, until she found the door that led to the cafeteria. She pushed it open and stepped inside. The lights were off, but the table lamps glowed weakly and cast a dim red light over the deserted room. Nora moved forward to check out the food dispensers as she took stock of the other inhabitants.

The only person present was a man sitting in one corner. He sat slumped in his chair, staring at nothing. As Nora approached, he glanced at her with dull eyes and then looked away again. Nora knew him from the infirmary.

""Good morning,"" she said quietly. ""I'm here to get my breakfast.""

He didn't answer.

Nora sighed. She opened her menu and began scrolling through the selection of items available. The list was divided into three categories: proteins, carbohydrates, and fruits/vegetables. A healthy option for each category would give her more energy than just a sugary snack.

Protein options included meats such as beef and pork, along with various cuts of fish. Carbohydrate choices ranged from whole grains like bread to starchier foods like potatoes. Some vegetables were also listed as an option in the protein section.",94.0,8,45.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
41,0.8,"The dormitory hallway seemed darker than usual. The ceiling lights were off, and the walls glowed faintly blue-green in the faint light from the star outside. Sully was already at the entrance to the mess hall, where he stood chatting with a couple other colonists. He looked up when she came out of her room, smiled briefly, and nodded.

She passed him by without acknowledging his presence as she headed for the cafeteria and food.

The dining area had been built inside one of the largest greenhouses. A long table filled the entire space with enough room left over for several dozen seats. Several of the chairs had been shoved against the wall to accommodate tall tables. All around the perimeter of the greenhouse, shelves held dozens of glass pots holding seedlings in different stages of growth.

Nora sat at the end of the rightmost side of the long table and opened her plate with a practiced motion, setting it down next to her fork. She poured herself a cup of water from the pot beside her chair and took a slow drink while she waited for the meal to arrive.

The lights dimmed as the doors slid open. The first thing Nora noticed was the absence of any other colonists. Then, she spotted the cook and dishwasher coming through the swinging door. They both wore crisp white uniforms and stood aside to let a couple people pass them by before they entered the room.

Nora frowned as she watched them enter and take their places at the far end of the table. She was too early for breakfast, but it didn't matter; the kitchen crew were already serving themselves. As they did, one of them looked up. Their eyes met for just an instant. There was something wrong about the look on her face...

Something that made Nora pause with the fork halfway to her mouth.

Her instincts kicked in. In a single motion, Nora snatched her plate out of its place, turned away from the table, and fled into the hallway, dashing past Sully as she went.

""Nora!"" he called after her. ""Where are you going?""

She ignored him as she ran down the hall, heading toward the elevator.",78.0,6,47.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
42,0.8,"The hallway outside the door was dimly lit by recessed lights. The hum of machinery made it hard to hear over the background noise from the colony. It also reminded her of the first time she came through the main entrance. Then she was fresh out of school, anxious to prove herself as an engineer. Now she was responsible for keeping them alive on this desolate planet.

It seemed like a lifetime ago.

She passed several colonists, each going about their own business. Their faces were dark in shadow, illuminated only by the occasional gleam off reflective surfaces. They wore sleeveless shirts, long pants, and sandals instead of boots. They all looked up at her, some with surprised expressions, others with wary suspicion.

Nora frowned as they watched her pass. It wasn't fair that they should stare when she had to work so hard. She tried not to feel self-conscious and continued down the corridor. At the end, she stopped and turned to check in both directions. When there was no sign of any aliens lurking around the corner, Nora started again.

Her footsteps echoed faintly in the hall. It was cool outside now, but the air smelled sweet and clean in contrast to the stale reek of last night's dinner. The sun was rising beyond the foggy haze, casting faint highlights across the landscape. The ground underfoot crunched softly as she walked through crisp, dry grasses. Nora breathed deep and savored the fragrant wind.

She'd been out in this world before. Back on Earth. But only once. Her life hadn't turned out the way it was supposed to, so her parents moved her back home after high school. Then, when she came of age, they set her up with a job and some money to get started. It was the start of something good for her, but... well, that didn't matter anymore.

Ahead lay the main entrance, and Nora slowed to peer in through the glass doors that were bolted shut at all times. From inside, an automated voice spoke over the intercom, announcing the time and informing colonists of the day's schedule.

Nora frowned as she listened to it. This was a new schedule, and she needed to check and make sure it matched what Eve said the Company wanted.",83.0,5,48.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
43,0.8,"The walkway to the dormitories was lit by a single overhead bulb casting dim, harsh yellow illumination over the concrete. As she passed under it, Nora's eyes adjusted to the darkness. The dormitory buildings were dark, empty places now. After their morning shifts ended, colonists went home.

As she turned at the end of one long corridor, her footsteps echoing off the cold wall beside her, Nora looked up at the looming shadows cast by the towering cliff face. There was nothing else here but rock, metal, and dust.

The wind blew along her path, rippling her coat and rustling her hair. At the far end of the dormitory building, Nora heard the faint murmur of voices in the rec room.

She quickened her pace, walking faster and more confidently than she had since arriving on the planet. She held herself upright and confident, ready for anything. Her pulse raced with excitement and anticipation. Nora knew she was in the best shape possible.

Nora stopped as she reached the door to the communal showers. She leaned close to the opening, peering inside, waiting impatiently. A stream of water poured down from overhead pipes and splashed into a large basin, filling it. Nora waited patiently. It wasn't long before she could hear the hiss of steam rising above the sound of the shower.

As she pulled open the door, Nora glanced around the dim interior of the shower area. Steam swirled up in billowing clouds. A few colonists stood around the edge, looking out across the floor at the other end of the room. Some of them spoke softly to each other, and some just stared at the dark, damp wall opposite them. All were clad only in soiled clothes.

Nora stepped inside.

The heat shocked her skin, forcing her to pull her shirt over her head and peel off the jacket and utility pants. She tossed both items aside with a grimace. Nora winced as she peeled the thin fabric away from her body, exposing her bare torso to the chilly air.

She'd hoped to be able to get in a quick rinse and shower before starting her work shift. But that was impossible now; she'd have to wait until after her shift.",88.0,6,42.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
44,0.8,"The main dormitory area was at the end of the hallway from her room. The hall itself was long, but the rooms were narrow and crowded together. Each one had its own small bathroom near the entrance. On either side of the passage was a row of single-occupancy beds separated by privacy screens.

Nora moved through the hall, peering into each door. She reached the last room on the right. With a sigh she entered.

A quick glance around showed Nora a few other colonists sitting up in their bedding or lounging in the corner. No one else seemed to be awake yet. She stepped into the room, closing the door behind her. A faint, warm light came from the dimness of the ceiling fixtures. Nora felt like she was in a dark cave.

She turned back to face the door. She looked around, trying to get accustomed to the shadows and low light.

Nora frowned as her eyes adjusted. The overhead lights were off and no light seeped under the doors from the hall. She hadn't seen this before. Had there been a blackout or power failure? Was it the fault of the equipment? Or had the generator quit working? If so, when would the next supply ship arrive?

Nora's mind drifted back to her nightmares. Those creatures had killed more than one person. She didn't think she could sleep again tonight.

She walked toward the center of the room. There were three bunk beds set in a row. The other two bunks appeared vacant, but Nora sensed someone was nearby. She glanced over at the door to her right. The privacy screen was partially open and revealed only darkness beyond. She crept closer.

""Hello?"" Nora said tentatively. ""Anyone awake?""

There was no answer.

Nora sighed and sat on the edge of her bed, wondering what she should do with herself for the rest of the day. Maybe she'd better go see if anyone needed help.

Nora rose to her feet and crossed the room to pull the door open. She paused to peek outside, seeing no one. When she stepped out into the hall, the corridor was empty and dark.",83.0,5,50.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
45,0.8,"The walkway outside the dormitories was dimly lit by artificial lighting, but not so dark that Nora couldn't see the faces watching her as she walked. She smiled at them. The crew had made sure to wear their best smiles when they watched her pass, hoping for a glimpse of the woman who worked so hard to keep them alive.

She wasn't afraid anymore. But that didn't mean she wanted to be noticed by anyone. Not after seeing what happened to the last engineer who got too close.

The door slid open as Nora approached, revealing the same dingy room she'd seen in her dreams. Her breath caught as she gazed around, wondering how many more times this room would greet her eyes today. Then the reality of it crashed down on her again.

It was a filthy, dank space filled with stacked crates and rusted machinery. Nora looked up from her place near the far wall to avoid bumping into anything and shuddered. The pipes overhead dripped water. Steam escaped the vents along the walls in thick clouds. A faint yellow light flickered beneath the grating.

Nora's gaze wandered over the dirty, broken floor where the concrete had cracked underfoot. At least it was clean enough for her to see her own footprints.

The sound of the door sliding closed behind Nora startled her back into alertness. She turned, ready to demand a reason for shutting the door so quickly. Instead she found herself staring at another face, one with sad eyes and thin, pale skin. It belonged to a woman with dark hair gathered in a ponytail at the nape of her neck.

""Morning,"" Nora said. ""Did I wake you?""

The woman looked up with a wince. Her eyes were red and puffy from lack of sleep. When she spoke, her voice was hoarse. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb..."" She trailed off and shook her head. ""You're new. I've never seen anyone as nice as you before.""

She took a shaky breath and straightened up, nodding once.",65.0,5,45.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
46,0.8,"The dormitory hallways were quiet. Aside from the steady thump-thumping of the alarm, the building held a dead silence. Even the faint echo of Nora's boots as she walked echoed off the concrete walls like ghosts. The halls felt more like tunnels than rooms, narrow corridors cut through solid rock by the colonists' ingenuity and determination.

Nora reached the end of her hallway. A small room waited there—the communal kitchen, a place for gathering during the short break between shifts.

The door opened with a creak, spilling a stream of golden sunlight across the dusty floor. Nora squinted at the brightness, turning in slow circles while taking in the room.

""Hey,"" someone called softly as she turned to face the doorway. ""You're up early.""

A tall man stepped into view from around the corner, framed in brilliant yellow light. He wore the same type of clothing Nora did, though his jacket was black and fitted tight around the chest. His dark hair hung over one eye in a disheveled mop.

Nora recognized him, but he seemed so distant. So far away from her that it made no sense to say anything. She didn't even know what she wanted to say. Her gaze shifted down to the pistol holstered on his hip, then back up again.

""I don't think you should be wearing that outside your quarters, Nora,"" said the man.

Nora blinked in surprise and stepped forward. The man was smiling, but there was a hardness about him now, a coldness she hadn't seen before.

He's afraid...

She felt an odd twinge of fear herself when she realized this, like the world had suddenly become smaller, harder.

""Are you trying to give me a heart attack?"" Nora asked dryly, staring at the gun. She glanced past the stranger, looking around the kitchen. The room seemed so bright, the sun shining directly through the window.

The man shrugged. ""Do I look like a nutjob? You're the one who called my name.""

Nora bit her lip and nodded. ""Yeah, sorry. I just got up. What's going on out there?""

The man leaned against the doorframe.",82.0,5,47.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
47,0.8,"The morning chill was still cold from the night air, but a rising sun cast its warming rays across the land. The colony was surrounded by a few scraggly trees in scattered groves, their branches reaching high above to scrape against the stars. The air smelled like pine needles, not yet ripe enough to scent the dew on the ground.

Nora's boots crunched on the gravel of the main concourse. She walked down the middle of the open area, her footsteps echoing off the walls. On either side of the wide corridor were the other two wings of the colony; the dormitories stretched out to her right and the laboratories and power plant to her left.

The laboratories were at the end of the main concourse, separated from the rest of the colony by a thick layer of wall and windows. A security station stood at each end of the corridor that served as a checkpoint. But Nora wasn't worried about getting caught. Her access card allowed her through the checkpoints without trouble.

The doors to the labs were open when Nora arrived, so she let herself in and started to walk down the hallways inside. She glanced at her wristwatch. Her shift wouldn't start for another hour. She could get an early breakfast if she hurried.

Her boots made the familiar metallic thud of every step on the hard flooring. The corridor was dim with a soft glow lighting the way, casting long shadows from the overhead lights. It looked like a deserted town. Nora shivered. She couldn't imagine how anyone lived down here.

Nora followed the hallway down the stairs to the ground level. The large metal door marked the entrance to the power plant. Nora pushed it open and stepped into its light. The room was expansive, filled with towering, heavy machinery. Nora walked over to the nearest machine and peered at it.

It was a fusion reactor, but a much smaller one than the ones used in space stations. This device didn't produce the amount of energy necessary to run the colony. Instead, it provided a small fraction of the power needed to keep everything running.",87.0,6,45.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
48,0.8,"The corridor outside her dormitory looked like a minefield of tangled wires, exposed panels, and loose conduits. The dim lighting flickered as the power plant's reactor hummed, but it wasn't enough to illuminate the whole hallway.

Nora headed out of the dormitory toward the dining hall. After what she'd gone through yesterday, she hadn't expected to get much sleep last night.

But the colony had been up all night, trying to fix the power problem. She hoped they didn't get any more sleep today.

She passed other colonists heading the same way. Most of them nodded at her or spoke briefly. Nora returned the greetings with a casual wave as she hurried past. She couldn't waste time chatting when her first job was fixing one of the power plants.

The sun rose higher in the sky, chasing away lingering fog from the previous day. By midmorning, the temperature began to rise, and the humidity increased to make clothes stick to skin. But Nora's hair dried quickly in the warm breeze.

At lunchtime, the din of people talking, eating, and arguing filled the corridors. She followed a trail of food wrappers to the mess hall. A few familiar faces sat around the tables, including several of the younger engineers who had worked on the power plant.

""Hey,"" someone called as Nora entered. ""There you are.""

A tall man with dark black hair stood up and waved to her. Nora smiled in recognition. The man's name was Joe O'Grady, the Chief Engineer for the power plant. Nora knew him because she'd been his assistant back when she was a kid. He didn't wear his engineering hat anymore, but she could see it on the shelf behind him.

O'Grady led Nora over to the table. ""I thought I recognized your voice!"" he said.

Nora shook hands with her former mentor. ""How have things been going?""

""Oh, great. We're getting close to fixing the power problem. No more night shifts. And they say we might get another ship in next week or two.""

Nora frowned. ""I guess this is what you call 'good news.' There's always something wrong. Maybe a month from now there won't be any power at all.""

""Not unless someone comes up with a miracle,"" O'Grady said.",88.0,5,44.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
49,0.8,"The corridor outside was dimly lit, a few meters wide, and full of doors on both sides. The lights were low, but they worked just fine when the batteries weren't depleted. There was plenty of room to walk side by side without bumping shoulders.

Nora stopped at the end of her hall, opened one of the many doors, and stepped out onto a narrow ramp. It led up to the next level. The other residents had already left for work, leaving Nora to trudge through the cold air alone.

The colony's corridors were set apart from each other by several floors in height. The upper levels didn't have windows, but were still bright and filled with activity. They contained labs, manufacturing facilities, and power plants. These uppermost levels also held apartments where the colonists lived in privacy and comfort while on duty.

At ground level, Nora walked along a short corridor lined with storage lockers. She passed a few empty rooms until she reached the garage area, then turned right and entered another small hallway that ended at a large door marked ""Bathroom."" The room inside was cramped and utilitarian, but better than most of the rooms in the colony. The floor was metal grating, not carpet. The walls were covered with a metallic mesh. A few potted shrubs grew in the corners.

Nora went straight to the sink and washed her face before stepping into the tiny shower cubicle. Water pounded from overhead nozzles. Nora quickly lathered herself and rinsed off under the scalding spray, which doused the sweat and dirt clinging to her body.

After toweling dry, she dressed in fresh clothes from the locker beside the shower stall. She grabbed a towel and headed back out, then stepped into a long, dimly lit corridor filled with doors. Each room was smaller than the one she'd just left, barely big enough for two beds, dressers, and a couple of desks, but they were all clean.",100.0,7,46.0,0.6400000000000001,0.5120000000000001
50,0.85,"The dim hallway of the dormitories looked like every other hall in this sprawling, cramped colony: a line of doors leading off in both directions. Each door held a simple rectangular window letting in the soft light of morning as well as sound of footsteps echoing faintly on the grated floor.

In each room, someone was awake and moving about—though not too early for Nora's tastes—and the faint sounds of clattering utensils and muttering voices came from within. The clatter of pots and pans echoed up the corridor at intervals while Nora passed.

At the far end, where most corridors ended, she reached a large glassed-in control center with multiple work stations set around it. A long table took up one side with several chairs. A bank of thick monitors lined the wall on either side, displaying images of the terrain outside. At the head of the table sat a woman in a black leather jacket and trousers.

She wore an unadorned white button-up shirt and red suspenders over her utilitarian pants. She had dark brown hair cropped short on top and a sharp angular face with thin, straight eyebrows meeting above a piercing, intelligent green eye.

Nora smiled when the woman turned to look at her.""Good morning, Rana,""she said as she walked toward her. Rana grinned back and gestured to the empty seats.

They exchanged greetings in the same language Nora's grandparents used, which was their native tongue. It was one of many languages spoken on this colony. The Company wanted to make sure they could communicate with any potential future colonists. But Nora preferred the English she learned from Earth, so she spoke it only in private.

The two women took a seat and chatted for a moment before Rana returned to the front of the room. Her voice was deep and melodious, like a soothing song. The words were accented, though. She had been born on another planet.""We have reports of malfunctioning systems throughout the camp, but it looks like the main computer is still working fine,""Rana said. She ran a hand along her neck and down over her shoulders.""And your shift is off today, Nora. I hope you've had some time to rest.""""Yes, thanks to you,""Nora replied with a smile.",75.0,7,46.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
51,0.85,"As she emerged, two men were just setting up breakfast. The kitchen lights turned their faces ruddy in the early morning gloom, and Nora recognized both of them from the work shifts she'd seen. She gave a small wave as she walked by.

The two men responded in kind, but they were distracted; one of them had a clipboard propped on the counter, and the other was talking to Sully. Nora knew he was the colony's primary administrator because she could hear him clearly over the hum of the equipment.

She paused at the doorway to listen.

""... not see why I have to take over this engineering department,"" a man said. ""I'm good enough to run my own crew.""

Sully chuckled. ""Well, you are good enough. Just don't let your ego get in the way of the job. You're here for management experience, remember?""

""Oh, sure. And I know everything there is about the systems, but nobody tells me what those damn machines actually do. They only tell me what they can do—not how!""

A woman joined them. She was a dark-skinned Latina with short black hair and large brown eyes. Her voice was gentle and warm, and she smiled at Sully. ""Carmichael? Is this where we find the chief engineer?""

Nora blinked in surprise, having completely forgotten about her. A grin spread across her face as recognition dawned. ""Hola! Señorita Rodriguez. You work down in the plant?""

The young woman nodded. ""Yes, I'm a mechanic. My name's Maria Rodriguez.""

""We were just catching up,"" Carmichael said. He waved to Nora and grinned again. ""I'm glad you got off early, Nora. How about some breakfast with us? We'll have fresh rolls and coffee ready in five minutes if you're hungry.""

""Sounds great,"" she said. She glanced over her shoulder at the two men. One of them looked at her, his lips twitching upward into a smile.

""And don't worry about anything,"" Sully added. ""We'll keep you safe while you're working.",75.0,4,46.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
52,0.85,"She felt better when she put on shoes, but still wanted to be prepared if a repair job needed boots. The walk to the dining hall wasn't long, so she made good time.

At the end of the hallway, she found the community's main food supply in the form of a large central building. Past this was a small courtyard that offered access to the kitchen, greenhouses, power plant, garage, and dormitories. In the distance, through a gap in a nearby cliff face, Nora caught sight of the sun rising above the mountains.

Nora smiled as she stepped into the communal dining room. She'd gotten used to seeing her companions there, even though she didn't eat regularly. The other colonists had been surprised at first, then quickly embraced their new engineer. They laughed at Nora's jokes and helped her with mechanical repairs. Some were friendly in a brotherly way, others reserved for business reasons. But they welcomed her, even if she was the only woman on the planet.

A quick glance around the busy dining hall showed that most colonists would be sitting down to breakfast soon. As she passed the buffet line, Nora glanced at the wide selection of foods lined up on a cart near the entrance. Eggs, pancakes, fried potatoes, bacon, sausage, cereal, and more. She sighed in satisfaction, taking out a plate from one of the counters where a couple of workers polished silverware as she headed to the line.

In addition to being the best-engineer in the colony, Nora also happened to be very skilled at making friends. That was probably why the Company assigned her to this project. The colonists liked working with her. It helped that she made people feel safe and comfortable.

Her efforts paid off here, as did the fact that Nora could always rely on another's help when she needed it. People were always happy to lend a hand, and Nora knew how to get it back if she repaid them in kind.",68.0,7,47.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
53,0.85,"The colony's halls were dimly lit in red emergency lights. The air smelled stale from disuse. At least the colonists had learned to use the communal showers, she reminded herself.

As she walked the length of the hallways, she came upon a handful of people heading in different directions. Everyone carried a tool pouch or satchel over their shoulders. These colonists weren't quite up yet, but there wasn't time to wait around for them.

Nora moved at the front of the crowd, her boots scuffing slightly on the synthetic carpeting. The hallways were narrow, so when the colonists crowded too close together they became one file. As a result, Nora had to duck under arms and limbs as she squeezed past them. It seemed an endless crawl.

The walk took longer than she expected due to her own inattentiveness, but soon the sounds of other people talking and the smell of food drifted through the corridors. After a few more turns, she reached another set of doors that opened into the cafeteria.

This section of the colony was fully equipped with a dining hall and kitchen for catering large gatherings. The room buzzed with talk, laughter, and clanging pots. A group of men gathered outside the stove while three women clustered around it in heated discussion. In between, a young man sat slumped in his chair, head on his chest, snoring quietly.

Nora turned right and followed the line of colonists out into the hall again. She walked past the wide central concourse, which ran across the length and breadth of the colony. As she rounded the corner, she passed an open doorway where a woman leaned against one wall. Nora slowed her steps as she approached.

The woman's dark hair and black eyes were just like Nora's, but there was something about the way she held herself, arms folded and leaning back against the doorframe, that made her stand out in the crowd. The woman watched Nora from the corner of her eye with an intent stare.

Nora paused when she drew near enough to see the woman more clearly. The woman wore a plain grey jumpsuit that bore the name tag'Rosa'. Her shoulders hunched, and her head cocked slightly at an awkward angle. There was no telling how long this woman had been standing in place, staring into space. A few other colonists were passing in the opposite direction, but they didn't notice Rosa.",80.0,7,47.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
54,0.85,"Downstairs, she found Sully already at the table in the communal kitchen eating what looked like a slice of toast with jam and orange juice poured over it.

""What are you doing up?"" Sully asked, blinking bleary eyes. He set his toast aside, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and pointed to his stomach. ""I'm still hungry.""

Nora grimaced. She hated mornings. The whole routine was suffocatingly regimented. And the food wasn't bad... but it was also bland, and always the same.

She sat across from him, taking a deep breath. There were things to do. She sighed again as she grabbed her own fork.

This morning's meal was an omelet made with nutrient broth, some type of protein concentrate, egg yolk, and salt—all cooked into the eggs before serving. It was the only thing they got that might be considered edible, so it tasted pretty good most of the time, and today Nora liked how fresh and full her belly felt.

Nora glanced around the crowded room, looking for someone else. She couldn't see anyone.

Sully nodded toward her plate with a faint smile. ""Don't forget your breakfast.""

She blinked and took another bite. She didn't feel very hungry, but the smell of the food had awakened something in her stomach. She chewed slowly and swallowed before nodding agreement.

""Thanks,"" she said around a mouthful of egg and toast, which was actually pretty good.

Sully nodded absently and returned to his own breakfast, while Nora finished hers off and washed up. With a sigh she pulled her hair back into a ponytail. As she tied it with her belt, Nora realized Sully wasn't there anymore.

She looked around and caught sight of him walking down the hall toward the front door. When he reached it, he paused, and turned to look at her over his shoulder. She could barely make out the expression on his face as he lifted one hand in farewell. Nora sighed again, exasperated by her partner's habit of leaving before she woke up.",63.0,5,44.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
55,0.85,"The hallways were dim and shadowed, though the floors were well-lit. The walls and ceiling were gray metallic plates bolted together in a complex honeycomb design. On either side of the hallway, small rectangular recessed openings allowed narrow corridors to the right and left of each wall. The spaces were about two meters wide, but only slightly taller than a man. Most were filled with storage lockers and service areas for the colonists' needs.

Nora passed through the open door at the end of her own corridor. She walked out onto the front porch, where she shivered as wind whipped across her face. Fog hovered over the ground like the ghosts of old wars, swirling around the bases of large rocks that protruded from the dirt.

""Morning,"" Nora greeted the colony manager, who was already waiting at the edge of one of these boulders. His name was John Stebbings. ""You're up early.""

""Not so early as you are."" He grinned. ""I got myself a cup of coffee while I waited. Want some?""

Nora smiled back. ""Sure.""

Stebbings handed her his steaming mug. She took it gratefully, inhaling deeply before taking a sip and wrinkling her nose in distaste. ""What is this? I'd swear it's battery acid if not for the sugar.""

He laughed. ""It's a mixture of caffeine and sugar. Keeps me awake. A little bitter, but worth the price. And don't worry. You'll get used to it. That said, we have more than enough for everyone here.""

She grunted. ""I'm not worried about that. More about the lack of food. I'll be lucky if my stomach doesn't revolt on me. Or worse, growl like an angry bear. What's that supposed to mean?""

Stebbings shook his head. ""Never mind. It'll keep. Don't forget your ration card."" He gestured toward a small pouch hanging around Nora's neck.

Nora paused in reaching up to take the card. ""My rations? For breakfast? But I had lunch yesterday.""

""Yeah,"" he said. ""Well... it's not like you're going hungry. We've got plenty of food in the storage units—we just don't want any of it to spoil.""

Her eyes narrowed.",87.0,4,44.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
56,0.85,"Nora's legs felt like jelly when she left her room, but by the time she made it to the communal kitchen, she found herself moving with purpose. Her footsteps echoed off walls of hard surfaces in empty corridors, and a sense of cold pervaded the entire colony. But the colony's power plant still ran, so no lights were out.

The dining hall was packed to capacity. There wasn't even enough room for her to squeeze through. Nora picked up a tray and took a seat at one of the long tables. Several colonists passed her food, and they exchanged a nod or a wave. They were all busy with their own tasks. No one noticed her.

Nora ate quickly. By the time she finished, her stomach rumbled loudly enough to draw curious looks. It was true. The colonists were hungry; Nora could smell it in the air.

The hallways had been designed to be self-sufficient, including a vast network of pipes that distributed water and collected wastes. As she returned to her room, Nora noted how clean and well-maintained the infrastructure was. That was unusual, as the Company often overlooked maintenance. Even with a fully automated colony, someone should check on systems and equipment regularly.

She walked past a pair of engineering bays to an unoccupied set of doors. One of the large rooms was empty. Nora entered and closed the door behind her, then took a seat at the console. A thin layer of dust covered its surface. The room was dark. Nora waited for her eyes to adjust. After a few seconds, the display flickered into life, casting an orange glow over rows of switches and controls.

She pressed a control marked with a green circle. With a soft hum and a low whine, a massive power loader lowered itself from overhead and settled onto one of the floor's raised sections. The loader contained sophisticated motors, electronics, and hydraulics. Though they were heavy to move manually, it was simple to operate with a small touch screen. Nora stepped inside, sat down, and tapped the monitor to activate her loaders controls.

The loader began moving across the ground in slow jerky movements as Nora navigated through its menus. She paused when she found a submenu labeled 'load,' which allowed her to specify items and materials she wanted moved around. She searched through available options until she found what she was looking for.",80.0,7,43.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
57,0.85,"The colony's main dining hall was open to the airy, windowless space at the heart of the complex. This central chamber was the site of community meetings, lectures, social gatherings, banquets, weddings... and breakfasts. All meals were communal affairs; colonists worked in shifts throughout the day to keep everyone fed. The Colony was divided into three different work schedules, one for each of the eight-hour periods. Breakfast always ran twenty minutes behind schedule because of the constant interruptions.

Nora crossed the corridor, following the noise to the breakfast room, and stood in line for a meal she rarely wanted to eat but felt obliged to take anyway. On her way back to her quarters, she passed through the small training gymnasium. Most of the time, this space was empty. It had served as an exercise area and meeting place when Presley's Promise was still under construction, but since its completion it had been relegated to storage.

Nora turned down the hallway toward her apartment. As usual, a few colonists lingered outside her door, waiting for their turns to use the communal shower. Nora had just stepped into the hall when the familiar sound of boots crunching gravel jerked her attention away from the other residents.

She stopped in place and peered around the corner at the intruder's approach. A tall man strode purposefully toward her with determined steps. He wore the same utilitarian uniform as Nora, and his dark hair was neatly parted on the left side above a broad forehead. His face was lean and clean shaven, though he'd left some stubble along his jawline to make him look more rugged.

He nodded brusquely in greeting. ""Good morning, Engineer Decker.""

""Mornin',"" she replied automatically. Her gaze roved over the stranger's body as she tried to remember who he was. In a flash, she realized. This was Sully Carmichael, the colony administrator and Chief Engineer, the person responsible for keeping everything working properly.

Sully always made her nervous.",92.0,9,42.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
58,0.85,"The corridor was empty, as usual. As she approached the cafeteria, Nora heard voices drifting down from a high-ceilinged room just past the hall juncture—the colonists' recreation center.

Nora was surprised when she saw Sully standing outside the doorway, smiling and chatting with a young woman named Tessa. Her dark brown hair hung long over both shoulders like a curtain. She wore a white sleeveless tank top that showed off the curves of her toned arms and biceps. Nora guessed she was somewhere in her mid twenties with a small, neat nose, full lips, and wide eyes.

Sully must be dating now, Nora thought. He was always talking about Tessa, but she never let herself get too invested. It seemed like something he might do, but it wasn't fair to make assumptions about what his life had become. Nora knew firsthand how lonely this place could be, after spending so many months on the ground.

Nora hesitated. She wanted to ask him if she could use the bathroom first, then joined him and Tessa in the cafeteria. But the moment stretched into awkward silence as Nora struggled to find an opening to bring up her concerns.

Tessa glanced at her watch. ""Oh! I've got to run."" The girl smiled reassuringly. ""See you later!"" she said, breezing past Sully and heading down the hallway.

""I'll meet you guys there,"" Sully called after her. As Tessa hurried off, he turned to look for Nora again.

""Hey, Nora,"" he said. ""That's really nice of you to help out with the colony today.""

""It's no problem.""

""You want a ride back?""

Nora hesitated. ""Um, yeah.""

Sully frowned as he scanned the hall. ""It should be pretty easy to catch from here. I'll just head straight home. See you soon, okay?""

Nora nodded and watched him leave before she headed into the restroom to freshen up.",71.0,5,44.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
59,0.85,"The corridor outside looked like any other on this side of the colony's main dome. She passed small laboratories, where colonists worked tirelessly at their tasks, and power plants that converted natural gas from pockets around the colony to electric current. The corridors were mostly dark, except for a few dim lamps lighting the way for people hurrying through the colony.

A few meters from the central dome, Nora slowed, catching sight of a familiar shape in the shadows. Her heart jumped as she walked toward it, knowing exactly what she was about to find.

Beside the stairs leading up to the command center sat an ancient power loader.

No one had seen fit to tell Nora that her best friend was dead. Her parents told her he was injured but would recover when they returned home from their mission. Nora found the silence awkward, even after so many days of working beside him. He'd been her first engineer, her only ally in the harsh isolation of Presley's Promise.

Nora's fingers tightened on the railing and paused a few steps short of the old machine. She forced herself to step forward, ignoring the heat that crept through her body and into her face. She stood beside the machine, feeling its rusted metal skin beneath her fingers. It was too hot to touch without discomfort, but the warmth made it seem almost alive.

With a sigh, Nora stepped away and pulled open the door. The air inside the chamber felt cool as she shut the door behind her and walked down the corridor to the garage. Inside, the loader's wide, armored doors were closed. Nora climbed the ladder, stepping through a hatch in the top of the loader. Her feet clanged loudly on the platform as she stopped, staring at the strange device.

It was like nothing she'd ever seen before.

The loader sat inside a cavernous bay. It looked large enough to accommodate several of the colony's ground vehicles. Atop the bay, cables hung from an iron grid, while a long, snaking umbilical extended out one end.

The other end of the loader jutted into the gloom beyond Nora's field of vision. Its curved end terminated in a thick, bulbous tube that swelled into the darkness.",75.0,7,41.0,0.7224999999999999,0.6141249999999999
60,0.9,"On the landing outside the dormitory, she felt a sudden change in the air temperature as the breeze died. The atmosphere was noticeably cold, making her toes feel like they were frozen in place. She shivered slightly but fought the impulse to rub warmth back into them. With a deep breath, she started down the hall toward the communal showers.

When the lights flickered off at the end of the hall, Nora instinctively slowed to let other colonists pass her. The dim illumination cast shadows across her path and obscured what might be lurking on either side. It also made the corridor appear dark and sinister.

The faint glimmering from the next set of rooms didn't alleviate that impression. As she approached the flickering glow, Nora's foot caught on a loose floor tile and sent her stumbling forward. She regained balance with the added help of a wall. Without pausing to assess if it was safe, Nora stepped around the corner into the first room.

It wasn't completely dark, so long as she faced away from the light. Light streamed in from a window high up on one wall and a door beside it. She could hear the low hum of an electric current through the ceiling, indicating power lines or equipment running on backup batteries.

A single, bright point of orange light sat atop a metal desk. An oil lamp burned like the sun overhead. Its heat warmed her face.",61.0,7,41.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
61,0.9,"At the end of the long hall, she paused in front of a door labeled 'Dining Hall' and opened it slowly to peer inside. The room was nearly empty. A few colonists milled about and ate at round tables near the far wall where a handful of servers passed food around. Her fellow engineers clustered together near one corner where four more workers stood by waiting to serve them.

She entered the dining area. There was just enough time to take a quick cup of coffee before the workday began.

The serving girl's face turned toward her, but when Nora saw her eyes the girl smiled instead. Nora returned the smile tentatively, her heart pounding fast. For a moment, she forgot what she'd come to do.

Nora found a table that wasn't already occupied. She set down her coffee cup and sat, still trying not to stare at the server. She kept seeing the eyes of the dead men lying in a bloody pile back in her quarters.

A server placed food on the tabletop. As Nora reached for it, she realized she didn't know how much the meal cost. It probably cost a lot. But right now her budget was only limited by a few hundred dollars, most of which was already spent on necessities like food and rent.

Nora dug into the breakfast before her. The meal consisted of eggs, fried potatoes, bacon, bread with butter, and warm milk. After eating, she drank the last sips from her coffee cup.

A server approached again. ""You ready to start your shift?"" he asked.

""I am.""",72.0,5,44.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
62,0.9,"Down the hall, another engineer stood by the door to the mess hall. His head jerked up at her approach, face reddening in recognition, then he rushed across the room to open it. As she entered, Nora could smell the familiar mix of eggs, bacon, fresh-brewed coffee, and buttery toast wafting through the air. The low hum of conversation fell silent at Nora's entrance. She looked around the tables where colonists sat, eating quietly while they waited for their portions. Some stared at her as she walked down the center aisle between them, others watched her curiously from the edges of the crowd.

The sound of plates banging together as people moved through the line caught her attention, and Nora turned to see a young man filling his plate. He was dressed like many of the colonists—a pair of jeans and a plaid button-up shirt under a long coat. But his outfit looked better cared for than most. Nora studied him as he placed the plate on top of one that already held food and handed it off to someone behind him.

He glanced over his shoulder, noticing Nora as she approached. She paused in front of him with her back to him, not sure what to do next. This was the first time she had seen another person since arriving here. Her face remained blank, but she couldn't stop herself from glancing down at the plate.

With practiced motions, Nora took a forkful of the scrambled eggs she loved so much. She popped it in her mouth, chewing vigorously as she stared at the man. His features were sharp and attractive enough. The angular bones of his nose gave his forehead an unusual prominence.",85.0,7,44.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
63,0.9,"She descended a winding stairwell that connected the dormitory to the central engineering area below. Here, she found a small dining hall with three long tables occupied by colonists eating food. Many of them were men; they sat close together in a clique while women ate alone at the far end. In contrast to the well-worn uniforms worn for every other task, these people wore crisp and neat lab coats that looked brand new.

As Nora passed through the dining area, the diners paused from their meals to stare at her. A few stared openly, but most seemed confused and uncertain of why she was there.

For a moment she considered going back up to her room to grab some breakfast, but the idea of lingering near the table filled her with an urgent need for nourishment that drove her forward.

The kitchen, where Nora first encountered the alien drones, felt cramped despite the cavernous dimensions compared to what she expected. The wide doors opened to an enclosed chamber that held rows of work stations and storage racks alongside a large cooking hearth. But it wasn't just the size that surprised her.

It was how busy everything in here seemed to be. Food processors chugged, conveyors hummed, and robotic arms handled dozens of tasks at once. A crew of four people worked efficiently in the midst of the chaos, their faces grim and their expressions tired.

Nora stepped past a conveyor belt and into the crowded space. As she pushed through the swarm of workers, Nora made eye contact with two of them. They didn't return her gaze; they stared at her with glazed, vacant eyes. Nora's breath caught as she noticed something new.",85.0,7,45.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
64,0.9,"A few other colonists were awake at this early hour too, making for a long line at the communal bathroom. Nora glanced around as she passed them, but no one seemed to notice her. Her new friend had said they didn't talk much when they met, which explained the cold glances everyone gave her.

She couldn't blame them. Not after the last six months of working for these people without pay, eating their food, and having nothing to do with anyone. At first, Nora tried to fit in like everybody else, doing what needed to be done until someone got tired of her. But then the Company started giving her work that required a little more thinking and planning. And that meant learning how to interact with people, something that was difficult for an engineer who preferred machines.

The colony's cafeteria looked even emptier than usual this morning. Nora sat down at the end of the empty table and picked up a plate, wondering if there was anything left from yesterday's meal. A warm, soft voice sounded behind her.""You're back,""said Sully, sliding onto his chair beside her. He smiled.""I can tell.""""Hi,""she replied sheepishly as she dug into the porridge piled high on her plate. It smelled fresh, so it must have been made just that morning. Nora sighed and sipped her watery coffee, letting the bitter brew soothe her throat.

Sully watched her eat before speaking again.""How are you feeling today? I saw you went right to sleep after dinner.""Nora stopped midchew. The way he'd phrased that question made her feel... vulnerable. She swallowed, trying not to think too hard about why that might make her uncomfortable.",65.0,6,46.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
65,0.9,"The halls were filled with colonists heading for the communal dining hall. Most wore coveralls like Nora, though few seemed to be wearing the latest fashion trends. Nora liked the old fashioned way people dressed out here. The uniforms let her know she was in a colony full of friends and neighbors.

When Nora entered the dining room, people sat at tables eating cereal while others chatted around a long table. They smiled greetings as Nora passed them. Everyone knew everyone else here; they'd come together when the Company brought the settlement to life and worked hard and cooperatively to get everything working as smoothly as possible.

The communal kitchen was set up on one side of the hall, so Nora could grab whatever food needed for break time quickly if she wasn't going to make it back in time. Some colonists joked about that; since most equipment couldn't take any power draw at all, this was something of an advantage. But most engineers preferred to be efficient rather than convenient.

Nora headed toward the kitchen, passing a wide array of open cupboards with neatly labeled containers inside. She scanned the labels. As much as she wanted to indulge in fresh fruits and pastries, her hunger won out over laziness and she took a jar of jam from the shelf. Jam was almost universally appreciated by people in this region because it kept well even without refrigeration, and despite the scarcity of other supplies the colonists weren't stingy with their fruit preserves.

While the kitchen might have been large enough to feed a small city, it looked no bigger than her average apartment back home. Nora grabbed a knife and a bowl for peeling fruit before heading through the door into the rest of the communal area.

A few paces down the hall were two large, glass-walled recreation rooms that had been converted into lounges to accommodate more colonists in smaller groups. In this room there were several tables arranged across the floor and along one wall. A group of three engineers sat talking at one of the long tables.",60.0,9,50.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
66,0.9,"The first hall she passed opened up at right angles, forming a large crossroads where a series of halls led off in different directions. At its center was the dormitory.

The colony's dining hall wasn't much to look at, but it was big enough. More than a hundred people could crowd inside. The ceiling high above arched over the room and supported a grid of pipes that ran the length of the place. Each pipe spanned the width of three men, lined up like soldiers. In the center of the room stood a row of servers set to one side. These servers were connected to other stations at each end of the hall. One of these terminals rested on Nora's right shoulder, while another sat atop her head on the left.

Nora leaned in close to peer up through the glass countertop. Below, rows of dark green boxes waited for orders. A wide, thin window divided the front from the back. The windows were fitted with thick rubber seals and smoked heavily when they rippled in the breeze.

She looked down at the terminal on her shoulder. It read: ""Dormitory 1, Nora Decker.""

Below the words, an arrow pointed up the corridor, toward the dormitories. To the right of this, a tiny menu bar displayed a few options. The only word visible was ""Breakfast"".

The server hummed as she scrolled menus. Her fingers tapped impatiently.",90.0,6,48.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
67,0.9,"A cold wind blew through the empty spaces. The colonists were not yet awake, but soon they'd begin the daily routine as Nora walked among the dark dormitories and barracks. They would be heading to their shifts at the power plant, engineering bay, mess hall, medical clinic, cafeteria, and a dozen other locations scattered around the complex.

Nora's footsteps echoed loudly in the vast space. She saw a few groups of workers hurrying towards the mess halls, though many more loitered aimlessly like Nora. Some sat alone on their beds. Others slept. Most simply watched the bleak landscape from within the narrow confines of their bunks, staring vacantly at nothing.

Nora turned back to her quarters, taking slow steps as she headed for the common showers and bathrooms down each hallway. A wave of exhaustion swept over her. She felt it coming on as she took in the stark scene outside her window, thinking of her warm bed and hot shower ahead of her.

She stopped dead in her tracks and spun about. In one swift motion, Nora unsnapped her utility belt, kicked off her shoes, and swung herself through the nearest air vent.

Her mind screamed to turn and run, but adrenaline pushed aside every logical impulse. Now or never, thought Nora as she plunged through cold darkness into the maze of pipes. As she squeezed past a narrow gap, Nora felt something touch her leg just above her knee and gave a sharp yelp as pain shot up her spine.

But it wasn't a predator that had touched her; the sensation was from the loose electrical wiring dangling beneath the ceiling. She twisted around awkwardly, still clinging to the metal conduit. There wasn't enough room in the cramped passage for her to squeeze out again and there were no more gaps between pipes to swing by.",80.0,7,39.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
68,0.9,"At least the hallways were empty, unlike the halls filled with colonists at the end of their shifts, hurrying to meet the first transports loaded with supplies from the last supply ship. This morning, the only people awake at this early hour were the few night-shift workers on the engineering teams who didn't yet know what they'd be working on.

Nora walked the narrow walkway between rows of double doors leading to the various bays. The corridors echoed with low voices coming from behind closed doors as she passed.

A large door in the hallway stood ajar, revealing an open space full of tall, bulky equipment and tools. A man in a white uniform watched her pass, nodding politely.

The main hangar bay was also deserted, lit by harsh lights that cast shadows everywhere. Nora glanced around to make sure no one else was nearby, then slipped outside. She stepped cautiously around a corner into another corridor and took off down it with purposeful steps toward the power plant. She arrived just as the day shift began walking in with clipboards in hand, each of them wearing a red company vest over their coveralls. Nora waved to the group, but kept going toward her workplace.

""Hey,"" one said, ""Are you heading back after your break?""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah.""

""I'm gonna grab breakfast first—can I walk with you?""

Nora hesitated, but then shrugged. ""Sure.""

""What are you up to this morning?"" a second asked when the first one paused beside Nora.

""Going out for a bite, I think.""

""Huh,"" the second responded.

Nora followed the line of the corridor until she saw her destination ahead; a large metal door set into the base of a cliff wall. It was marked with the Company logo and painted black. Nora studied it for a moment, trying to remember if the doors were usually locked or unlocked.

The two engineers came abreast of her again.",80.0,6,43.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
69,0.9,"At first glance the colony appeared like any other small industrial complex: utilitarian structures lining straight paths between rocky hills, each one housing the families who called them home. But where others saw smooth walls and flat floors, Nora caught glimpses of ragged gaps in the flooring. She'd seen the same thing when she visited her mother's family on Earth, where the foundations had always been crumbling. This was only to be expected in a frontier colony built on shifting sands, but it didn't make the view less disquieting.

But Nora wasn't thinking about the foundation of the colony. The reality of her situation lay deeper than that. And she wouldn't let herself look beyond the here and now, because if she stopped looking there was no place to go.

She headed for the mess hall. At least food tasted better in this environment. Maybe it was the dust or grit in their mouths from working outside, but most colonists preferred not to risk choking on sand as they ate. So despite the gritty flavor of the unidentifiable stew sloshing in its bowls, Nora found herself savoring the taste and texture on her tongue.

After washing her face at a sink beside the showers, she passed through the greenhouses on her way to the command center to begin her shift. As she walked she watched her feet squish underfoot and marveled again at the strange, rugged land beneath them.",82.0,9,45.0,0.81,0.7290000000000001
70,0.95,"The hallways were dark under the heavy layer of dust. She reached for the overhead lights but missed, bumping into someone else in the process. ""Oh! Excuse me!""

""Not like you're not always knocking your head against something,"" said a familiar voice. The speaker was Sully Carmichael, the colony's main administrator. He nodded back at her as he straightened up from where she'd banged into him.

Nora smiled. ""You know it.""

He flashed that bright white smile of his. Nora had known Sully for years; they were friends but also working partners. And she respected the man. She liked his easy manner, his willingness to engage, even as it kept him distant.

Sully gestured with one hand toward their shared bathroom. ""Shall we?""

Nora checked herself in the mirror. Her hair was still tangled and her face red from sleep. She gave the tousled mess a shake and fluffed out her hair, then pulled on a fresh pair of boots over sweatpants that matched the utilitarian color scheme of the rest of her clothing. After a final glance into the mirror, Nora took the lead, reaching for the doorknob beside the large door set in front of them. ""Mmhm.""

The doors parted on an empty corridor beyond the room. On a planet this far from any other human community, it made sense to keep rooms physically separated. One could stay warm without disturbing the others. And if one was sleeping alone, there would be no unwanted contact.

Still, despite the advantages of this arrangement, Nora preferred having people around when she slept. It helped remind her that they were all she had left after losing everyone else. If the Company didn't return soon, Nora might be alone forever. The thought sent goose bumps rising along her arms.

Nora paused for a moment and looked up at Sully, who stood just inside the opening. His smile vanished with his next words. ""Do I have to tell you again?""",81.0,5,42.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
71,0.95,"The colony had only recently been built. Its infrastructure was already a patchwork mess of cables, conduits, and plastic tubing strewn around every surface, mostly obscured by a thick layer of dust. Nora strode briskly toward the communal dining hall, careful to keep an eye open for debris. The air smelled stale with grease and machine oil.

She slipped inside through a side door. Nora stopped just beyond the doorway to let her eyes adjust to the gloom, which revealed rows of empty tables to either side of a large serving line. In front of the line sat two automated food dispensers and several young people waiting on them.

An artificial intelligence controlled everything at Presley's Promise except the colonists themselves. Eve is always polite, even when she has something unpleasant to tell you. Nora imagined that being polite could be difficult under stress, but it was likely preferable to telling you ""no"" instead of whatever nasty answer Eve might have given.

Eve made sure each meal came in a container with its own water source so the colonists didn't go thirsty. That also meant meals took longer than they otherwise would, which Nora found inconvenient since she preferred a hot breakfast as soon as possible after rising for the day.

When Nora got closer to the serving line, she caught sight of her own name floating above one of the plates on a long table. She smiled and began walking toward it, then stopped short. A figure was sprawled across her plate, right where Nora had set down her utensils to dig into some bread rolls smothered in gravy.

The dead body wasn't fresh. It smelled like sour rot and moldy earth, not of chemicals or decomposition, but a far more primal scent. Nora's hand curled into a fist. ""Eve.""

Eve responded, without any expression whatsoever, ""Yes, Nora Decker?""

Nora jerked her attention from the corpse back to the AI. Its blank face did nothing to calm her rising anxiety. She clenched her jaw until her teeth ached. ""What happened?""

""A drone entered your colony in search of food,"" Eve answered. ""It encountered a large quantity of human blood spilled on a hydroponic row.",67.0,8,40.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
72,0.95,"The morning hours passed slowly as she worked to fix every mechanical failure she could identify and make temporary repairs where possible. At nightfall, when it came time for a brief evening meal, Nora sat at the small table in the communal dining area and ate alone while other colonists slept. The only sound, but one of many, was rustling from a nearby group across the room.

Nora's thoughts turned toward home, and to the person who waited there for her. Her boyfriend, Willy, was waiting back on Earth for her return. He always sent her postcards when he knew she had arrived safely. His face flashed through her mind, filling her with homesickness.

""Willie,"" Nora muttered under her breath as tears burned behind her eyes. ""I miss you so much!""

The tears stung in spite of herself, though they were not unexpected and Nora would have cried regardless. After a lifetime living out of her suitcases to travel around the solar system, the security of staying somewhere and finally getting off the moving bus into some semblance of permanence, only to be forced out",55.0,8,46.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
73,0.95,"The dormitory hallways were cramped but cozy—a short distance from the showers but also closer to the mess hall for early breakfasts. She took a long, slow breath of recycled air as she walked. The halls of the colony were kept at low pressure to conserve oxygen. Her breath frosted in front of her face. She squinted as her vision misted.

She reached the dining room without freezing. Nora walked through its entrance, blinking away the fog as she entered. All around her, rows of tables filled with colonists worked their way down one wall toward the cafeteria counter. They sat along both sides, looking expectant. This was the busiest time of day for the colonists who had been up all night fixing equipment or making repairs.

Nora approached the line. Three empty seats awaited her beside a woman wearing a heavy work outfit. The two people behind her moved aside as Nora climbed the steps to join them.""Good morning, Nora,""the woman greeted her in English with a faint accent. She seemed kind, but like most other workers, Nora didn't know if she could trust this stranger's motives. She offered a smile.

The woman returned it.""I'm Giselle.""Giselle gestured to Nora's plate, which still bore half of an unfinished meal from last night. She said,""I'll have yours for you.""Nora looked down at her plate in surprise. Before she realized it, she had picked up the fork and started to fill it.""Thanks,""she muttered as she raised the utensil to her mouth.

She chewed and swallowed quickly while Giselle continued her pleasantries about the colony. There were so many layers to be peeled away between each of them. Nora wondered how anyone got along here. She felt a flash of frustration. What did they do besides work and sleep?

But that was not why she'd come out to breakfast, despite her hunger.

Nora tried to catch the server eye to ask for another slice of toast as she ate. She failed, but instead, she reached around Giselle to get closer to her fellow colonists. Her hand brushed the arm of the man on the other side of her.",78.0,6,44.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
74,0.95,"After checking the colony's power grid, Nora headed toward the cafeteria in the main hall.

""Good morning, Sully,"" she said as she entered the cavernous room.

""Mornin'."" Sully turned from a small table where he ate breakfast. He wore a stained gray uniform and had his hair buzzed close to the scalp.

""Don't you mean, 'good afternoon'?"" Nora asked with exaggerated politeness. ""The sun's already down.""

""Can't help it, sweetheart,"" the older man replied with an innocent smile and a gesture at her bed.

Nora grimaced. ""Oh, right. That's why you can't get up earlier."" She paused before adding, ""Morning for me is... early. Just give me fifteen minutes to shower off this stinking grease.""

Sully nodded in response as Nora made her way to the cafeteria line.

The food didn't make much sense—some kind of breakfast stew and a hard roll—but Nora kept shoveling it down with her hands. When she finally got to her destination, the empty seat beside Sully was taken. Nora glared at the man sitting across from him. She'd never gotten to eat before work, but even if there was room she wouldn't share Sully's spot.

Her stomach rumbled as she approached and sat down. A wave of guilt washed through Nora when she saw how quickly Sully consumed his breakfast, despite a full plate. She wanted to apologize for the mess on the floor—they'd be working together today, so cleanliness wasn't just good manners, it made a difference between getting ahead or losing someone's job.

""Good morning,"" the man said. He had dark hair and eyes, an accent unlike anything Nora had heard before, and a smile that turned up only one corner of his mouth.

""My name's Sammi. It's nice to meet you.""

Nora raised an eyebrow. ""Nice? Who are you?""

Sammy chuckled.",75.0,6,41.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
75,0.95,"She passed through a doorway that led to the colony's communal bathrooms where other colonists were already awake and working their way through a morning routine. Some had just finished their showers while others prepared for theirs. As she passed, the sounds of the communal bathroom faded behind her as it became apparent how many people worked there.

Nora entered the corridor outside the bathroom, noticing as she did so that a small cluster of people clustered around a portable screen. The group gathered around one technician seated at his station. She recognized him, but she couldn't recall his name. He wasn't new; he'd been there for years now.

He watched Nora pass by with a smile, his eyes catching hers with the barest hint of curiosity in them. That tiny glimpse told her something about him: that he was intelligent enough to know Nora would have no interest in him, nor in any man in particular. Perhaps even that she found the idea of romance laughable. She might have considered herself too young and inexperienced to consider marriage, especially considering her age, but she thought the same of most everyone else. If you took the average human being and shook up all their emotional baggage for a few months, they would be a much happier person.

But she knew it was all an act. Nora kept up the façade because it made people like Sully, her boss and friend, feel better, and it helped to keep her job.

She glanced again at the man as she passed by and he waved back.

""Morning,"" she said when she was close enough to see what he looked like in detail. His dark hair framed a sharp-chinned face with eyes of deep gray that gave his appearance a hard edge; she imagined the lines on his face were etched by experience. ""You looking forward to another day?""

He nodded. ""A little change in pace will do me some good.""

Nora nodded slowly. It was nice to know someone liked their work. She didn't make it her business to pry into other people's lives or get involved, but she could always use more friends.",78.0,7,48.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
76,0.95,"Warm sunlight filtered into a dimly lit hallway from slatted windows at regular intervals around the outer wall. The window frames were so badly rusted she could use the tips of her fingers to push them shut. She rubbed grit out from beneath each frame, trying to scrape the rust off before it ate its way through to the glass.

After several minutes of laborious work she leaned back in frustration. The frames refused to budge despite the intense heat. At last Nora heaved a sigh and slid the window open with a shuddering creak. A blast of cool morning air flooded the hallway, bringing new life to the dust and ash stinging Nora's eyes.

A quick look around confirmed her hunch about where breakfast was going to be. With more than usual caution she peered over the ledge of her dormitory window to survey the grounds below. Her breath caught for a moment in surprise.

A sleek vehicle was parked nearby, right next to the communal shower stalls. Its engine idled smoothly with nothing else moving within sight or sound. Nora blinked and squinted before taking a couple of steps forward, trying to make sure the machine really was there, because it looked so damned big. It would have been almost invisible from outside had not the dust thrown up by the recent storm clouded the air for miles around.

The heavy-duty power loader sat quietly with its tailgate fully down. Thick wheels rested on blackened tires that held them securely to the ground, like they belonged here. The vehicle resembled a huge mechanical beetle squatting silently atop the hardpan in front of her window.

Nora let out another soft gasp, but no one seemed to notice, although she knew their keen eyes were watching her from the other side of the campus. She took another step toward the vehicle and it creaked ominously under her weight.",64.0,8,43.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
77,0.95,"Most colonists lived in dormitories filled with rows of simple single rooms along hallways lined with closed doors. In the halls, laundry lines strung from ceiling to floor. Many of these lines sported clothing dangling like vines from them and wisps of smoke wafting up from their open ends, where clothes were being ironed. Others hung askew, limp and dusty. At the end of each hallway were communal showers, but no access to private bathrooms. Toiletries needed to be shared by everyone, so most colonists left themselves filthy while they were busy working.

In the mornings, the halls bustled with activity; people went about their jobs, dressed in old work wear and stained overalls. The colony's technicians were just one such group, although unlike most of the others here, Nora wasn't a technician. Her job title was Senior Engineer.

As an engineer in charge of testing the machinery throughout Presley's Promise, Nora often spent long hours fixing broken equipment and cleaning dust out of pipes. Most of her time was taken by paperwork, and she occasionally had to give verbal updates to company representatives in New York or wherever else the Company kept its colonies. But every once in a while, Nora got to test new things. And when something broke—especially something like the power plant that supplied everything she saw and used everyday—she could take it apart and fix it herself, rather than waiting for help from some other person. It made for a more interesting day, since she liked to tinker with the machines. She especially enjoyed when the parts broke down in interesting ways.

With all this downtime, Nora never seemed tired despite her grueling schedule. When not working on repairs, she played video games, read books, and practiced dance moves in her room after work at night. These weren't really hobbies per se, but simply Nora's favorite activities to do with the downtime she inevitably gained. So far, her schedule hadn't gotten too hectic and so Nora hadn't run into any serious problems yet, and there'd been no accidents either.",73.0,9,44.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
78,0.95,"It was chilly in the morning air, but Nora barely noticed. The sun hadn't risen yet, although a thin crescent moon bathed the land in silvery light. Coldness did little to slow her walk down the dark corridor toward the cafeteria.

The sound of footsteps clanging across the hall stopped Nora in her tracks. As she turned back towards the source, the young engineer heard a woman's voice, too muffled to identify, say something short and curt, then there was silence. Nora frowned. No one spoke to her that way. She wasn't sure what bothered her more: the way someone had spoken to her like that, or her reaction to it.

In any case, Nora didn't linger on her decision; she hurried down the long metal corridor until she reached the door at the end where the female voice had come from. Inhaling deeply, Nora gripped the handle firmly as she stepped inside the darkened cafeteria.

There was no one in sight. A couple of tables sat empty and unoccupied along the wall. She paused just outside the doorway, glancing around the room as her eyes adjusted. The only person she could see besides herself was a single figure standing near an open service panel beside one of the walls.

Nora moved forward cautiously, trying not to make any sudden sounds. Even if this intruder were human, she'd been attacked before and it paid to be cautious in these situations. Her steps faltered and caught when she saw what the other figure held.

It was a pair of dark lenses mounted on brass frames. She recognized them instantly—the black glass of one eye had shattered. Nora's mouth opened wordlessly as the other half fell out. The glass eye had rolled to stop at Nora's feet, while its counterpart stared straight up into her face like a blind creature on stilts.

She screamed. Then she fumbled for the gun strapped across her torso. ""Get away!"" she cried hoarsely, pressing both hands against the butt of her weapon.

The woman didn't move. ""I think we're in trouble,"" she said flatly. She lifted the black glass off the ground, pointing it towards Nora. ""Take that.""",78.0,6,44.0,0.9025,0.8573749999999999
79,0.95,"There were few people in the common room just after sunrise; colonists generally found their rest when it suited them, but most made the effort to be up early to grab their breakfasts. Nora passed by several occupied seats, taking comfort in finding nobody she recognized.

Somehow, Sully managed to sleep past the alarm. He'd been roused long enough for Nora to fill him in on what had happened while he was snoozing off shift. Now that morning was over, the two of them walked together toward the mess hall. The hall itself was dim and quiet, although outside the morning chill still lingered despite the rising sun's warmth.

As they approached, Nora spotted a single figure sitting at one of the table corners, facing inward away from everyone else. She gave him a nod as he sat back in his chair, leaving enough distance between them so the low table didn't block her view.

""Hey, Sam,"" Nora said softly.

The man swiveled around in his chair to face her, glancing up briefly and then returning his attention forward again. He looked young, but the dark circles under his eyes gave him an exhausted expression.

Nora took her seat across from him. ""You look terrible.""

Sam nodded. ""Yeah, I feel it. But with this many newbies, someone has to take the lead. I'll make sure no one gets hurt.""

He'd lost weight since last night. His lean frame had become gaunt; Nora could see bones through the skin of his arms and legs. She imagined he might break if someone poked him too hard or threw a punch at him without warning.

Nora slid into her spot beside him, resting her elbows on the tabletop. ""I know you're trying your best.""

His gaze flicked toward Nora. ""We don't have enough food for everyone, so there's not much room to spare. What would we do?""

She blinked, surprised he asked such a pointed question. ""Maybe you should talk to the Company about it.""

""They won't help us out. We're just the colonists here. Their job is keeping everything running and collecting the money.""

Nora frowned. That sounded like one hell of a pay grade. ""But what about the drones?""

Sam shook his head, gesturing at her meal plate. ""You ate yours already.""

The small suite had a table built for meetings but left clear for Sully to work. He'd taken up residence years ago when he first arrived here, long enough to become a familiar presence in the colony. But he never let it interfere with his work, even while she'd tried not to intrude. He was a friend, and Nora felt she could ask him anything.

After a moment of hesitation, she opened the door and stepped through. ""Morning,"" she greeted softly.

""Nora!"" Sully cried cheerfully from his cluttered desk. A young man with red hair, pale skin, a crooked nose, and bright green eyes sat hunched over an overflowing plate of breakfast food. The lad, only sixteen according to his file, wore a tattered old suit with dirty hands and smeared mud caked on the knees of his pants.

""Is that—a kangaroo burger?"" Nora asked uncertainly as she examined the meal sitting untouched in front of the boy.

""Yep! Kangaroo Burger Number Eight. Best damn thing to eat in this colony, ever.""

Nora could see several lights flickering on as other colonists awoke, heard quiet conversation as she passed, and spotted a woman eating cereal from a bowl, her head down and back to the wall.

With a frown, Nora turned right after passing another door with no light indicating activity. After the first hall with the rows of bunk beds ran three more before ending at a common room. She paused beside one last set of lockers where she gathered up her dirty clothes and personal belongings, stuffing them inside the locker with grim determination and pulling the door shut behind her.

She had never felt claustrophobic or cramped before she'd come to this place, and yet even her tiny apartment felt like a prison cell now.

""I can't believe you get to walk around,"" Sully commented cheerfully as he approached. ""Some people have all the luck.""

A brightening horizon reflected in the waters of one small lake. Smaller lakes lay around the camp like the dark scars of claw marks on Earth. More lakes and pools gathered into larger bodies around low hills at every compass point. All these lakes glimmered faintly in the faint morning glow that seeped through the gray atmosphere.

On this particular lake, however, there was nothing to reflect except endless emptiness. No water lapped shorelines and cliffs as high as ten stories broke the surface here. Nothing lived but the humans.

85,1.0,"Nora headed along one of the colony's hallways as she walked briskly toward the mess. She'd only been there a few times, but the food was always good and plentiful, even if the portions were small and far from generous.

It was a hot morning for early spring. The sun would be high overhead when she left, but not yet peeking over the horizon. Still, it was chilly under the dark metallic domes of the buildings, especially after her shower. A layer of perspiration coated Nora.

Most people had the duty schedule posted by their doors. In the distance, Nora could just see a line of numbers painted on a sheet taped up to announce an upcoming shift change. Nora frowned and quickened her pace as she passed the last dormitory.

She was alone, which meant the colonists hadn't come down for their breakfast yet either. For the first time ever, Nora dreaded meeting her friends at this mealtime gathering. They had barely exchanged words since arriving here three weeks ago. Most of them didn't know anything about each other outside of work or their mutual interests.

Nora stepped inside the mess, where the smells of frying food tickled her nose. She inhaled deeply, smelling eggs, bacon, toast, and biscuits cooking.",73.0,7,46.0,1.0,1.0
86,1.0,"The halls were quiet, although not completely empty since colonists ate their meals in shifts around the colony's common kitchen. A few early risers wandered up and down the corridors, but most of the rooms lay empty except for a pair of researchers deep in conversation and two people having sex at one of the few rooms open to the general population. The corridor gave way to a larger room with a cafeteria that served hot and cold food from its galley, but Nora went down the stairs leading to ground level instead.

There was no point in letting a meal pass her by. After eating, she returned to her quarters to get her personal comm link, which rang as she arrived. It was the office AI.

""I've been waiting for you,"" it chirped cheerfully as Nora walked in. ""How long have I been expecting your call?""

She glanced over her shoulder at the door, half worried someone might walk in, and then nodded toward her terminal to indicate the connection would be secure. She answered cautiously, ""About thirty minutes.""

A smile played across its lips. ""Don't take so long with the link. We're here to give you a surprise."" It chuckled, and when she shot Nora a look, it laughed louder.

Her fingers fidgeted around the strap of her terminal, wondering what else had changed since last night besides the weather.",90.0,7,43.0,1.0,1.0
87,1.0,"The corridor stretched far in both directions around the dormitory wing; beyond it were other residential wings and the colonists'living spaces. Beyond that, the colony's central square ringed by small industrial units clustered around two immense power plants.

Nora followed a hall lined with utilitarian furniture to the cafeteria. The facility was quiet, so she found the tables unoccupied save for one person. A lanky man in coveralls sat alone at the corner table staring into space. He looked tired. And cold.

When Nora approached the serving counter, the worker glanced up. ""Good morning,"" he said flatly.

She nodded back at him. ""Hi."" Nora felt a pang of unease when she saw his blank expression, but then it softened as recognition flooded in—he'd been working through the night.

""Where have you been?"" the man asked. His face bore faint dark circles under bloodshot eyes.

Nora frowned slightly, confused. ""At home. Why? Did something break?""

He shook his head wordlessly. She stared at him for a moment, not quite sure what to do with this stranger in her dormitory who had obviously suffered a harrowing nightmare.

""Do you want some food or coffee first?"" Nora inquired warily. The workers ate and worked at staggered intervals, and she had no idea how long he'd been on duty.

""No,"" he mumbled, shaking his head again.",64.0,6,45.0,1.0,1.0
88,1.0,"As she passed other beds, yawning colonists got up, gathered their belongings, and headed for the common showers at the end of each hall. Nora avoided the shared spaces, choosing to take one of several back corridors as far from others as possible in hopes the colony's layout was random enough that nobody knew exactly where she slept.

She didn't get very far. Before she made it to the main hallway she met a few people coming back, faces scrunched with sleepiness and bleary eyes. But they were polite enough not to remark about Nora sleeping until last.

When Nora reached the end of one corridor, she opened a large metal panel set flush into the wall next to her room. She stepped through it and found herself outside again on a small terrace surrounded by dense greenery, dotted with clumps of grasses that rippled in the wind. The space was filled with various machines and devices set out under sheets for repair or assembly, giving the impression of an outdoor workshop. In the distance a narrow road wound between low hills and scattered copses toward a large structure on another rise, presumably some form of power plant. Beyond that, nothing could be seen but distant gray sky.

Nora let herself relax for a moment as she took in the view and indulged her exhaustion. Though the sky here was perpetually dark and overcast, there might be a day when this place wasn't utterly blasted by sandstorms and dust storms, when there was actually light enough to see. Nora had yet to meet anyone who thought the colonists shouldn't have brought lights down from orbit during those rare periods of clear weather and put them up here instead. Of course, most of them seemed to come along with the idea that the Company would help pay for the construction of the colony and keep it running indefinitely in exchange for a long-term contract with their",81.0,11,49.0,1.0,1.0
89,1.0,"Nora opened the door marked 'Administer' and stepped through into a wide hall of utilitarian design. The lights came on as she walked, their soft glow casting an unwholesome pall over the barren spaces.

It seemed everyone else had the same idea. A dozen people filed along, each one heading for the common dining room. Nora kept to herself, following the path and taking comfort in the familiar clang of tool belts from boots thumping the floor. In this way she made her way through the cavernous halls without passing anyone who might ask about why she looked so odd, dressed in faded green trousers with high sides and worn boots, rather than the more professional and stylish uniforms supplied by the Company.

That thought struck a chord. For years Nora had avoided thinking too much about the people working alongside her—the colonists, mechanics, and engineers who kept everything running. She was paid and respected for her work but that respect never extended beyond her title as a technician. To most she simply worked, just another cog in the machine.

But now she realized how wrong she'd been. Even when everyone on the planet was working, there were always those who weren't.",80.0,9,48.0,1.0,1.0
