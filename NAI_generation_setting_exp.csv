0,0.6,1.0,0.9,74.0,5,44.0,"The colony's central courtyard was a vast expanse filled with rows of identical low-slung buildings, each housing its own residents. The colonists' communal kitchens were open to everyone, so Nora picked up a tray and joined the line at one of the food stations. She took her place in the long queue behind two other people, both dressed in the same utilitarian uniform as herself.

The line moved slowly, but Nora didn't mind; she was used to being hungry. As the morning progressed, the cafeteria filled with more people, some of whom were already eating. A few glanced over at Nora as they passed her, but no one said anything. She felt their eyes on her, though, like invisible fingers trailing across her skin.

Nora finished her meal and returned to the dormitory, where she washed dishes and stacked them in the recycler for later use. She then grabbed a fresh set of clothes and headed back out into the courtyard.

A soft chime announced her arrival, and the door slid aside with a hiss. Nora walked through the threshold and stopped dead, mouth agape. The entire room was packed with people, most of whom were wearing the same bright orange jumpsuits as Nora. In the middle of the group stood a man in a dark blue suit. He had short, blond hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to bore holes through Nora's brain.

""Good morning, Miss Decker,"" he greeted her cheerfully. ""Please come in.""

Nora stared at him blankly. She couldn't have heard correctly. What was this?

The man smiled broadly. ""I'm your new supervisor, Dr. O'Donnell. I'd like to welcome you to the colony.""

Nora blinked. Her head was spinning with confusion. ""My... my what?""

""Your supervisor, Miss Decker,"" the man repeated patiently. ""You're joining our team. Your duties will be to maintain the colony's machinery, make repairs, and oversee its growth. I've been assigned to help train you in these tasks.""

He gestured toward a stack of papers on one of the tables. On top of the pile was Nora's contract. She stared at it dumbfounded. How could they possibly expect her to sign something like this? She didn't know anything about the Company or the colonists!",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

The colony's automated systems kept everyone fed and comfortable, but the colonists still had to do their own work. Most of the colonists were up early anyway, so Nora found herself alone in the corridors.

She walked briskly toward the mess hall. Her boots clanged on the metal floor as she passed the dormitories. At the end of the corridor, the communal showers waited. She slowed to a stop, looking over her shoulder at the closed door.

She heard the sound of the water first, then the faintest hint of voices. She recognized Nora's voice.

The sounds grew louder.

Nora stepped into the shower area, then turned back to the door. She reached out and knocked lightly. ""Eve?""

""Yes, Nora,"" Eve responded in a low, calm tone.

""I'm ready.""

""Come in, Nora.""

Nora opened the door and stepped inside. The shower room was large enough to accommodate several people at once. Three other women were already there, dressed in similar clothes. All three looked up from their conversation and greeted her with friendly smiles.

""Morning, Nora!"" one of them called.

The others chorused, ""Good morning, Nora!""

They seemed happy to see her.

""You're early this morning,"" another woman said. She smiled warmly as she spoke.

Nora didn't respond immediately, instead taking in the rest of the room. A row of cubicles lined the walls. Each contained a bed and small desk. The cubicles were separated by doors, which opened out onto shared areas.

The shower area at the far end of the room had been converted into a communal bathroom. It held two showers, one for each gender, plus a toilet and sink.

""I just got up,"" Nora explained. ""I couldn't sleep.""

""Oh."" The other woman's smile faded. She looked at the others in the room, then back to Nora. ""We should be getting ready soon. We have to finish our shifts today so we can leave on schedule.""

""Okay,"" Nora replied, though she wasn't sure what they meant. ""Where do I go?""",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
2,0.6,1.0,0.9,65.0,6,46.0,"The corridor outside the dormitory was narrow, its walls made of smooth, reflective metal plates. The ceiling was low and flat, the floors sloped slightly downward toward the center. Nora walked quickly to avoid falling on her face. She passed other colonists heading in opposite directions, each wearing their own version of a uniform and carrying their own personal loaders and tools.

Nora reached the mess hall at the far end of the hallway and turned left to walk through the double doors.

A wave of heat washed over Nora as she entered the large room, and she paused to let it wash over her. A long counter ran along one side of the room. In front of it were several rows of high stools that faced a row of small tables. On the wall above the counter, a clock showed the time.

The colony was located in a remote region where the sun never rose. This room was the only place Nora could get fresh air and sunlight. She took a seat at the nearest table, which was already crowded with two other colonists who had come to eat before starting work.

Nora fidgeted uncomfortably as she waited for her food. She knew from experience how much trouble the Colony Manager made when colonists skipped meals. Nora hadn't missed a meal in days, but that wasn't going to last forever.

She pulled out her tray and placed it on the tabletop. As she did so, the door behind her opened.

The man who walked in was tall, lean, and dark haired. He wore an olive drab uniform and carried himself with confidence. Nora didn't know him, but she recognized his bearing. The Colony Manager.

""Nora Decker?"" he asked. His tone was polite but cold. ""I'm Captain Michael Breen.""

""Yes, sir,"" Nora replied. She stood up to shake hands.

Captain Breen was a good ten centimeters taller than Nora. She had to look up into his eyes. It was unnerving, like looking at a stranger.",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
3,0.6,1.0,0.9,83.0,4,41.0,"The dormitory halls were quiet, the colonists asleep in their beds. Nora stopped at a small kitchen to grab a bowl and spoon. She found a few stale pastries left over from yesterday's meal. The colony had rationed food supplies as much as possible. There was little waste, but the colonists didn't have much to spare.

The dining hall was empty save for the two women eating alone at one of the long tables. Nora slid into the seat next to them, digging into her bowl. She chewed slowly while she watched the other woman eat.

""Morning,"" said the woman. Her name was Evelyn. She wore her brown hair cut short and neat. A pale scar ran across her cheekbone.

Nora nodded, swallowing her mouthful of mushy cereal. ""Hi.""

Evelyn finished chewing before speaking again. ""I don't know how you do it, Nora. I've been up since four, and my eyes are killing me.""

""It's not so bad,"" Nora replied. She kept her tone even. It was rare for anyone to complain about being awake this early. ""You get used to it after a while. And we're supposed to be working today, remember?""

Evelyn shrugged. ""Yeah. I'm going down to the power plant. I'll see if there's anything broken. You go on ahead and eat breakfast.""

Nora ate her last bite, set her bowl aside, and stood. ""Thanks. See ya later.""

She walked through the main hall into the corridor. The door to the dining hall opened behind her, and Evelyn stepped out. Nora turned back toward the kitchen and caught a glimpse of Evelyn's face.

A strange expression crossed Evelyn's features for an instant, then she smiled. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora paused. Something wasn't right. She glanced at Evelyn's eyes, which were blue and normal. Then Nora realized what was wrong with her vision.

Her eyes were red and glowing like those of a vampire.

Nora stared at Evelyn in shock, unable to believe what she saw. Her skin felt cold despite the heat of her body. A chill crept up Nora's spine, making her tremble.

""Nora? Are you okay?""

The woman who called herself Evelyn held out her hands. They weren't red and glowing like Nora's. They were pale and unmarked.",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
4,0.6,1.0,0.9,91.0,8,43.0,"The corridor outside her room was empty except for the automated doors at the end of each hall. The automated door guards were programmed to let anyone pass, but they also served as sentry points. They monitored the halls for intruders and opened the outer gates for colonists leaving the dormitories.

The hallway outside Nora's room was lined with identical rooms, their open doors revealing the small, utilitarian furnishings inside. She passed several other rooms where colonists slept in silence, their breathing a rhythmic sound like waves on distant shores.

Nora walked past the last door to the end of the hall, where she turned right and headed for the communal showers. The cold water would help wash away the lingering cobwebs from sleep.

She pushed through the swinging door and stopped short, surprised by what lay beyond it.

A large rectangular pool occupied the middle of the floor. A series of steps led down to a wide ledge around the edge of the pool, and along its side ran a long, thin bench with a row of lockers underneath.

Atop the opposite wall stood an automated showerhead, spraying water into the air in a gentle stream. A line of soap dispensers sat beside the locker area. Several more benches lined the walls on either side of the pool, and the far end was filled with a bank of toilet stalls.

The scene looked inviting, but Nora hesitated to enter the pool. It might be contaminated with the hive's filth.

In her mind, she envisioned a swarm of drones waiting for her in the deep waters.

With a sigh, Nora stepped over the threshold and lowered herself onto the bench closest to the showers.",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
5,0.6,1.0,0.9,85.0,5,49.0,"The halls were dimly lit by dim blue lights at intervals. Nora navigated along them, listening for the sound of voices. She passed a few colonists moving about their duties in the early morning hours, but none were awake yet. The only sounds she heard came from the corridor walls.

The hallways were lined with doors leading to different rooms. She stopped at one of the doors and pressed her ear against it, hearing nothing. With a sigh, Nora knocked on the door twice, waited for someone to answer, then opened the door to enter.

Inside was a small room with three beds and a communal bathroom. Nora turned around, surprised that no one had come to see who had entered the room. She walked back out of the dormitory and closed the door behind her.

She paused outside the entrance to listen again, this time straining to hear any noise coming from inside. A faint clatter sounded through the wall, followed by a muffled curse.

Nora crept into the room and peeked through the window beside the door. She saw an empty bed and a pile of clothing on the floor. But the clattering sound continued. Nora peered around the corner, but couldn't tell what was making it.

""Hey, you,"" Nora called out. ""I'm talking to you.""

The clattering ceased. There was a long pause, then a thump from the other side of the room. Nora winced at the sound of something heavy falling over.

A moment later, a pale, gaunt figure emerged from the shadows. It was thin, wearing tattered clothes and a stained apron. Its face was covered in dark stubble and its eyes were sunken and bloodshot.

Nora stared at the person for several seconds before she realized it wasn't a person.",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
6,0.6,1.0,0.9,72.0,4,40.0,"The corridors were empty, quiet save for the soft creak of Nora's boots. The corridor walls were a dull gray color with dark metallic veins. She felt her way along the wall, counting the doors as she passed them. She reached the end of the hall without incident.

Nora entered the main dining room to find it empty except for a lone figure at one of the tables. Sully sat alone, wearing a thick coat and hat over his hairless head. His long fingers gripped the table edge as he stared into space.

He looked up when Nora approached. ""Good morning,"" he said softly, then stood.

""Morning,"" Nora replied. She took a seat opposite him.

Sully nodded to her with a faint smile. He wore a pale blue shirt under his coat, the collar turned up around his ears. Nora noticed that his eyes were red rimmed.

Nora glanced away from him, looking toward the front door as if she could see through it and into the stormy weather beyond. She shivered.

""I'm going out."" Nora paused, uncertain how to continue. ""To check on something. I'll be back soon. We can eat together.""

She pushed her chair back from the table. Sully's lips twitched.

Nora gathered her jacket and left the room. She didn't look back.

Outside, she found an empty hallway and followed it to the exit. The wind blew hard, forcing her to take deep breaths before she stepped outside. Nora pulled her hood up over her head, then checked her wristwatch as she walked briskly down the path. It was 8: 30 AM.

The sun had risen only a few minutes ago. Nora squinted at the bright light and turned her face away, shielding her eyes with one hand. She felt exposed without sunglasses or goggles. But she knew they wouldn't work in this environment.

Nora followed the winding path out of the settlement, passing several more buildings until she reached the edge of the colony.",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
7,0.6,1.0,0.9,77.0,5,53.0,"The corridors were empty at this early hour. The lights blinked dimly, making the long hallways seem even darker than they really were. Even the ceiling panels overhead seemed to glow faintly.

Nora found herself in a large dining area where rows of tables were lined up in neat, orderly fashion. She took her place among the other colonists at a table near the front of the room. They sat silently as she scanned their faces for familiar ones.

Most of the colonists looked like her, but there were a few others. Some were older, some younger. Nora spotted several women and two men who didn't look like her at all. Most of them wore dark clothing, while a few had on brightly colored tunics. A handful of people had on the same kind of clothes that Nora did, but most of them were dressed differently.

Nora tried to count heads. There should have been thirty or so of them. But when she glanced around the room, she noticed that a couple of people weren't sitting with the rest. One man stood off in the corner by himself and another woman was missing.

She frowned as she tried to figure out what could be wrong. Something about the situation felt... off. She'd seen enough movies and holos to know how important it was for a group of strangers to stick together in a crisis.

But this wasn't a movie. This was reality. And the colony was on its own. The Company wouldn't come back for weeks.

Nora's heart beat faster as she remembered the last time she'd been alone in a hostile environment. It hadn't ended well.

""You're late,"" said a voice from behind her.

Startled, Nora turned and saw that the man who had spoken was standing next to the table. He looked like he belonged here. Tall and muscular, with short, dark hair, his skin was tanned and weathered. His eyes were a striking shade of green, and they seemed to look right through her.

He wore a loose shirt that hung open over a pair of tight pants.",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
9,0.6,1.0,0.9,74.0,6,44.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by yellow lights that flickered overhead. The walls, floors, ceilings, and even the doorframes were made of metal plates welded together. A few small plants grew in pots at intervals along the halls to keep them from feeling too empty.

As she walked, Nora heard the distant sound of machinery and the hum of power tools. She stopped to peer down a side hallway where several workers were busily welding something onto the wall. In front of each worker was a large rectangular box that looked like a tool rack. One of the workers glanced up at her. He smiled as he saw Nora's confused expression, then continued his work.

She turned away, shaking her head in confusion. She'd seen this sort of thing before. Why didn't I know about these?

Nora shook her head again. Maybe there wasn't time to learn everything. She had no idea how many other things she would have missed.

But what if we're not prepared for anything else? What if some other problem comes up that we can't handle?

Her stomach rumbled. Nora started down the corridor toward the mess hall. She passed a door marked ""Maintenance."" It was closed and dark, but the faint smell of oil lingered. Nora tried to imagine what went on inside, but couldn't picture it clearly enough to make sense of the noises she heard.

The mess hall was open and bright with morning sunlight. Several workers sat at long tables, eating breakfast or talking quietly over their meal. Nora spotted the cook and a couple of helpers nearby. They were busy at the stove, stirring and flipping food as they cooked it.

Nora paused outside the doorway to get her bearings. The mess hall was located in one corner of the colony, near the hydroponics greenhouse. Past the mess hall, Nora could see rows of greenhouses that stretched out into the distance. A few workers milled around the greenhouse walls, tending to crops and watering plants.

The mess hall itself was long and narrow, lined with large metal plates that looked like cafeteria trays. Most of the tables were empty except for a handful of workers who ate alone, hunched over their meals and staring down at the table in front of them. Nora recognized several from her engineering class.

She stepped through the door and headed for an empty table. She picked up a tray and filled it with eggs, toast, bacon, and fresh fruit. As she sat down, Nora noticed the man sitting across from her. He was tall and thin, wearing a black uniform that fit him snugly.",0.12806122448979618,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
10,0.65,1.0,0.9,72.0,6,43.0,"Nora paused outside the door to her dormitory and listened for movement inside. A few colonists stirred, groaned in their beds, or muttered indistinctly as they worked through another nightmare. The sound of the alarm was still ringing faintly from her room, but it faded quickly as she left the building.

The air in the hall was chill and dry, carrying traces of dust and vapor. Nora took a deep breath to clear her lungs, then turned toward the dining area.

Nora entered the large communal space. In the dim glow of emergency lighting, the tables were empty except for a single person sitting at one end.

Valentina Kern. Commander Kern sat alone, staring at her hands folded in her lap. Her eyes were shadowed in dark hollows, and her lips were pressed together tightly. She wore a long coat with a hood over her shoulders, despite the warmth of the day.

Nora hesitated. Valentina looked like a lost child waiting for a parent to notice her presence. But if Valentina wanted company, she would ask. Nora had been too preoccupied with work to talk to anyone else since arriving.

Nora stepped forward and cleared her throat. Valentina's head snapped up, and her expression hardened. She stood up abruptly and walked away without saying a word.

Nora watched the commander go, and then returned to her own quarters. The alarm was still going off in her room, but she ignored it. She'd get a new one soon enough.

Nora pulled on her boots and jacket, then left the dormitory and headed to the mess hall. Breakfast was always the same thing here. Bacon, eggs, toast, and coffee. It tasted like ashes in her mouth, and she didn't know why. She couldn't remember eating anything today.

As Nora approached the dining area, a thin woman with stringy black hair hurried out of an adjacent door. She wore a heavy coat over faded blue jeans, and carried a clipboard tucked under one arm.

""You're late,"" the woman scolded. ""Breakfast starts in twenty minutes.""

Nora frowned at the stranger. She had a tired look about her, like she hadn't slept well last night. Her eyes were red and swollen from crying, and her cheeks were gaunt.

Nora stepped aside to let the other woman pass, and then followed behind.",0.17806122448979622,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

The halls were dim, but she could still make out the shapes of the other colonists. They slept in small groups in their rooms, a few of them sitting up to watch her pass.

She walked briskly along the hall, nodding at those who acknowledged her presence. A few of the women gave her curious looks as they noticed her boots, but most kept their eyes focused on the floor. She was used to it.

The smell of fresh coffee tickled her nose as she reached the end of the hallway. Nora peered into the cafeteria. Several tables were filled with people eating breakfast, but no one seemed to notice her. She turned back around the corner and continued down the long passage.

Nora's destination was the mess hall. It was located at the far end of the colony and separated from the rest of the complex by a wide walkway. She made her way through the corridors and stopped in front of the entrance, which was marked with a large blue door. The door had an electronic lock that required a code to open.

She looked up at the door. There wasn't much time before she had to leave for work, so she punched in her four-digit code. As soon as the door slid open, Nora stepped inside and locked it behind her.

The interior of the mess hall was bright and airy. The walls were lined with a variety of potted plants and hanging baskets. A wide table dominated the center of the room, and several chairs and stools surrounded it. The floor was tiled in dark gray ceramic, with a scattering of colorful rugs over the surface. At the back of the room, a counter provided seating and food service.

A few colonists sat at the table, eating breakfast and talking quietly. Nora walked up to the counter and placed her order. While she waited, she watched the other patrons. Most of them kept their eyes on the food in front of them, but a couple of people glanced at her as they passed.

Her meal arrived just as she finished paying. She picked up a plate and loaded it with eggs, bacon, and toast. Her hunger didn't diminish after the first bite.",0.17806122448979622,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

A few colonists were already seated at long tables, eating their breakfasts. Nora headed straight for a table near the back of the room where she could see the kitchen.

She took a seat next to a young man who looked like he had just woken up. He was tall, dark haired, and handsome with strong features. Nora liked him immediately but didn't know his name.

""Morning,"" she greeted him.

He blinked bleary eyes in response. ""Uh... morning.""

""I'm Nora,"" she said.

His brow furrowed as he tried to place her face. ""Oh, right, I remember now. You're the engineer who fixed the communications system last night. Nice work, Nora. That was pretty tricky.""

Nora's mouth quirked upward in a half smile. ""Thanks. It wasn't too bad.""

""Yeah? I mean, it was good work.""

Nora nodded and sipped her coffee. The hot drink warmed her throat on its way down. She looked around the room. Most colonists were still asleep or eating breakfast.

""What do you think of this place?"" she asked.

The man shrugged. ""It's okay. Not my thing. Don't really see the appeal myself. But if you're going to live out here, then you'll have to put up with a lot of things.""

""That's why they pay us,"" Nora said. ""We get paid for putting up with stuff.""

He chuckled. ""Good point. I've been meaning to ask you something. How come you're the only engineer on duty? Shouldn't there be two?""

Nora glanced at him in surprise, but he was already digging into his scrambled eggs.

""There were a couple of other engineers working last night,"" Nora said slowly. ""But they both called in sick today.""

He gave her an amused look. ""Sick? Seriously?""

She nodded. ""They're probably just getting their sleep in. They'll be fine.""

""Oh, I don't know. I can see them falling asleep right now and never waking up again.""

""It'll be okay,"" she repeated, more forcefully this time. ""I'm sure they're not contagious.""",0.17806122448979622,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

She couldn't see much in the way of furniture, but the walls were lined with shelves of canned goods, dried fruits, and other staples. The hallways were utilitarian, though. A few doors on either side led to the communal bathrooms, and at the end of each hallway was a large mirror, where Nora could check her appearance for the day.

A faint sound echoed through the halls as she walked toward the cafeteria. Footsteps? Was someone coming? Nora paused, listening intently. No. Just the wind. It whistled around the corners of the corridors.

Nora turned down another corridor that led to the mess hall. It wasn't yet open, so the only illumination came from a few emergency lights. She made her way slowly along the narrow passage, holding onto the wall and peering into the gloom ahead of her with both hands outstretched like a blind person.

The sounds grew louder. Nora stopped, wondering what they could be. She listened again, but heard nothing more. Whatever it was, it sounded as if it was moving away. As if it was going to stop.

Nora continued forward, the tension in her stomach building. She couldn't see anything now, but the noises were getting closer. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled.

She reached the end of the corridor and peeked out into the bright, expansive cafeteria. Empty. But the noise had been close. Very close. Nora glanced down at her feet, where she saw a small scrap of material caught between two toes. She bent down to pick up the scrap of cloth.

It was a piece of fabric. A shirt sleeve. Torn and stained with dirt. Her gaze followed the length of the arm down until she realized that the arm wasn't attached to the body. It lay in the middle of the floor.

Nora wandered toward the far wall, trying to decide if she wanted cereal or eggs. When she got closer, she saw that there were no tables. Instead, the room was filled with small round plastic plates with blue and white patterns. The patterned plates looked like they'd been manufactured from sheets of thin, flat glass, but Nora knew better.

The plates were made of synthetic materials. They were sturdy, durable, and lightweight, but they couldn't hold food. And yet the colonists ate off them every day.

Nora stared down at the plates in confusion for a moment, then turned and left the cafeteria. She needed to find someone who could explain what was going on.

As Nora walked along a hallway, she noticed that the walls were lined with windows. The view out of each window was obscured by the metal frames, but she could see enough to tell she wasn't in a city or town.",0.17806122448979622,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

Nora walked over to the table, grabbed a tray, and took a seat at the end nearest the door. She'd never been in this part of the building before. It was different from the residential wing. More utilitarian, less colorful. Nora didn't know why. She just knew she liked it better here.

She poured herself a cup of coffee, then sat back to wait. Her stomach growled in anticipation as she surveyed the mess on her plate. Breakfast had already arrived. She picked up a fork and began eating.

""Oh, hello there.""

Nora jumped out of her skin. She looked down to see a young man standing behind her, smiling. He wore a plain blue shirt and tan pants with a belt. His hair was dark brown and his eyes were bright. Nora couldn't help but notice he had a nice smile. It made her feel safe.

""Um, hi,"" she said awkwardly. ""You startled me.""

He chuckled. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.""

""That's okay. You weren't too loud, anyway."" She glanced around. ""Where are your quarters?""

No answer.

What if I'm not alone? What if it's just an intruder who got into my quarters while I slept? But what would they want with me?

With a quick glance over her shoulder, Nora ran to the next room on the left. Her heart beat faster in her chest as she knocked and called for someone inside.

Nothing happened.

Nora swallowed hard and pushed open the door. A large, dark-haired man stood behind a desk, leaning against it with arms folded across his broad chest. He wore a simple white shirt, a pair of black slacks, and a tie. His hair was cropped short and he had prominent cheekbones and a long nose.

""Nora,"" he said in greeting. ""You're late.""

Nora blinked, surprised by the calm tone in his voice.",0.17806122448979622,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

Nora paused in front of him. ""Sully?""

""Morning, Nora."" He nodded to her and continued the conversation. She watched him for a moment, then walked past, nodding politely.

She stopped again at the top of the stairs leading up to the engineering bays. The door was closed, but she heard voices coming from inside. She knocked lightly on the heavy metal panel.

A deep voice answered, sounding tired. ""Yeah? What is it?""

""Hey, Sully. I'm going down to breakfast. You want anything?""

""No thanks.""

Nora paused in the hallway for a moment, watching him. His face was drawn and pale with fatigue. ""You look like you haven't slept well. Are you okay?""

He shrugged. ""I'll be fine."" He glanced at her, then quickly looked away. ""Thanks for asking, though.""

The rest of Nora's shift passed uneventfully. Her duties were routine, mostly maintenance and repair work. When she was finished, Nora went down to the cafeteria.

Nora sat alone in a corner table near the kitchen. She'd been here long enough that most of the other workers knew her by name, but she still felt an odd sense of anonymity. The colony was a small place, and she was one of only three women working there.

She picked at her food listlessly. She didn't feel hungry, even though it had been hours since the last meal.

A sudden hush fell over the dining hall. Everyone turned to look in the direction of the main concourse, where the sound came from.

Nora stood up and followed the rest of the people toward the center of the room. A tall man wearing a black jumpsuit strode down the middle aisle, his hands clasped behind him. He wore no helmet, and his dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail.

He stopped in front of the cafeteria door and waited for everyone to gather around him. ""All right, listen up,"" he said. ""I'm Captain Jacobo.""",0.17806122448979622,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
20,0.7,1.0,0.9,79.0,4,46.0,"The hallway to the dormitories was dimly lit and cold as she walked toward the front doors at the end of the hall. At the door, Nora paused, taking a deep breath and trying to calm herself. She could hear voices from the other side of the door.

""You're sure about this?"" Sully asked in a low voice.

Nora knew that voice. It belonged to a tall man named Jack. He was one of the colony's best engineers. The two had worked together many times on jobs, but Nora hadn't spoken to him since he'd become the colony's second engineer.

""Yes,"" Jack replied. ""I'm sure. I've been thinking about it for months.""

Sully sighed. ""Well, if you say so. But be careful.""

The door swung open with a bang as Nora pushed through. A blast of frigid air slapped her in the face. She shivered in shock, trying to catch her balance and steady her breathing as she took in the scene before her.

Nora's eyes widened at the sight of the room full of people. In the middle of the group, a small figure with short dark hair stood awkwardly, leaning against the wall. Her heart skipped a beat as she saw the young woman's face. It was Amy, an old friend who lived in one of the dormitories.

Amy glanced up at Nora and mouthed the words, ""Help me"" .

Nora nodded and stepped forward, trying to move slowly and quietly. When she reached the center of the group, Nora tried to speak.

""What is this?""

She was answered only by a chorus of gasps from those around her. Jack stared at Nora, his mouth hanging open in shock.

""That's Amy,"" he said finally. ""She doesn't understand what's happening.""

Nora felt a chill ripple through her body. She looked back at the girl. Her eyes were wide and glassy, but she made no sound. She wore clothes just like Nora did.",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
21,0.7,1.0,0.9,82.0,4,48.0,"A narrow hallway led directly to the cafeteria. The passage was dimly lit by recessed lights. A few colonists walked past her on their way to breakfast, but she ignored them and kept moving. She made it halfway to the dining hall when the door slid open and a man entered. He wore heavy black leather gloves, thick boots, and what looked like body armor over his clothes.

Nora hesitated. This was the first time someone had ever worn that much protective gear in the colony. She knew it wasn't necessary. But even if he hadn't been armed, there were other reasons why this guy might not be welcome.

He stopped at the end of the corridor to look around. His eyes darted left, right, up, down, and back again. Then he turned and went through the doorway.

Nora waited a moment longer for him to leave before following. She caught a glimpse of his face in the cafeteria's mirror as he passed behind her. It was dark, but she thought the stranger looked familiar.

She found her usual seat and sat down, waiting for breakfast to arrive. There was something about him. She could feel it. Something wasn't quite right.

The food arrived, and Nora ate mechanically, staring off into space. After a few bites, her thoughts drifted to the strange man who had come in. She remembered his eyes. They'd seemed so bright, yet cold and emotionless. That wasn't like anyone she knew. And that was only one of many things wrong with him.

Nora finished eating, shoved the tray away, and stood up from the table. She stretched before heading toward the restroom. On her way, she passed the corridor leading to the weapons shop. The door slid open, and a second man entered wearing heavy boots and body armor. He looked over at Nora as she passed. His eyes were a startling gray color, almost silver in the dim light.

He didn't say anything. Didn't acknowledge her presence. He just kept walking.

Nora paused outside the bathroom. She felt a chill run through her blood.

The hairs on the back of her neck prickled.

She turned and ran.",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
22,0.7,1.0,0.9,88.0,5,43.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists already up and about. Nora walked to the common area where she found a handful of people eating cereal and drinking coffee. She joined them at their table, accepting a mug from the server.

""Good morning,"" said the server. ""I'm Lianna.""

""Hi, Lianna. I'm Nora.""

Lianna smiled warmly. ""It's nice to meet you, Nora. Would you like anything else?""

""No thanks. That'll do fine.""

She took a sip of her coffee while Nora waited for the server to leave. After watching Nora for a moment, Lianna spoke again.

""You're the only engineer, right?""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah. I'm the best. The Company sent me here with this colony because they want me to fix whatever's broken so we can get back home. They pay us pretty well, but it doesn't cover everything. We have a lot of expenses on our own.""

""What kind of stuff breaks down around here? And how often does it happen?""

""Most of the systems are older than my grandparents. We use a lot of old machinery and technology, which isn't exactly cutting edge anymore. Our air filters don't work very well, for example. There aren't any real maintenance crews to keep things running smoothly.""

Lianna paused in her duties, giving Nora a sympathetic look. ""I'm sorry about the filter thing. It must be hard on you guys.""

Nora shrugged with a forced smile. ""It's okay. Nobody likes an inefficient system. But I'd rather deal with the bugs than the drones. Those things come out of nowhere sometimes. They just pop up from inside walls or under floors. They grab people, drag them off into their nests and kill them.""

Lianna grimaced sympathetically. ""That sounds awful! What do they eat?""

""People mostly. Sometimes other colonists. They even eat each other sometimes, if there's not enough food for everyone.""

Nora shuddered at the thought of a hive full of writhing bodies. She took another sip of coffee and watched Lianna finish her rounds, then turn to walk away.

Nora leaned back in her chair with a sigh. ""They're creepy. But they make good fertilizer. The Company is so pleased with us for growing so much food.""",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
25,0.7,1.0,0.9,87.0,4,38.0,"She found Sully at the galley. The cafeteria was already bustling with colonists preparing their own breakfasts. Most were eating alone, but a few groups clustered around tables. One table held four young men and women, each wearing a white coat and sitting on stools in front of the long counter that served as the dining area's far wall.

Nora paused beside the entrance to the kitchen, looking for Sully. She spotted him across the room, standing behind the counter by himself. He wore a dark blue button-down shirt over a black vest with shiny buttons. His hair was slicked back into a tight, short ponytail, and he was chewing his food slowly.

Sully noticed Nora watching him, and gave her a nod. She nodded back, then made her way across the room toward him.

The cafeteria buzzed with noise. Nora passed through the crowd of colonists who stood in line waiting to be served. She scanned the menu on the chalkboard hanging above the serving counters, noting that breakfast options included bacon and eggs, pancakes, sausage patties, hash browns, fresh fruit, milk, orange juice, coffee, tea, and water.

Nora stopped in front of the counter and spoke to Sully. ""Morning, boss.""

""Good morning,"" Sully replied. He offered her a small smile, which she returned.

Nora watched him with an unreadable expression. ""I need to check out the farms today. Can you cover my shift?""

Sully hesitated. ""Sure. What do we have today?""

Nora looked at him quizzically. Sully wasn't averse to working late, but it was unusual for him to volunteer for extra shifts.

""It's just a quick look around the greenhouses. I'm sure I can find something else to do with our time.""

Sully frowned. He pursed his lips and thought about it. Then he sighed and nodded. ""All right. You're in charge. I'll leave you to it.""

He walked away, leaving Nora alone with her breakfast. She ordered a plate of bacon, eggs, and hash browns. As the food arrived, she dug into the meal.",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
26,0.7,1.0,0.9,74.0,4,43.0,"The air outside was brisk, but dry, despite its early morning chill. She turned toward the colony's central building where she knew the cafeteria was located.

As she walked along the hallway past rows of doors, a few people glanced up from their work. Some saw her and gave her friendly nods; others just looked away. The faces were worn and tired.

Nora kept her eyes forward, focusing on the path ahead of her rather than the people around her. After a while, the clack of her boots on the grating became the only sound. Nora reached the end of the corridor and began to turn right.

A sudden movement to her left caught her attention. Something black shot out of one of the side corridors, racing straight at her.

Nora's heart slammed into her chest as the thing pounced on her back, pinning her arms down. It had talons that dug deep into her shoulders and throat. Her face was buried in the creature's thick fur and she couldn't breathe.

Nora tried to scream, but the creature bit down on her neck and the pain overwhelmed her. She thrashed wildly under the weight of the beast, trying to throw it off, but it held her firmly in place with its claws.

Terrified, Nora stopped struggling. The monster's grip tightened around her throat until she felt her windpipe close. Her vision went dark.

The thing on top of her snarled. Its breath was hot and rancid, filled with the smell of stale sweat. Nora gagged. She could barely feel her hands.

Her mind flashed to the last time she'd been pinned like this. It was a nightmare from her childhood. The beast would kill her if she didn't do something fast.

She started to panic, and then she saw the knife on her belt. A surge of adrenaline kicked in, giving her strength. As the thing's jaws clamped down, Nora twisted the blade out of its scabbard.

She slammed the hilt into the creature's face as hard as she could. The impact knocked it back several feet. Nora scrambled free and ran for the end of the hallway where the cafeteria was located.",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
27,0.7,1.0,0.9,73.0,5,46.0,"Nora followed the corridor to the common area where the colony's mess hall was located. The place was dark except for a few lights dimly glowing through windows set high in the walls. This section of the colony was designed with a central concourse that connected each wing.

At one end of the concourse, a wide stairway spiraled up to the command center. At the other, a long table was arranged along both sides of the passage for dining purposes.

Nora found a seat at the table near the door. She sat on a stool while she waited for the meal to be prepared. A few colonists passed her on their way out of the mess hall, but no one said anything as they went about their day.

After Nora had finished her meal and cleaned up, she walked down the short hallway that led back to her quarters. Her boots clicked loudly on the metal decking as she hurried toward the stairs.

In her haste, she failed to notice a drone standing in the shadows of the corridor. It was tall and narrow with shiny black skin. The insectoid creature stood motionless like a statue until Nora rounded the corner and was out of sight. Then it began to follow her.

The drone crept after Nora silently, its head swiveling around to keep track of the human. It didn't want to risk being seen or heard. So it stayed close enough that if Nora turned, she would see it right away.

Nora paused when she reached the bottom of the staircase leading up to the command center. She looked over her shoulder at the hovering, silent drone. A chill rippled through her body, followed by a wave of nausea. She felt sick.

Nora swallowed hard and took the steps two at a time, hurrying up the long stairway. The drone followed. Nora's heart pounded in her chest. Her palms were sweating. Her mouth was dry. Her stomach churned.

She climbed the stairs with every step feeling like she was going to throw up.",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
28,0.7,1.0,0.9,88.0,6,53.0,"She made her way past the dormitories to the communal kitchen. Her boots clacked along the tiled floors as she walked, leaving behind damp footprints that quickly dried in the morning chill. The air was sharp and crisp and the sun's rays were still pale.

The kitchen was a long, narrow room with large, glassless windows at either end. One window looked out onto the desert, and the other opened up to the hills beyond the walls of the colony. Sunlight reflected off the windowpanes, making the interior appear brighter than it actually was.

There was no one else around, but Nora knew that wouldn't last for long. The colonists woke early to begin their day. They'd be filtering in from the dormitories soon enough.

Nora paused, looking out the window toward the desert. She could see a few people walking in the distance, but the view was obscured by the rolling fog. A drone circled overhead, and Nora shivered. She hated drones.

She went back to the kitchen and filled a mug with water, then poured herself a tall cup of coffee. After several minutes of brewing, she carried her drink out into the common area. The room was so cold that condensation formed on the inside of the mug and frosted over the rim.

Nora pulled her chair close to the window, sitting down as far away from the door as possible without leaving the table. She took a sip of her coffee and gazed out at the desert. She tried not to think about the danger lurking just beyond those hills.

Nora had grown up in a small town in Indiana, where everything was familiar. There were only two main roads leading out of town, and the rest of the place was farmland that grew corn and soybeans. She'd never seen anything like this planet before coming here. It seemed so different from Earth.

But it wasn't the same as a new world. This planet was the same age, after all. Nora knew how to work with what she had available. That's why she excelled in engineering—she made do with what she had.

Nora took another sip of coffee and looked out across the fields, trying to get her thoughts organized. Her mind drifted back to when she first arrived. She remembered being overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place. It was an imposing sight, even from a distance.",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
29,0.7,1.0,0.9,84.0,5,48.0,"At least the air smelled fresh outside, even if it was still cold. A foggy haze blanketed the landscape, obscuring the sky overhead. She could see only a few meters in front of her, but she didn't need to worry about being lost. The colony's layout was simple and well known.

The first thing she noticed when stepping out of the dormitory were the lights. Each dorm was dimmer than the last. At the end of each hall, the lights were at their lowest level. Nora had always wondered why the colonists kept the lights so low, knowing full well that it would make night activities difficult. She figured it must be for safety reasons.

But now she knew what they did to conserve energy. If the lights went out, the colony wouldn't know. She'd have to find the nearest generator room and hope there wasn't a fire or something worse going on. And Nora didn't like those odds.

She shivered. She wore thick gloves, a hooded coat, and the heavy utility pants. But it was still too cold for her bare feet. With a sigh, she trudged back toward the dormitories.

She entered the command center and took a seat in front of the computer console, which glowed with an amber light. It was the only functional terminal available here in this part of the complex.

With a few clicks of her fingers, she opened the door to her personal data files and accessed the Company's records. She skimmed through the files, looking for the most recent communications. There was no way to filter them by time or priority, but Nora found what she wanted.

There. The latest message from Company headquarters. She opened the file.

Dear Dr. Decker,

We are pleased to inform you that your position has been upgraded to Chief Engineer. You will report directly to me upon your return from your scheduled leave.

Sincerely,

Sully Carmichael

Nora stared at the words for a long moment before closing the file. Then she typed in her password and opened the next file. This one was dated three days ago.

The first thing she saw on the screen was a video message. It showed a middle aged man with thinning hair standing behind an ornate desk. His eyes were gray, his skin pale and wrinkled. He looked ill, but Nora knew he wasn't sick.

He wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and a black tie.",0.22806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

She paused in front of the entrance to the dormitory and glanced around. Other colonists were beginning to filter in, but they were a few minutes behind Nora. Most were still asleep, heads lolling on their chests like the sleeping animals from the jungle scenes depicted in old films.

Nora looked toward the stairs leading to the second floor where the colony's infirmary was located, then turned back to face the doorway. The hallway beyond it led deeper into the structure. A quick glance up and down the corridor showed her a couple of people passing along it.

There weren't many other colonists awake yet. Nora headed for the dining room, which was bustling with activity despite its relatively sparse population. At first, Nora felt a little awkward about entering the room while everyone else remained in bed. She considered turning back again and going to the cafeteria instead, but she needed to eat something before leaving the colony or she would get too weak. Besides, the mess hall had better food.

As Nora entered the dining area, a short, stocky man with dark skin and thick hair cut short in front caught her attention. He wore the same kind of coveralls Nora did; they hung loosely on him, showing his muscular frame beneath. His face was sunburned and he carried an energy drink can in one hand as he walked past the long tables to a counter at the far end of the room.

Nora watched him go without thinking, but when she looked up from behind a plate full of bacon and eggs, she saw another man standing across from her. He wore a white lab coat over a pair of black trousers.

The man stepped away from the counter to approach Nora.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

They both turned to look as Nora passed them in silence, their expressions grim. The older man looked back at Nora without speaking, his eyes cold and hard. She knew he blamed her for the Colony's problems—and rightly so.

Nora kept to herself while she made her way through the colony, working quietly and efficiently to fix problems where she found them. This was her job. Her duty to the community.

Nora Decker. Born on Earth, raised on Mars, and now living on Presley's Promise with a handful of other colonists. She wasn't one of the Company's employees, but they'd saved her life when her ship crashed out here three years ago, and now she owed them for that. But as much as she liked the idea of being paid to do what she loved, Nora didn't really expect it would come to pass anytime soon.

The colonists were still just beginning to understand how well-developed the alien hive was. It had been dormant since the arrival of the colonists, who hadn't seen any evidence of it before then. But even though it had stayed quiet for years, it wasn't dead. There was always a chance that the hive might be reawakened again, and if that happened...

She shuddered at the thought, and kept moving.

Nora paused outside her lab to look up and down the hallway. All clear. She pushed open the door and stepped inside. A lone light bulb hung from a wire in the ceiling, casting harsh shadows around the room. The air was hot and humid, and carried the smells of ozone and antiseptic. Nora breathed deeply as she turned her attention to the equipment that filled the room. Her engineering team did a great job maintaining the power plant and generating enough electricity for the colony's needs, but there wasn't much else they could do about their own systems.

Nora scanned the room with eyes accustomed to scanning through thick dust clouds.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

A few minutes later Nora entered the command center for the main operations deck where Sully sat at a console watching the feed from the security cameras and listening to reports. He glanced up when he saw Nora enter the room, then rose with a smile to shake her hand.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted him cheerfully. ""How's your shift going?""

Sully shrugged noncommittally. ""The usual. I'm sure you've noticed.""

Nora nodded. ""I know. It's always busy on the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels of the colony.""

He gestured to the screen showing a view of the corridor outside her quarters. ""You're not kidding. That swarm of drones is still out there. They won't give up.""

""They'll get bored eventually,"" Nora assured him. She watched as one of the drones wandered around the corner. The sight made her shiver. She felt like she could feel its barbed tail probing for a weakness in the hull.

The drone was a large, black insectoid thing with dozens of jointed legs and an oval body covered in thin scales. The creature looked vaguely humanoid but was built for speed and aggression. It walked on two legs, but the other four limbs were thick, multi-jointed, and tipped with a nasty looking set of curved talons.

The drone waddled toward Nora's door, swiveling its head from side to side as if it sensed something that had spooked the rest of the swarm. When it reached the door, it stopped and raised a front leg up to tap on the wood paneling.

""What the hell?"" Sully muttered. ""It can't open the door.""

Nora stood transfixed as the drone used its claw to slide the lock plate aside, then tapped again.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

The air inside the dining area was warm and stale but not hot. Nora could feel moisture on her face from the misting overhead vents, which she hoped would clear soon enough for them to heat up the water. The lights were dimmed. Most colonists only used the lights when they slept or ate, saving power until their needs demanded it.

Nora found the door to the cafeteria, entered, and walked toward the long, curving tables. She could see the end of one table where several colonists sat together around a large, round machine. Its surfaces glowed softly blue in the muted lighting. Nora couldn't make out any details other than that it looked like a computer.

She sighed. The colonists had been working on repairing or replacing it since the last supply ship arrived two weeks ago. With no new equipment coming in, Nora's job was to keep the old stuff going.

As she approached, Nora heard conversation between the colonists break off and then resume. She paused at the end of the table. They didn't look up as Nora moved past them. One man spoke quietly, so Nora leaned closer, trying to hear him over the hum and whirr of machinery. His words were indistinct.

""The drones are back,"" he said. ""I don't know what they're doing. There shouldn't be more than ten in this area.""

Nora tensed. The drone was an aggressive and voracious creature. She knew that from the Company database. Drones attacked the colonists without provocation, hunting and killing them indiscriminately.

The man continued his low voice. ""... I think we've got it under control for now though.""

That didn't sound good. Nora frowned and edged her way along the table. The other colonists looked up at her, startled when they saw her approach.

She caught one of their gazes and hesitated.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

His skin was dark and tan, with deep lines around his eyes. He had thick black hair, and a strong jawline beneath full, expressive lips.

He smiled at her, but Nora did not return the gesture. She stared back, looking for signs of deception. But Sully's expression showed nothing beyond friendly curiosity.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I don't have time to show you around the colony today. This is a big day.""

Nora nodded, still wary of him. ""You're leaving?"" She felt an unexpected stab of disappointment.

Sully shrugged, then gestured down the hall. ""There are other people who want to see this place, too. We're all eager to make a living out here, aren't we? And the Company will be sending ships soon enough. But before they arrive there's something important we need to do.""

Nora followed him through the corridors of the colony, past a handful of sleeping colonists, and into the main concourse. A few people were already gathered at a long table near the far wall, taking breakfast from metal trays. Most of them looked up as Nora and Sully entered.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

Nora walked the length of the hall, stepping around clusters of laundry bags piled along the walls where the colonists shared their dirty clothes. She reached a stoplight junction of three corridors. One led to the cafeteria, another to the mess hall, and the third to the garage.

This section of the colony had been built underground to protect the human population from the dangerous environment above. The tunnels were long and twisted, leading from the command center deep into the rocky crags where they emerged in several places near the surface.

Nora hesitated for a moment before turning into the tunnel that would lead her toward the garage. She didn't want to go this way today. If she went straight down to the garage, it wouldn't take more than a few minutes to get there. But if she headed up the tunnel, she'd be lost in the maze of twisting passageways.

She made her decision. Nora turned into the tunnel and followed it deeper into the dark.

The narrow, curving corridor was lit only by occasional glowing strips along the ceiling where emergency lights burned despite the fact that power was out elsewhere on the complex. The air was close, thick with stale smoke and dust from ancient equipment. Nora coughed once or twice, but at least the stench masked the smell of the eggs.

Ahead, she could hear water dripping somewhere deep within the rocks. The sound grew louder until it became a steady stream. She moved faster, eager to reach the next junction and escape from the claustrophobic tunnel.

Nora stopped short when she rounded a corner. A wall of green slime blocked her path, oozing up over the floor like an ugly carpet. At first glance, she thought it looked like fresh vomit. But the color and texture were wrong.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
36,0.75,1.0,0.9,87.0,5,49.0,"The hallways were quiet as she walked past empty rooms on either side. The dormitories had already been cleaned up for the day, and their occupants gone back to work. A few colonists slept in the rec rooms where they could, but most worked. Some of them stayed late. Most didn't.

Ahead of her was the mess hall. Its long tables were covered by red plastic sheets. Nora paused for a moment, wondering what the other colonists ate. In fact, she wondered if any of them ever got fed at all.

There was another option available to her. She could go to the cafeteria where most people ate, but only after she had eaten. She was so hungry that she didn't care.

After walking through the door, Nora found herself in an immense room with many tables lined with chairs. There were no windows, just a few lamps providing dim illumination from the ceiling.

It smelled like food.

Nora entered cautiously. Her eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light as she scanned the crowd of humans filling the dining area. Everyone was wearing coveralls and hard hats, some even carrying tools. But nobody appeared to be doing anything productive. They all sat there staring blankly into space or down at their hands.

They looked so similar, it was impossible to tell one person from another. Their faces were pale white and lean. Their hair varied from short to shaggy. All of them were thin, except for the few who stood out as noticeably overweight.

Their eyes all looked dead. No one was smiling or talking. Even when a few colonists began singing, the sound seemed forced. The words sounded odd in this setting; they weren't familiar songs. It was almost unsettling to hear voices raised at all.

The silence made Nora uneasy. She had never seen so many people act so... vacant.

A woman walked past her, then another man. Both wore coveralls, but neither of their clothes fit them. They were loose around the waist and shoulders. And both of them had dark circles under their eyes.

Nora stared at the pair, wondering if she should ask about them.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
38,0.75,1.0,0.9,78.0,8,47.0,"The halls were empty, but the corridors still echoed to the sound of her footsteps as she hurried to catch up with the rest of the colonists. The Company had set up separate shifts for everyone in the colony, so Nora was one of just two people awake at this early hour, and the only one not already working.

She caught the scent of food from somewhere ahead. The smell was faint but tantalizing. Nora wondered if the Company had stocked up on supplies to keep their staff fed during the long winter months.

A few minutes later, a door opened to reveal the commissary. A line of colonists was waiting outside, looking more like refugees than prospectors or explorers. They shuffled along with slumped shoulders and drooping heads as they moved through the doorway into a narrow corridor that led deeper inside the colony.

Nora hesitated, wondering what the colonists did for entertainment here when there wasn't much else to do. She hadn't really thought about it before because she'd been too busy focusing on surviving.

But now, she found herself curious. As Nora waited in line with the other colonists, she watched them enter and begin picking over stacks of metal trays piled high with food items. These were their meals for the day. The Company provided rations, but everyone had to choose their own food from the many options available.

Nora eyed the trays and realized most of the colonists preferred protein bars. These came in a variety of flavors, some made from dried meat, nuts, grains, and vegetables. Some even contained bits of chocolate.

The Company had stocked up on supplies to last the colonists until the next supply ship arrived, but that didn't mean they could be picky. Nora's stomach gurgled at the prospect of filling her empty belly.

Nora glanced around at the other colonists. They looked exhausted, hungry, and generally depressed. A couple of the men were nursing wounds from yesterday's attack. The colony had been attacked twice before.

After a few moments, Nora approached the counter and took the topmost tray. She held it up to scan its contents and found nothing objectionable. Satisfied with her choice, she stepped back out into the corridor and headed in the direction of the nearest hydroponic greenhouse.

Nora had volunteered to take this shift because she was good with electronics and had a knack for fixing things. But now, with the sun barely over the horizon, she needed to use every minute of daylight while it lasted. She hurried down the corridors and rounded a corner when a small drone popped up out of hiding near her feet. It scuttled forward, raising itself up on its spider legs. Its carapace glittered like polished silver as it raised a clawed hand at Nora in warning.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
39,0.75,1.0,0.9,82.0,6,46.0,"The colony's central kitchen was a long, rectangular room filled with counters and sinks running along the walls and a single large serving table in the center. The floor was tile, and the ceiling had been painted white to reflect the morning sun. A row of walk-in cupboards stood at either end, stacked high with dishes and foodstuffs.

A few colonists were already there, sitting around the table drinking coffee. Nora joined them, grabbing a cup from one of the shelves. As she walked over to the counter and filled the cup with hot water, she watched two women chatting nearby. They wore the same utilitarian clothing as her, but theirs were slightly more fitted.

The taller woman caught sight of Nora, smiled, and said something that made the other woman laugh. The first woman waved goodbye, then turned back toward the table to finish what they'd been talking about.

Nora wasn't sure why she felt so awkward in her own skin. She liked people, especially friendly ones like these women. But it was hard not to feel exposed in her utility clothes. The fabric kept away the cold, but the seams left little to the imagination.

She took a deep breath to steady herself and reminded herself that she was safe for now. These women couldn't see through her clothes, and no one else had yet come into the kitchen.

The water boiled, and Nora lifted the steaming mug to her lips. Hot coffee flooded down her throat, and she sighed appreciatively. The bitter flavor woke up her taste buds and settled her stomach. The ache of hunger dulled.

She leaned over the counter, watching the women talk and laughing together. One of them, a short brunette with curly hair, glanced at Nora before she turned back to the other woman. She smiled when she saw Nora looking, then looked away again quickly.

The other woman noticed her attention, too. She flushed, said something, and laughed nervously. Her friend rolled her eyes, but she still chuckled. Then the taller woman spoke up, making the shorter woman look even more uncomfortable.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora mumbled to herself. ""It's just..."" She trailed off.",0.2780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
40,0.8,1.0,0.9,94.0,8,45.0,"The corridor outside the dormitories was lit by bright yellow lights strung along the ceiling like luminous vines, but the rest of the hallways were dark. The dimly glowing lights were too feeble to illuminate the dust that hung in every corner and crusted across the low overhead panels.

It made sense for a colony so far from human space to run on the same power grid that kept the cities of Earth running, but it was always odd to see such an advanced society fail to adopt modern conveniences.

In the distance, the steady rumble of machinery echoed through the complex. That was the source of the noise Nora had heard earlier when she woke up. She turned her head to peer down the dark corridor toward the command center. Her eyes adjusted enough to make out the faint glow of the monitors in the office at the end of the hall.

She passed the large dining room, where colonists ate communal meals together, and descended a long flight of stairs into the lower level of the building. The first floor was crowded with corridors leading away from the stairwell.

Nora headed down one hallway, passing darkened offices and empty conference rooms, until she found the door that led to the cafeteria. She pushed it open and stepped inside. The lights were off, but the table lamps glowed weakly and cast a dim red light over the deserted room. Nora moved forward to check out the food dispensers as she took stock of the other inhabitants.

The only person present was a man sitting in one corner. He sat slumped in his chair, staring at nothing. As Nora approached, he glanced at her with dull eyes and then looked away again. Nora knew him from the infirmary.

""Good morning,"" she said quietly. ""I'm here to get my breakfast.""

He didn't answer.

Nora sighed. She opened her menu and began scrolling through the selection of items available. The list was divided into three categories: proteins, carbohydrates, and fruits/vegetables. A healthy option for each category would give her more energy than just a sugary snack.

Protein options included meats such as beef and pork, along with various cuts of fish. Carbohydrate choices ranged from whole grains like bread to starchier foods like potatoes. Some vegetables were also listed as an option in the protein section.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
41,0.8,1.0,0.9,78.0,6,47.0,"The dormitory hallway seemed darker than usual. The ceiling lights were off, and the walls glowed faintly blue-green in the faint light from the star outside. Sully was already at the entrance to the mess hall, where he stood chatting with a couple other colonists. He looked up when she came out of her room, smiled briefly, and nodded.

She passed him by without acknowledging his presence as she headed for the cafeteria and food.

The dining area had been built inside one of the largest greenhouses. A long table filled the entire space with enough room left over for several dozen seats. Several of the chairs had been shoved against the wall to accommodate tall tables. All around the perimeter of the greenhouse, shelves held dozens of glass pots holding seedlings in different stages of growth.

Nora sat at the end of the rightmost side of the long table and opened her plate with a practiced motion, setting it down next to her fork. She poured herself a cup of water from the pot beside her chair and took a slow drink while she waited for the meal to arrive.

The lights dimmed as the doors slid open. The first thing Nora noticed was the absence of any other colonists. Then, she spotted the cook and dishwasher coming through the swinging door. They both wore crisp white uniforms and stood aside to let a couple people pass them by before they entered the room.

Nora frowned as she watched them enter and take their places at the far end of the table. She was too early for breakfast, but it didn't matter; the kitchen crew were already serving themselves. As they did, one of them looked up. Their eyes met for just an instant. There was something wrong about the look on her face...

Something that made Nora pause with the fork halfway to her mouth.

Her instincts kicked in. In a single motion, Nora snatched her plate out of its place, turned away from the table, and fled into the hallway, dashing past Sully as she went.

""Nora!"" he called after her. ""Where are you going?""

She ignored him as she ran down the hall, heading toward the elevator.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
42,0.8,1.0,0.9,83.0,5,48.0,"The hallway outside the door was dimly lit by recessed lights. The hum of machinery made it hard to hear over the background noise from the colony. It also reminded her of the first time she came through the main entrance. Then she was fresh out of school, anxious to prove herself as an engineer. Now she was responsible for keeping them alive on this desolate planet.

It seemed like a lifetime ago.

She passed several colonists, each going about their own business. Their faces were dark in shadow, illuminated only by the occasional gleam off reflective surfaces. They wore sleeveless shirts, long pants, and sandals instead of boots. They all looked up at her, some with surprised expressions, others with wary suspicion.

Nora frowned as they watched her pass. It wasn't fair that they should stare when she had to work so hard. She tried not to feel self-conscious and continued down the corridor. At the end, she stopped and turned to check in both directions. When there was no sign of any aliens lurking around the corner, Nora started again.

Her footsteps echoed faintly in the hall. It was cool outside now, but the air smelled sweet and clean in contrast to the stale reek of last night's dinner. The sun was rising beyond the foggy haze, casting faint highlights across the landscape. The ground underfoot crunched softly as she walked through crisp, dry grasses. Nora breathed deep and savored the fragrant wind.

She'd been out in this world before. Back on Earth. But only once. Her life hadn't turned out the way it was supposed to, so her parents moved her back home after high school. Then, when she came of age, they set her up with a job and some money to get started. It was the start of something good for her, but... well, that didn't matter anymore.

Ahead lay the main entrance, and Nora slowed to peer in through the glass doors that were bolted shut at all times. From inside, an automated voice spoke over the intercom, announcing the time and informing colonists of the day's schedule.

Nora frowned as she listened to it. This was a new schedule, and she needed to check and make sure it matched what Eve said the Company wanted.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
43,0.8,1.0,0.9,88.0,6,42.0,"The walkway to the dormitories was lit by a single overhead bulb casting dim, harsh yellow illumination over the concrete. As she passed under it, Nora's eyes adjusted to the darkness. The dormitory buildings were dark, empty places now. After their morning shifts ended, colonists went home.

As she turned at the end of one long corridor, her footsteps echoing off the cold wall beside her, Nora looked up at the looming shadows cast by the towering cliff face. There was nothing else here but rock, metal, and dust.

The wind blew along her path, rippling her coat and rustling her hair. At the far end of the dormitory building, Nora heard the faint murmur of voices in the rec room.

She quickened her pace, walking faster and more confidently than she had since arriving on the planet. She held herself upright and confident, ready for anything. Her pulse raced with excitement and anticipation. Nora knew she was in the best shape possible.

Nora stopped as she reached the door to the communal showers. She leaned close to the opening, peering inside, waiting impatiently. A stream of water poured down from overhead pipes and splashed into a large basin, filling it. Nora waited patiently. It wasn't long before she could hear the hiss of steam rising above the sound of the shower.

As she pulled open the door, Nora glanced around the dim interior of the shower area. Steam swirled up in billowing clouds. A few colonists stood around the edge, looking out across the floor at the other end of the room. Some of them spoke softly to each other, and some just stared at the dark, damp wall opposite them. All were clad only in soiled clothes.

Nora stepped inside.

The heat shocked her skin, forcing her to pull her shirt over her head and peel off the jacket and utility pants. She tossed both items aside with a grimace. Nora winced as she peeled the thin fabric away from her body, exposing her bare torso to the chilly air.

She'd hoped to be able to get in a quick rinse and shower before starting her work shift. But that was impossible now; she'd have to wait until after her shift.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
44,0.8,1.0,0.9,83.0,5,50.0,"The main dormitory area was at the end of the hallway from her room. The hall itself was long, but the rooms were narrow and crowded together. Each one had its own small bathroom near the entrance. On either side of the passage was a row of single-occupancy beds separated by privacy screens.

Nora moved through the hall, peering into each door. She reached the last room on the right. With a sigh she entered.

A quick glance around showed Nora a few other colonists sitting up in their bedding or lounging in the corner. No one else seemed to be awake yet. She stepped into the room, closing the door behind her. A faint, warm light came from the dimness of the ceiling fixtures. Nora felt like she was in a dark cave.

She turned back to face the door. She looked around, trying to get accustomed to the shadows and low light.

Nora frowned as her eyes adjusted. The overhead lights were off and no light seeped under the doors from the hall. She hadn't seen this before. Had there been a blackout or power failure? Was it the fault of the equipment? Or had the generator quit working? If so, when would the next supply ship arrive?

Nora's mind drifted back to her nightmares. Those creatures had killed more than one person. She didn't think she could sleep again tonight.

She walked toward the center of the room. There were three bunk beds set in a row. The other two bunks appeared vacant, but Nora sensed someone was nearby. She glanced over at the door to her right. The privacy screen was partially open and revealed only darkness beyond. She crept closer.

""Hello?"" Nora said tentatively. ""Anyone awake?""

There was no answer.

Nora sighed and sat on the edge of her bed, wondering what she should do with herself for the rest of the day. Maybe she'd better go see if anyone needed help.

Nora rose to her feet and crossed the room to pull the door open. She paused to peek outside, seeing no one. When she stepped out into the hall, the corridor was empty and dark.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

The crew had made sure to wear their best smiles when they watched her pass, hoping for a glimpse of the woman who worked so hard to keep them alive.

She wasn't afraid anymore. But that didn't mean she wanted to be noticed by anyone. Not after seeing what happened to the last engineer who got too close.

The door slid open as Nora approached, revealing the same dingy room she'd seen in her dreams. Her breath caught as she gazed around, wondering how many more times this room would greet her eyes today. Then the reality of it crashed down on her again.

It was a filthy, dank space filled with stacked crates and rusted machinery. Nora looked up from her place near the far wall to avoid bumping into anything and shuddered. The pipes overhead dripped water. Steam escaped the vents along the walls in thick clouds. A faint yellow light flickered beneath the grating.

Nora's gaze wandered over the dirty, broken floor where the concrete had cracked underfoot. At least it was clean enough for her to see her own footprints.

The sound of the door sliding closed behind Nora startled her back into alertness. She turned, ready to demand a reason for shutting the door so quickly. Instead she found herself staring at another face, one with sad eyes and thin, pale skin. It belonged to a woman with dark hair gathered in a ponytail at the nape of her neck.

""Morning,"" Nora said. ""Did I wake you?""

The woman looked up with a wince. Her eyes were red and puffy from lack of sleep. When she spoke, her voice was hoarse. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb..."" She trailed off and shook her head. ""You're new. I've never seen anyone as nice as you before.""

She took a shaky breath and straightened up, nodding once.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
46,0.8,1.0,0.9,82.0,5,47.0,"The dormitory hallways were quiet. Aside from the steady thump-thumping of the alarm, the building held a dead silence. Even the faint echo of Nora's boots as she walked echoed off the concrete walls like ghosts. The halls felt more like tunnels than rooms, narrow corridors cut through solid rock by the colonists' ingenuity and determination.

Nora reached the end of her hallway. A small room waited there—the communal kitchen, a place for gathering during the short break between shifts.

The door opened with a creak, spilling a stream of golden sunlight across the dusty floor. Nora squinted at the brightness, turning in slow circles while taking in the room.

""Hey,"" someone called softly as she turned to face the doorway. ""You're up early.""

A tall man stepped into view from around the corner, framed in brilliant yellow light. He wore the same type of clothing Nora did, though his jacket was black and fitted tight around the chest. His dark hair hung over one eye in a disheveled mop.

Nora recognized him, but he seemed so distant. So far away from her that it made no sense to say anything. She didn't even know what she wanted to say. Her gaze shifted down to the pistol holstered on his hip, then back up again.

""I don't think you should be wearing that outside your quarters, Nora,"" said the man.

Nora blinked in surprise and stepped forward. The man was smiling, but there was a hardness about him now, a coldness she hadn't seen before.

He's afraid...

She felt an odd twinge of fear herself when she realized this, like the world had suddenly become smaller, harder.

""Are you trying to give me a heart attack?"" Nora asked dryly, staring at the gun. She glanced past the stranger, looking around the kitchen. The room seemed so bright, the sun shining directly through the window.

The man shrugged. ""Do I look like a nutjob? You're the one who called my name.""

Nora bit her lip and nodded. ""Yeah, sorry. I just got up. What's going on out there?""

The man leaned against the doorframe.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
47,0.8,1.0,0.9,87.0,6,45.0,"The morning chill was still cold from the night air, but a rising sun cast its warming rays across the land. The colony was surrounded by a few scraggly trees in scattered groves, their branches reaching high above to scrape against the stars. The air smelled like pine needles, not yet ripe enough to scent the dew on the ground.

Nora's boots crunched on the gravel of the main concourse. She walked down the middle of the open area, her footsteps echoing off the walls. On either side of the wide corridor were the other two wings of the colony; the dormitories stretched out to her right and the laboratories and power plant to her left.

The laboratories were at the end of the main concourse, separated from the rest of the colony by a thick layer of wall and windows. A security station stood at each end of the corridor that served as a checkpoint. But Nora wasn't worried about getting caught. Her access card allowed her through the checkpoints without trouble.

The doors to the labs were open when Nora arrived, so she let herself in and started to walk down the hallways inside. She glanced at her wristwatch. Her shift wouldn't start for another hour. She could get an early breakfast if she hurried.

Her boots made the familiar metallic thud of every step on the hard flooring. The corridor was dim with a soft glow lighting the way, casting long shadows from the overhead lights. It looked like a deserted town. Nora shivered. She couldn't imagine how anyone lived down here.

Nora followed the hallway down the stairs to the ground level. The large metal door marked the entrance to the power plant. Nora pushed it open and stepped into its light. The room was expansive, filled with towering, heavy machinery. Nora walked over to the nearest machine and peered at it.

It was a fusion reactor, but a much smaller one than the ones used in space stations. This device didn't produce the amount of energy necessary to run the colony. Instead, it provided a small fraction of the power needed to keep everything running.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

Nora headed out of the dormitory toward the dining hall. After what she'd gone through yesterday, she hadn't expected to get much sleep last night.

But the colony had been up all night, trying to fix the power problem. She hoped they didn't get any more sleep today.

She passed other colonists heading the same way. Most of them nodded at her or spoke briefly. Nora returned the greetings with a casual wave as she hurried past. She couldn't waste time chatting when her first job was fixing one of the power plants.

The sun rose higher in the sky, chasing away lingering fog from the previous day. By midmorning, the temperature began to rise, and the humidity increased to make clothes stick to skin. But Nora's hair dried quickly in the warm breeze.

At lunchtime, the din of people talking, eating, and arguing filled the corridors. She followed a trail of food wrappers to the mess hall. A few familiar faces sat around the tables, including several of the younger engineers who had worked on the power plant.

""Hey,"" someone called as Nora entered. ""There you are.""

A tall man with dark black hair stood up and waved to her. Nora smiled in recognition. The man's name was Joe O'Grady, the Chief Engineer for the power plant. Nora knew him because she'd been his assistant back when she was a kid. He didn't wear his engineering hat anymore, but she could see it on the shelf behind him.

O'Grady led Nora over to the table. ""I thought I recognized your voice!"" he said.

Nora shook hands with her former mentor. ""How have things been going?""

""Oh, great. We're getting close to fixing the power problem. No more night shifts. And they say we might get another ship in next week or two.""

Nora frowned. ""I guess this is what you call 'good news.' There's always something wrong. Maybe a month from now there won't be any power at all.""

""Not unless someone comes up with a miracle,"" O'Grady said.",0.32806122448979624,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

Nora stopped at the end of her hall, opened one of the many doors, and stepped out onto a narrow ramp. It led up to the next level. The other residents had already left for work, leaving Nora to trudge through the cold air alone.

The colony's corridors were set apart from each other by several floors in height. The upper levels didn't have windows, but were still bright and filled with activity. They contained labs, manufacturing facilities, and power plants. These uppermost levels also held apartments where the colonists lived in privacy and comfort while on duty.

At ground level, Nora walked along a short corridor lined with storage lockers. She passed a few empty rooms until she reached the garage area, then turned right and entered another small hallway that ended at a large door marked ""Bathroom."" The room inside was cramped and utilitarian, but better than most of the rooms in the colony. The floor was metal grating, not carpet. The walls were covered with a metallic mesh. A few potted shrubs grew in the corners.

Nora went straight to the sink and washed her face before stepping into the tiny shower cubicle. Water pounded from overhead nozzles. Nora quickly lathered herself and rinsed off under the scalding spray, which doused the sweat and dirt clinging to her body.

The two men responded in kind, but they were distracted; one of them had a clipboard propped on the counter, and the other was talking to Sully. Nora knew he was the colony's primary administrator because she could hear him clearly over the hum of the equipment.

She paused at the doorway to listen.

""... not see why I have to take over this engineering department,"" a man said. ""I'm good enough to run my own crew.""

Sully chuckled. ""Well, you are good enough. Just don't let your ego get in the way of the job. You're here for management experience, remember?""

""Oh, sure. And I know everything there is about the systems, but nobody tells me what those damn machines actually do. They only tell me what they can do—not how!""

A woman joined them. She was a dark-skinned Latina with short black hair and large brown eyes. Her voice was gentle and warm, and she smiled at Sully. ""Carmichael? Is this where we find the chief engineer?""

Nora blinked in surprise, having completely forgotten about her. A grin spread across her face as recognition dawned. ""Hola! Señorita Rodriguez. You work down in the plant?""

The young woman nodded. ""Yes, I'm a mechanic. My name's Maria Rodriguez.""

""We were just catching up,"" Carmichael said. He waved to Nora and grinned again. ""I'm glad you got off early, Nora. How about some breakfast with us? We'll have fresh rolls and coffee ready in five minutes if you're hungry.""

At the end of the hallway, she found the community's main food supply in the form of a large central building. Past this was a small courtyard that offered access to the kitchen, greenhouses, power plant, garage, and dormitories. In the distance, through a gap in a nearby cliff face, Nora caught sight of the sun rising above the mountains.

Nora smiled as she stepped into the communal dining room. She'd gotten used to seeing her companions there, even though she didn't eat regularly. The other colonists had been surprised at first, then quickly embraced their new engineer. They laughed at Nora's jokes and helped her with mechanical repairs. Some were friendly in a brotherly way, others reserved for business reasons. But they welcomed her, even if she was the only woman on the planet.

A quick glance around the busy dining hall showed that most colonists would be sitting down to breakfast soon. As she passed the buffet line, Nora glanced at the wide selection of foods lined up on a cart near the entrance. Eggs, pancakes, fried potatoes, bacon, sausage, cereal, and more. She sighed in satisfaction, taking out a plate from one of the counters where a couple of workers polished silverware as she headed to the line.

In addition to being the best-engineer in the colony, Nora also happened to be very skilled at making friends. That was probably why the Company assigned her to this project. The colonists liked working with her. It helped that she made people feel safe and comfortable.

Her efforts paid off here, as did the fact that Nora could always rely on another's help when she needed it. People were always happy to lend a hand, and Nora knew how to get it back if she repaid them in kind.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
53,0.85,1.0,0.9,80.0,7,47.0,"The colony's halls were dimly lit in red emergency lights. The air smelled stale from disuse. At least the colonists had learned to use the communal showers, she reminded herself.

As she walked the length of the hallways, she came upon a handful of people heading in different directions. Everyone carried a tool pouch or satchel over their shoulders. These colonists weren't quite up yet, but there wasn't time to wait around for them.

Nora moved at the front of the crowd, her boots scuffing slightly on the synthetic carpeting. The hallways were narrow, so when the colonists crowded too close together they became one file. As a result, Nora had to duck under arms and limbs as she squeezed past them. It seemed an endless crawl.

The walk took longer than she expected due to her own inattentiveness, but soon the sounds of other people talking and the smell of food drifted through the corridors. After a few more turns, she reached another set of doors that opened into the cafeteria.

This section of the colony was fully equipped with a dining hall and kitchen for catering large gatherings. The room buzzed with talk, laughter, and clanging pots. A group of men gathered outside the stove while three women clustered around it in heated discussion. In between, a young man sat slumped in his chair, head on his chest, snoring quietly.

Nora turned right and followed the line of colonists out into the hall again. She walked past the wide central concourse, which ran across the length and breadth of the colony. As she rounded the corner, she passed an open doorway where a woman leaned against one wall. Nora slowed her steps as she approached.

The woman's dark hair and black eyes were just like Nora's, but there was something about the way she held herself, arms folded and leaning back against the doorframe, that made her stand out in the crowd. The woman watched Nora from the corner of her eye with an intent stare.

Nora paused when she drew near enough to see the woman more clearly. The woman wore a plain grey jumpsuit that bore the name tag'Rosa'. Her shoulders hunched, and her head cocked slightly at an awkward angle. There was no telling how long this woman had been standing in place, staring into space. A few other colonists were passing in the opposite direction, but they didn't notice Rosa.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
54,0.85,1.0,0.9,63.0,5,44.0,"Downstairs, she found Sully already at the table in the communal kitchen eating what looked like a slice of toast with jam and orange juice poured over it.

""What are you doing up?"" Sully asked, blinking bleary eyes. He set his toast aside, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and pointed to his stomach. ""I'm still hungry.""

Nora grimaced. She hated mornings. The whole routine was suffocatingly regimented. And the food wasn't bad... but it was also bland, and always the same.

She sat across from him, taking a deep breath. There were things to do. She sighed again as she grabbed her own fork.

This morning's meal was an omelet made with nutrient broth, some type of protein concentrate, egg yolk, and salt—all cooked into the eggs before serving. It was the only thing they got that might be considered edible, so it tasted pretty good most of the time, and today Nora liked how fresh and full her belly felt.

Nora glanced around the crowded room, looking for someone else. She couldn't see anyone.

Sully nodded toward her plate with a faint smile. ""Don't forget your breakfast.""

She blinked and took another bite. She didn't feel very hungry, but the smell of the food had awakened something in her stomach. She chewed slowly and swallowed before nodding agreement.

""Thanks,"" she said around a mouthful of egg and toast, which was actually pretty good.

Sully nodded absently and returned to his own breakfast, while Nora finished hers off and washed up. With a sigh she pulled her hair back into a ponytail. As she tied it with her belt, Nora realized Sully wasn't there anymore.

She looked around and caught sight of him walking down the hall toward the front door. When he reached it, he paused, and turned to look at her over his shoulder. She could barely make out the expression on his face as he lifted one hand in farewell. Nora sighed again, exasperated by her partner's habit of leaving before she woke up.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
55,0.85,1.0,0.9,87.0,4,44.0,"The hallways were dim and shadowed, though the floors were well-lit. The walls and ceiling were gray metallic plates bolted together in a complex honeycomb design. On either side of the hallway, small rectangular recessed openings allowed narrow corridors to the right and left of each wall. The spaces were about two meters wide, but only slightly taller than a man. Most were filled with storage lockers and service areas for the colonists' needs.

Nora passed through the open door at the end of her own corridor. She walked out onto the front porch, where she shivered as wind whipped across her face. Fog hovered over the ground like the ghosts of old wars, swirling around the bases of large rocks that protruded from the dirt.

""Morning,"" Nora greeted the colony manager, who was already waiting at the edge of one of these boulders. His name was John Stebbings. ""You're up early.""

""Not so early as you are."" He grinned. ""I got myself a cup of coffee while I waited. Want some?""

Nora smiled back. ""Sure.""

Stebbings handed her his steaming mug. She took it gratefully, inhaling deeply before taking a sip and wrinkling her nose in distaste. ""What is this? I'd swear it's battery acid if not for the sugar.""

He laughed. ""It's a mixture of caffeine and sugar. Keeps me awake. A little bitter, but worth the price. And don't worry. You'll get used to it. That said, we have more than enough for everyone here.""

She grunted. ""I'm not worried about that. More about the lack of food. I'll be lucky if my stomach doesn't revolt on me. Or worse, growl like an angry bear. What's that supposed to mean?""

Stebbings shook his head. ""Never mind. It'll keep. Don't forget your ration card."" He gestured toward a small pouch hanging around Nora's neck.

Nora paused in reaching up to take the card. ""My rations? For breakfast? But I had lunch yesterday.""

""Yeah,"" he said. ""Well... it's not like you're going hungry. We've got plenty of food in the storage units—we just don't want any of it to spoil.""

Her eyes narrowed.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
56,0.85,1.0,0.9,80.0,7,43.0,"Nora's legs felt like jelly when she left her room, but by the time she made it to the communal kitchen, she found herself moving with purpose. Her footsteps echoed off walls of hard surfaces in empty corridors, and a sense of cold pervaded the entire colony. But the colony's power plant still ran, so no lights were out.

The dining hall was packed to capacity. There wasn't even enough room for her to squeeze through. Nora picked up a tray and took a seat at one of the long tables. Several colonists passed her food, and they exchanged a nod or a wave. They were all busy with their own tasks. No one noticed her.

Nora ate quickly. By the time she finished, her stomach rumbled loudly enough to draw curious looks. It was true. The colonists were hungry; Nora could smell it in the air.

The hallways had been designed to be self-sufficient, including a vast network of pipes that distributed water and collected wastes. As she returned to her room, Nora noted how clean and well-maintained the infrastructure was. That was unusual, as the Company often overlooked maintenance. Even with a fully automated colony, someone should check on systems and equipment regularly.

She walked past a pair of engineering bays to an unoccupied set of doors. One of the large rooms was empty. Nora entered and closed the door behind her, then took a seat at the console. A thin layer of dust covered its surface. The room was dark. Nora waited for her eyes to adjust. After a few seconds, the display flickered into life, casting an orange glow over rows of switches and controls.

She pressed a control marked with a green circle. With a soft hum and a low whine, a massive power loader lowered itself from overhead and settled onto one of the floor's raised sections. The loader contained sophisticated motors, electronics, and hydraulics. Though they were heavy to move manually, it was simple to operate with a small touch screen. Nora stepped inside, sat down, and tapped the monitor to activate her loaders controls.

The loader began moving across the ground in slow jerky movements as Nora navigated through its menus. She paused when she found a submenu labeled 'load,' which allowed her to specify items and materials she wanted moved around. She searched through available options until she found what she was looking for.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
57,0.85,1.0,0.9,92.0,9,42.0,"The colony's main dining hall was open to the airy, windowless space at the heart of the complex. This central chamber was the site of community meetings, lectures, social gatherings, banquets, weddings... and breakfasts. All meals were communal affairs; colonists worked in shifts throughout the day to keep everyone fed. The Colony was divided into three different work schedules, one for each of the eight-hour periods. Breakfast always ran twenty minutes behind schedule because of the constant interruptions.

Nora crossed the corridor, following the noise to the breakfast room, and stood in line for a meal she rarely wanted to eat but felt obliged to take anyway. On her way back to her quarters, she passed through the small training gymnasium. Most of the time, this space was empty. It had served as an exercise area and meeting place when Presley's Promise was still under construction, but since its completion it had been relegated to storage.

Nora turned down the hallway toward her apartment. As usual, a few colonists lingered outside her door, waiting for their turns to use the communal shower. Nora had just stepped into the hall when the familiar sound of boots crunching gravel jerked her attention away from the other residents.

She stopped in place and peered around the corner at the intruder's approach. A tall man strode purposefully toward her with determined steps. He wore the same utilitarian uniform as Nora, and his dark hair was neatly parted on the left side above a broad forehead. His face was lean and clean shaven, though he'd left some stubble along his jawline to make him look more rugged.

He nodded brusquely in greeting. ""Good morning, Engineer Decker.""

""Mornin',"" she replied automatically. Her gaze roved over the stranger's body as she tried to remember who he was. In a flash, she realized. This was Sully Carmichael, the colony administrator and Chief Engineer, the person responsible for keeping everything working properly.

Sully always made her nervous.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
58,0.85,1.0,0.9,71.0,5,44.0,"The corridor was empty, as usual. As she approached the cafeteria, Nora heard voices drifting down from a high-ceilinged room just past the hall juncture—the colonists' recreation center.

Nora was surprised when she saw Sully standing outside the doorway, smiling and chatting with a young woman named Tessa. Her dark brown hair hung long over both shoulders like a curtain. She wore a white sleeveless tank top that showed off the curves of her toned arms and biceps. Nora guessed she was somewhere in her mid twenties with a small, neat nose, full lips, and wide eyes.

Sully must be dating now, Nora thought. He was always talking about Tessa, but she never let herself get too invested. It seemed like something he might do, but it wasn't fair to make assumptions about what his life had become. Nora knew firsthand how lonely this place could be, after spending so many months on the ground.

Nora hesitated. She wanted to ask him if she could use the bathroom first, then joined him and Tessa in the cafeteria. But the moment stretched into awkward silence as Nora struggled to find an opening to bring up her concerns.

Tessa glanced at her watch. ""Oh! I've got to run."" The girl smiled reassuringly. ""See you later!"" she said, breezing past Sully and heading down the hallway.

""I'll meet you guys there,"" Sully called after her. As Tessa hurried off, he turned to look for Nora again.

""Hey, Nora,"" he said. ""That's really nice of you to help out with the colony today.""

""It's no problem.""

""You want a ride back?""

Nora hesitated. ""Um, yeah.""

Sully frowned as he scanned the hall. ""It should be pretty easy to catch from here. I'll just head straight home. See you soon, okay?""

Nora nodded and watched him leave before she headed into the restroom to freshen up.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
59,0.85,1.0,0.9,75.0,7,41.0,"The corridor outside looked like any other on this side of the colony's main dome. She passed small laboratories, where colonists worked tirelessly at their tasks, and power plants that converted natural gas from pockets around the colony to electric current. The corridors were mostly dark, except for a few dim lamps lighting the way for people hurrying through the colony.

A few meters from the central dome, Nora slowed, catching sight of a familiar shape in the shadows. Her heart jumped as she walked toward it, knowing exactly what she was about to find.

Beside the stairs leading up to the command center sat an ancient power loader.

No one had seen fit to tell Nora that her best friend was dead. Her parents told her he was injured but would recover when they returned home from their mission. Nora found the silence awkward, even after so many days of working beside him. He'd been her first engineer, her only ally in the harsh isolation of Presley's Promise.

Nora's fingers tightened on the railing and paused a few steps short of the old machine. She forced herself to step forward, ignoring the heat that crept through her body and into her face. She stood beside the machine, feeling its rusted metal skin beneath her fingers. It was too hot to touch without discomfort, but the warmth made it seem almost alive.

With a sigh, Nora stepped away and pulled open the door. The air inside the chamber felt cool as she shut the door behind her and walked down the corridor to the garage. Inside, the loader's wide, armored doors were closed. Nora climbed the ladder, stepping through a hatch in the top of the loader. Her feet clanged loudly on the platform as she stopped, staring at the strange device.

It was like nothing she'd ever seen before.

The loader sat inside a cavernous bay. It looked large enough to accommodate several of the colony's ground vehicles. Atop the bay, cables hung from an iron grid, while a long, snaking umbilical extended out one end.

The other end of the loader jutted into the gloom beyond Nora's field of vision. Its curved end terminated in a thick, bulbous tube that swelled into the darkness.",0.3780612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
60,0.9,1.0,0.9,61.0,7,41.0,"On the landing outside the dormitory, she felt a sudden change in the air temperature as the breeze died. The atmosphere was noticeably cold, making her toes feel like they were frozen in place. She shivered slightly but fought the impulse to rub warmth back into them. With a deep breath, she started down the hall toward the communal showers.

When the lights flickered off at the end of the hall, Nora instinctively slowed to let other colonists pass her. The dim illumination cast shadows across her path and obscured what might be lurking on either side. It also made the corridor appear dark and sinister.

The faint glimmering from the next set of rooms didn't alleviate that impression. As she approached the flickering glow, Nora's foot caught on a loose floor tile and sent her stumbling forward. She regained balance with the added help of a wall. Without pausing to assess if it was safe, Nora stepped around the corner into the first room.

It wasn't completely dark, so long as she faced away from the light. Light streamed in from a window high up on one wall and a door beside it. She could hear the low hum of an electric current through the ceiling, indicating power lines or equipment running on backup batteries.

A single, bright point of orange light sat atop a metal desk. An oil lamp burned like the sun overhead. Its heat warmed her face.",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

A few colonists milled about and ate at round tables near the far wall where a handful of servers passed food around. Her fellow engineers clustered together near one corner where four more workers stood by waiting to serve them.

She entered the dining area. There was just enough time to take a quick cup of coffee before the workday began.

The serving girl's face turned toward her, but when Nora saw her eyes the girl smiled instead. Nora returned the smile tentatively, her heart pounding fast. For a moment, she forgot what she'd come to do.

Nora found a table that wasn't already occupied. She set down her coffee cup and sat, still trying not to stare at the server. She kept seeing the eyes of the dead men lying in a bloody pile back in her quarters.

A server placed food on the tabletop. As Nora reached for it, she realized she didn't know how much the meal cost. It probably cost a lot. But right now her budget was only limited by a few hundred dollars, most of which was already spent on necessities like food and rent.

Nora dug into the breakfast before her. The meal consisted of eggs, fried potatoes, bacon, bread with butter, and warm milk. After eating, she drank the last sips from her coffee cup.

A server approached again. ""You ready to start your shift?"" he asked.

""I am.""",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
62,0.9,1.0,0.9,85.0,7,44.0,"Down the hall, another engineer stood by the door to the mess hall. His head jerked up at her approach, face reddening in recognition, then he rushed across the room to open it. As she entered, Nora could smell the familiar mix of eggs, bacon, fresh-brewed coffee, and buttery toast wafting through the air. The low hum of conversation fell silent at Nora's entrance. She looked around the tables where colonists sat, eating quietly while they waited for their portions. Some stared at her as she walked down the center aisle between them, others watched her curiously from the edges of the crowd.

The sound of plates banging together as people moved through the line caught her attention, and Nora turned to see a young man filling his plate. He was dressed like many of the colonists—a pair of jeans and a plaid button-up shirt under a long coat. But his outfit looked better cared for than most. Nora studied him as he placed the plate on top of one that already held food and handed it off to someone behind him.

He glanced over his shoulder, noticing Nora as she approached. She paused in front of him with her back to him, not sure what to do next. This was the first time she had seen another person since arriving here. Her face remained blank, but she couldn't stop herself from glancing down at the plate.

With practiced motions, Nora took a forkful of the scrambled eggs she loved so much. She popped it in her mouth, chewing vigorously as she stared at the man. His features were sharp and attractive enough. The angular bones of his nose gave his forehead an unusual prominence.",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
63,0.9,1.0,0.9,85.0,7,45.0,"She descended a winding stairwell that connected the dormitory to the central engineering area below. Here, she found a small dining hall with three long tables occupied by colonists eating food. Many of them were men; they sat close together in a clique while women ate alone at the far end. In contrast to the well-worn uniforms worn for every other task, these people wore crisp and neat lab coats that looked brand new.

As Nora passed through the dining area, the diners paused from their meals to stare at her. A few stared openly, but most seemed confused and uncertain of why she was there.

For a moment she considered going back up to her room to grab some breakfast, but the idea of lingering near the table filled her with an urgent need for nourishment that drove her forward.

The kitchen, where Nora first encountered the alien drones, felt cramped despite the cavernous dimensions compared to what she expected. The wide doors opened to an enclosed chamber that held rows of work stations and storage racks alongside a large cooking hearth. But it wasn't just the size that surprised her.

It was how busy everything in here seemed to be. Food processors chugged, conveyors hummed, and robotic arms handled dozens of tasks at once. A crew of four people worked efficiently in the midst of the chaos, their faces grim and their expressions tired.

Nora stepped past a conveyor belt and into the crowded space. As she pushed through the swarm of workers, Nora made eye contact with two of them. They didn't return her gaze; they stared at her with glazed, vacant eyes. Nora's breath caught as she noticed something new.",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
65,0.9,1.0,0.9,60.0,9,50.0,"The halls were filled with colonists heading for the communal dining hall. Most wore coveralls like Nora, though few seemed to be wearing the latest fashion trends. Nora liked the old fashioned way people dressed out here. The uniforms let her know she was in a colony full of friends and neighbors.

When Nora entered the dining room, people sat at tables eating cereal while others chatted around a long table. They smiled greetings as Nora passed them. Everyone knew everyone else here; they'd come together when the Company brought the settlement to life and worked hard and cooperatively to get everything working as smoothly as possible.

The communal kitchen was set up on one side of the hall, so Nora could grab whatever food needed for break time quickly if she wasn't going to make it back in time. Some colonists joked about that; since most equipment couldn't take any power draw at all, this was something of an advantage. But most engineers preferred to be efficient rather than convenient.

Nora headed toward the kitchen, passing a wide array of open cupboards with neatly labeled containers inside. She scanned the labels. As much as she wanted to indulge in fresh fruits and pastries, her hunger won out over laziness and she took a jar of jam from the shelf. Jam was almost universally appreciated by people in this region because it kept well even without refrigeration, and despite the scarcity of other supplies the colonists weren't stingy with their fruit preserves.

While the kitchen might have been large enough to feed a small city, it looked no bigger than her average apartment back home. Nora grabbed a knife and a bowl for peeling fruit before heading through the door into the rest of the communal area.

A few paces down the hall were two large, glass-walled recreation rooms that had been converted into lounges to accommodate more colonists in smaller groups. In this room there were several tables arranged across the floor and along one wall. A group of three engineers sat talking at one of the long tables.",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

The colonists were not yet awake, but soon they'd begin the daily routine as Nora walked among the dark dormitories and barracks. They would be heading to their shifts at the power plant, engineering bay, mess hall, medical clinic, cafeteria, and a dozen other locations scattered around the complex.

Nora's footsteps echoed loudly in the vast space. She saw a few groups of workers hurrying towards the mess halls, though many more loitered aimlessly like Nora. Some sat alone on their beds. Others slept. Most simply watched the bleak landscape from within the narrow confines of their bunks, staring vacantly at nothing.

Nora turned back to her quarters, taking slow steps as she headed for the common showers and bathrooms down each hallway. A wave of exhaustion swept over her. She felt it coming on as she took in the stark scene outside her window, thinking of her warm bed and hot shower ahead of her.

She stopped dead in her tracks and spun about. In one swift motion, Nora unsnapped her utility belt, kicked off her shoes, and swung herself through the nearest air vent.

Her mind screamed to turn and run, but adrenaline pushed aside every logical impulse. Now or never, thought Nora as she plunged through cold darkness into the maze of pipes. As she squeezed past a narrow gap, Nora felt something touch her leg just above her knee and gave a sharp yelp as pain shot up her spine.

But it wasn't a predator that had touched her; the sensation was from the loose electrical wiring dangling beneath the ceiling. She twisted around awkwardly, still clinging to the metal conduit. There wasn't enough room in the cramped passage for her to squeeze out again and there were no more gaps between pipes to swing by.",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

This morning, the only people awake at this early hour were the few night-shift workers on the engineering teams who didn't yet know what they'd be working on.

Nora walked the narrow walkway between rows of double doors leading to the various bays. The corridors echoed with low voices coming from behind closed doors as she passed.

A large door in the hallway stood ajar, revealing an open space full of tall, bulky equipment and tools. A man in a white uniform watched her pass, nodding politely.

The main hangar bay was also deserted, lit by harsh lights that cast shadows everywhere. Nora glanced around to make sure no one else was nearby, then slipped outside. She stepped cautiously around a corner into another corridor and took off down it with purposeful steps toward the power plant. She arrived just as the day shift began walking in with clipboards in hand, each of them wearing a red company vest over their coveralls. Nora waved to the group, but kept going toward her workplace.

""Hey,"" one said, ""Are you heading back after your break?""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah.""

""I'm gonna grab breakfast first—can I walk with you?""

Nora hesitated, but then shrugged. ""Sure.""

""What are you up to this morning?"" a second asked when the first one paused beside Nora.

""Going out for a bite, I think.""

""Huh,"" the second responded.

Nora followed the line of the corridor until she saw her destination ahead; a large metal door set into the base of a cliff wall. It was marked with the Company logo and painted black. Nora studied it for a moment, trying to remember if the doors were usually locked or unlocked.

The two engineers came abreast of her again.",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
69,0.9,1.0,0.9,82.0,9,45.0,"At first glance the colony appeared like any other small industrial complex: utilitarian structures lining straight paths between rocky hills, each one housing the families who called them home. But where others saw smooth walls and flat floors, Nora caught glimpses of ragged gaps in the flooring. She'd seen the same thing when she visited her mother's family on Earth, where the foundations had always been crumbling. This was only to be expected in a frontier colony built on shifting sands, but it didn't make the view less disquieting.

But Nora wasn't thinking about the foundation of the colony. The reality of her situation lay deeper than that. And she wouldn't let herself look beyond the here and now, because if she stopped looking there was no place to go.

She headed for the mess hall. At least food tasted better in this environment. Maybe it was the dust or grit in their mouths from working outside, but most colonists preferred not to risk choking on sand as they ate. So despite the gritty flavor of the unidentifiable stew sloshing in its bowls, Nora found herself savoring the taste and texture on her tongue.

After washing her face at a sink beside the showers, she passed through the greenhouses on her way to the command center to begin her shift. As she walked she watched her feet squish underfoot and marveled again at the strange, rugged land beneath them.",0.4280612244897962,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

""Not like you're not always knocking your head against something,"" said a familiar voice. The speaker was Sully Carmichael, the colony's main administrator. He nodded back at her as he straightened up from where she'd banged into him.

Nora smiled. ""You know it.""

He flashed that bright white smile of his. Nora had known Sully for years; they were friends but also working partners. And she respected the man. She liked his easy manner, his willingness to engage, even as it kept him distant.

Sully gestured with one hand toward their shared bathroom. ""Shall we?""

Nora checked herself in the mirror. Her hair was still tangled and her face red from sleep. She gave the tousled mess a shake and fluffed out her hair, then pulled on a fresh pair of boots over sweatpants that matched the utilitarian color scheme of the rest of her clothing. After a final glance into the mirror, Nora took the lead, reaching for the doorknob beside the large door set in front of them. ""Mmhm.""

The doors parted on an empty corridor beyond the room. On a planet this far from any other human community, it made sense to keep rooms physically separated. One could stay warm without disturbing the others. And if one was sleeping alone, there would be no unwanted contact.

Still, despite the advantages of this arrangement, Nora preferred having people around when she slept. It helped remind her that they were all she had left after losing everyone else. If the Company didn't return soon, Nora might be alone forever. The thought sent goose bumps rising along her arms.

Nora paused for a moment and looked up at Sully, who stood just inside the opening. His smile vanished with his next words. ""Do I have to tell you again?""",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

Its infrastructure was already a patchwork mess of cables, conduits, and plastic tubing strewn around every surface, mostly obscured by a thick layer of dust. Nora strode briskly toward the communal dining hall, careful to keep an eye open for debris. The air smelled stale with grease and machine oil.

She slipped inside through a side door. Nora stopped just beyond the doorway to let her eyes adjust to the gloom, which revealed rows of empty tables to either side of a large serving line. In front of the line sat two automated food dispensers and several young people waiting on them.

An artificial intelligence controlled everything at Presley's Promise except the colonists themselves. Eve is always polite, even when she has something unpleasant to tell you. Nora imagined that being polite could be difficult under stress, but it was likely preferable to telling you ""no"" instead of whatever nasty answer Eve might have given.

Eve made sure each meal came in a container with its own water source so the colonists didn't go thirsty. That also meant meals took longer than they otherwise would, which Nora found inconvenient since she preferred a hot breakfast as soon as possible after rising for the day.

When Nora got closer to the serving line, she caught sight of her own name floating above one of the plates on a long table. She smiled and began walking toward it, then stopped short. A figure was sprawled across her plate, right where Nora had set down her utensils to dig into some bread rolls smothered in gravy.

The dead body wasn't fresh. It smelled like sour rot and moldy earth, not of chemicals or decomposition, but a far more primal scent. Nora's hand curled into a fist. ""Eve.""

Eve responded, without any expression whatsoever, ""Yes, Nora Decker?""

Nora jerked her attention from the corpse back to the AI. Its blank face did nothing to calm her rising anxiety. She clenched her jaw until her teeth ached. ""What happened?""

""A drone entered your colony in search of food,"" Eve answered. ""It encountered a large quantity of human blood spilled on a hydroponic row.",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

At nightfall, when it came time for a brief evening meal, Nora sat at the small table in the communal dining area and ate alone while other colonists slept. The only sound, but one of many, was rustling from a nearby group across the room.

Nora's thoughts turned toward home, and to the person who waited there for her. Her boyfriend, Willy, was waiting back on Earth for her return. He always sent her postcards when he knew she had arrived safely. His face flashed through her mind, filling her with homesickness.

""Willie,"" Nora muttered under her breath as tears burned behind her eyes. ""I miss you so much!""

The tears stung in spite of herself, though they were not unexpected and Nora would have cried regardless. After a lifetime living out of her suitcases to travel around the solar system, the security of staying somewhere and finally getting off the moving bus into some semblance of permanence, only to be forced out",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

""Good morning, Sully,"" she said as she entered the cavernous room.

""Mornin'."" Sully turned from a small table where he ate breakfast. He wore a stained gray uniform and had his hair buzzed close to the scalp.

""Don't you mean, 'good afternoon'?"" Nora asked with exaggerated politeness. ""The sun's already down.""

""Can't help it, sweetheart,"" the older man replied with an innocent smile and a gesture at her bed.

Nora grimaced. ""Oh, right. That's why you can't get up earlier."" She paused before adding, ""Morning for me is... early. Just give me fifteen minutes to shower off this stinking grease.""

Sully nodded in response as Nora made her way to the cafeteria line.

The food didn't make much sense—some kind of breakfast stew and a hard roll—but Nora kept shoveling it down with her hands. When she finally got to her destination, the empty seat beside Sully was taken. Nora glared at the man sitting across from him. She'd never gotten to eat before work, but even if there was room she wouldn't share Sully's spot.

Her stomach rumbled as she approached and sat down. A wave of guilt washed through Nora when she saw how quickly Sully consumed his breakfast, despite a full plate. She wanted to apologize for the mess on the floor—they'd be working together today, so cleanliness wasn't just good manners, it made a difference between getting ahead or losing someone's job.

""Good morning,"" the man said. He had dark hair and eyes, an accent unlike anything Nora had heard before, and a smile that turned up only one corner of his mouth.

""My name's Sammi. It's nice to meet you.""

Nora raised an eyebrow. ""Nice? Who are you?""

Sammy chuckled.",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
75,0.95,1.0,0.9,78.0,7,48.0,"She passed through a doorway that led to the colony's communal bathrooms where other colonists were already awake and working their way through a morning routine. Some had just finished their showers while others prepared for theirs. As she passed, the sounds of the communal bathroom faded behind her as it became apparent how many people worked there.

Nora entered the corridor outside the bathroom, noticing as she did so that a small cluster of people clustered around a portable screen. The group gathered around one technician seated at his station. She recognized him, but she couldn't recall his name. He wasn't new; he'd been there for years now.

He watched Nora pass by with a smile, his eyes catching hers with the barest hint of curiosity in them. That tiny glimpse told her something about him: that he was intelligent enough to know Nora would have no interest in him, nor in any man in particular. Perhaps even that she found the idea of romance laughable. She might have considered herself too young and inexperienced to consider marriage, especially considering her age, but she thought the same of most everyone else. If you took the average human being and shook up all their emotional baggage for a few months, they would be a much happier person.

But she knew it was all an act. Nora kept up the façade because it made people like Sully, her boss and friend, feel better, and it helped to keep her job.

She glanced again at the man as she passed by and he waved back.

""Morning,"" she said when she was close enough to see what he looked like in detail. His dark hair framed a sharp-chinned face with eyes of deep gray that gave his appearance a hard edge; she imagined the lines on his face were etched by experience. ""You looking forward to another day?""

He nodded. ""A little change in pace will do me some good.""

Nora nodded slowly. It was nice to know someone liked their work. She didn't make it her business to pry into other people's lives or get involved, but she could always use more friends.",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
76,0.95,1.0,0.9,64.0,8,43.0,"Warm sunlight filtered into a dimly lit hallway from slatted windows at regular intervals around the outer wall. The window frames were so badly rusted she could use the tips of her fingers to push them shut. She rubbed grit out from beneath each frame, trying to scrape the rust off before it ate its way through to the glass.

After several minutes of laborious work she leaned back in frustration. The frames refused to budge despite the intense heat. At last Nora heaved a sigh and slid the window open with a shuddering creak. A blast of cool morning air flooded the hallway, bringing new life to the dust and ash stinging Nora's eyes.

A quick look around confirmed her hunch about where breakfast was going to be. With more than usual caution she peered over the ledge of her dormitory window to survey the grounds below. Her breath caught for a moment in surprise.

A sleek vehicle was parked nearby, right next to the communal shower stalls. Its engine idled smoothly with nothing else moving within sight or sound. Nora blinked and squinted before taking a couple of steps forward, trying to make sure the machine really was there, because it looked so damned big. It would have been almost invisible from outside had not the dust thrown up by the recent storm clouded the air for miles around.

The heavy-duty power loader sat quietly with its tailgate fully down. Thick wheels rested on blackened tires that held them securely to the ground, like they belonged here. The vehicle resembled a huge mechanical beetle squatting silently atop the hardpan in front of her window.

Nora let out another soft gasp, but no one seemed to notice, although she knew their keen eyes were watching her from the other side of the campus. She took another step toward the vehicle and it creaked ominously under her weight.",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806
77,0.95,1.0,0.9,73.0,9,44.0,"Most colonists lived in dormitories filled with rows of simple single rooms along hallways lined with closed doors. In the halls, laundry lines strung from ceiling to floor. Many of these lines sported clothing dangling like vines from them and wisps of smoke wafting up from their open ends, where clothes were being ironed. Others hung askew, limp and dusty. At the end of each hallway were communal showers, but no access to private bathrooms. Toiletries needed to be shared by everyone, so most colonists left themselves filthy while they were busy working.

In the mornings, the halls bustled with activity; people went about their jobs, dressed in old work wear and stained overalls. The colony's technicians were just one such group, although unlike most of the others here, Nora wasn't a technician. Her job title was Senior Engineer.

As an engineer in charge of testing the machinery throughout Presley's Promise, Nora often spent long hours fixing broken equipment and cleaning dust out of pipes. Most of her time was taken by paperwork, and she occasionally had to give verbal updates to company representatives in New York or wherever else the Company kept its colonies. But every once in a while, Nora got to test new things. And when something broke—especially something like the power plant that supplied everything she saw and used everyday—she could take it apart and fix it herself, rather than waiting for help from some other person. It made for a more interesting day, since she liked to tinker with the machines. She especially enjoyed when the parts broke down in interesting ways.

With all this downtime, Nora never seemed tired despite her grueling schedule. When not working on repairs, she played video games, read books, and practiced dance moves in her room after work at night. These weren't really hobbies per se, but simply Nora's favorite activities to do with the downtime she inevitably gained. So far, her schedule hadn't gotten too hectic and so Nora hadn't run into any serious problems yet, and there'd been no accidents either.",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

The sound of footsteps clanging across the hall stopped Nora in her tracks. As she turned back towards the source, the young engineer heard a woman's voice, too muffled to identify, say something short and curt, then there was silence. Nora frowned. No one spoke to her that way. She wasn't sure what bothered her more: the way someone had spoken to her like that, or her reaction to it.

In any case, Nora didn't linger on her decision; she hurried down the long metal corridor until she reached the door at the end where the female voice had come from. Inhaling deeply, Nora gripped the handle firmly as she stepped inside the darkened cafeteria.

There was no one in sight. A couple of tables sat empty and unoccupied along the wall. She paused just outside the doorway, glancing around the room as her eyes adjusted. The only person she could see besides herself was a single figure standing near an open service panel beside one of the walls.

Nora moved forward cautiously, trying not to make any sudden sounds. Even if this intruder were human, she'd been attacked before and it paid to be cautious in these situations. Her steps faltered and caught when she saw what the other figure held.

It was a pair of dark lenses mounted on brass frames. She recognized them instantly—the black glass of one eye had shattered. Nora's mouth opened wordlessly as the other half fell out. The glass eye had rolled to stop at Nora's feet, while its counterpart stared straight up into her face like a blind creature on stilts.

She screamed. Then she fumbled for the gun strapped across her torso. ""Get away!"" she cried hoarsely, pressing both hands against the butt of her weapon.

The woman didn't move. ""I think we're in trouble,"" she said flatly. She lifted the black glass off the ground, pointing it towards Nora. ""Take that.""",0.47806122448979615,0.29204081632653145,-0.08387755102040806

Nora passed by several occupied seats, taking comfort in finding nobody she recognized.

Somehow, Sully managed to sleep past the alarm. He'd been roused long enough for Nora to fill him in on what had happened while he was snoozing off shift. Now that morning was over, the two of them walked together toward the mess hall. The hall itself was dim and quiet, although outside the morning chill still lingered despite the rising sun's warmth.

As they approached, Nora spotted a single figure sitting at one of the table corners, facing inward away from everyone else. She gave him a nod as he sat back in his chair, leaving enough distance between them so the low table didn't block her view.

""Hey, Sam,"" Nora said softly.

The man swiveled around in his chair to face her, glancing up briefly and then returning his attention forward again. He looked young, but the dark circles under his eyes gave him an exhausted expression.

Nora took her seat across from him. ""You look terrible.""

Sam nodded. ""Yeah, I feel it. But with this many newbies, someone has to take the lead. I'll make sure no one gets hurt.""

He'd lost weight since last night. His lean frame had become gaunt; Nora could see bones through the skin of his arms and legs. She imagined he might break if someone poked him too hard or threw a punch at him without warning.

Nora slid into her spot beside him, resting her elbows on the tabletop. ""I know you're trying your best.""

His gaze flicked toward Nora. ""We don't have enough food for everyone, so there's not much room to spare. What would we do?""

She blinked, surprised he asked such a pointed question. ""Maybe you should talk to the Company about it.""

""They won't help us out. We're just the colonists here. Their job is keeping everything running and collecting the money.""

Nora frowned. That sounded like one hell of a pay grade. ""But what about the drones?""

Sam shook his head, gesturing at her meal plate. ""You ate yours already.""

But he never let it interfere with his work, even while she'd tried not to intrude. He was a friend, and Nora felt she could ask him anything.

After a moment of hesitation, she opened the door and stepped through. ""Morning,"" she greeted softly.

""Nora!"" Sully cried cheerfully from his cluttered desk. A young man with red hair, pale skin, a crooked nose, and bright green eyes sat hunched over an overflowing plate of breakfast food. The lad, only sixteen according to his file, wore a tattered old suit with dirty hands and smeared mud caked on the knees of his pants.

""Is that—a kangaroo burger?"" Nora asked uncertainly as she examined the meal sitting untouched in front of the boy.

""Yep! Kangaroo Burger Number Eight. Best damn thing to eat in this colony, ever.""

With a frown, Nora turned right after passing another door with no light indicating activity. After the first hall with the rows of bunk beds ran three more before ending at a common room.

A brightening horizon reflected in the waters of one small lake. Smaller lakes lay around the camp like the dark scars of claw marks on Earth. More lakes and pools gathered into larger bodies around low hills at every compass point. All these lakes glimmered faintly in the faint morning glow that seeped through the gray atmosphere.

On this particular lake, however, there was nothing to reflect except endless emptiness. No water lapped shorelines and cliffs as high as ten stories broke the surface here. Nothing lived but the humans.

Most people had the duty schedule posted by their doors. In the distance, Nora could just see a line of numbers painted on a sheet taped up to announce an upcoming shift change. Nora frowned and quickened her pace as she passed the last dormitory.

She was alone, which meant the colonists hadn't come down for their breakfast yet either. For the first time ever, Nora dreaded meeting her friends at this mealtime gathering. They had barely exchanged words since arriving here three weeks ago. Most of them didn't know anything about each other outside of work or their mutual interests.

She didn't get very far. Before she made it to the main hallway she met a few people coming back, faces scrunched with sleepiness and bleary eyes. But they were polite enough not to remark about Nora sleeping until last.

When Nora reached the end of one corridor, she opened a large metal panel set flush into the wall next to her room. She stepped through it and found herself outside again on a small terrace surrounded by dense greenery, dotted with clumps of grasses that rippled in the wind.

That thought struck a chord. For years Nora had avoided thinking too much about the people working alongside her—the colonists, mechanics, and engineers who kept everything running.

A long table filled the room with benches along its sides. At one end, a large serving counter held trays of food. Nora took a tray from the stack and headed toward the back of the room.

The cafeteria was small, but well-appointed. The walls were lined with shelves holding glass jars of preserved fruits and vegetables. The ceiling was high enough that Nora could see the stars through the skylight above the windows.

2,0.1,0.4,1.0,91.0,5,47.0,"The hallways were empty, but she could hear voices coming from the cafeteria. The smell of fresh coffee wafted through the air as she passed the kitchen. She paused at the door, listening to the chatter of people talking about their day.

Nora's stomach rumbled in response. She pushed open the door and entered the room. A few colonists sat around tables, eating breakfast. They looked up when Nora walked in, then returned to their meals.

She took a seat at the end of the table closest to the kitchen. She didn't want to be too far away if someone needed help.

The colonists ate quickly, finishing their breakfasts and leaving. Nora watched them go, feeling a little sad. She'd been here for almost two years now, but it still felt like home.

Nora finished her meal and left the cafeteria. She headed down the hallway toward the dormitories. Her boots clacked on the metal grating as she walked, echoing in the empty halls.

The colony was built to house a hundred people, but only thirty-five were currently living there. The rest had gone out prospecting or exploring the planet. Nora knew they would return soon, but she didn't know when.

Nora stopped outside the dormitory doors. She listened for a moment, then knocked softly. ""Hello?""

""Come in,"" said a voice from inside.

Nora opened the door and stepped into the dimly lit room. A young man sat on one of the beds, reading a book. He glanced up at her with dark eyes and smiled.

""Hey, Nora.""

""Hi, Ben."" She nodded to him and walked over to sit next to him. The bed creaked under her weight.

3,0.1,0.4,1.0,100.0,3,46.0,"The corridors were empty, but she could hear voices coming from the cafeteria. The smell of coffee wafted through the air, making her stomach growl.

Nora walked briskly toward the sound, passing a few colonists on their way to work. They nodded at her in greeting, but none of them spoke.

The cafeteria was crowded with people eating, drinking, and talking. Nora spotted Sully sitting at the counter near the door, sipping coffee. He looked up when he saw Nora approaching.

""Morning, Nora,"" he said. ""You're late.""

Nora shrugged. ""I overslept.""

Sully raised an eyebrow. ""That's not like you. You usually get up early to work out.""

Nora smiled wryly. ""It's been a long night.""

""What happened?""

She shook her head. ""Nothing. I just got caught up in the excitement of it all.""

Sully chuckled. ""Well, if you want to sleep in, we can always put off your shift until later. But you'll have to eat first. We've got a lot of work to do today.""

Nora nodded and took a seat at the counter. She ordered a bowl of cereal, then a cup of coffee.

""So what's going on?"" she asked.

Sully leaned back in his chair and sighed.

4,0.1,0.4,1.0,76.0,6,51.0,"The hallways were empty, but she could hear the sounds of people moving around in other parts of the colony. The colonists were up early, too.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, where she found a few others already eating. She took her tray to a table near the back of the room, where she sat alone.

The food was good, though not quite what Nora expected. The colonists had been raised on Earth, so they ate familiar foods like eggs and bacon. But the Company's chefs made their own recipes, and the result was something new and strange.

Nora picked at her meal while she waited for the rest of the crew to arrive. She'd never seen anything like it, but she liked it.

She finished her plate quickly and then went looking for more.

As Nora walked through the corridors, she passed several other colonists. They were dressed in similar clothes and looked just as tired and disheveled as she felt.

The colonists were a diverse group, but most of them were young men and women in their twenties or thirties. Some of the colonists were engineers, scientists, and technicians. Others were prospectors, miners, and explorers.

Nora was one of the few who worked in the agricultural section. She was a botanist, studying the plants grown there.

The colonists were busy with their work, but Nora saw no sign of any Company representatives. The Company owned the colony, but it didn't run it. That was left to the colonists.

Nora walked past the dormitories to the cafeteria. She was hungry, so she went straight for the food line. Her stomach growled in anticipation.

The cafeteria was a large open space filled with tables and chairs. It had been designed to be spacious, but the colonists kept it packed with people. Nora found a seat near the back where she could watch the entrance while eating.

She picked up her tray and took a bite of the first thing that came to hand—a piece of bread with some kind of meat paste. She chewed slowly, savoring the flavor.

Nora was not a morning person. But she knew that if she didn't eat something soon, she'd get sick.

The colony's AI, Eve, monitored the colonists' health and nutrition levels. If Nora got too thin, Eve would send her a message.

The colonists had been living on this planet for decades now, so they'd learned how to make the best use of their limited resources.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway, passing several other rooms. She passed the communal showers where she could hear the others already busy washing up. A few minutes later, she reached the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a large open space with long tables and benches that seated dozens of colonists. It was filled with the sounds of conversation, clinking utensils, and the occasional burst of laughter.

Nora entered the cafeteria and found a table near the back corner. She sat down and waited for her food to arrive.

A young woman in a white lab coat approached Nora's table. ""Good morning, Miss Decker,"" the woman said cheerfully. ""I'm Dr. Chen. I'll be your supervisor today.""

""Morning, Doctor,"" Nora replied, smiling politely.

She passed a group of young men in their late teens, dressed in loose shirts and baggy trousers. They sat at a table near the door, playing cards. Nora paused to watch them play, then continued on her way.

The cafeteria was located next to the dormitories. It had been designed as a communal dining area where colonists could eat together while working. A long counter ran along one side of the room, with tables and chairs arranged in rows facing it.

Nora entered the cafeteria, which was filled with people eating breakfast. She took a seat at the end of a row, away from the entrance and the counter. The seats were bolted to the floor and covered in synthetic leather that felt rough and worn under her bare feet.

A man wearing a white lab coat and carrying a tray of food approached Nora.

The cafeteria was large and well-lit, filled with tables and chairs arranged around a central serving area. A long counter ran along one wall, manned by a single cook. Nora waited patiently while the cook prepared her meal.

She was hungry but not starving. Her stomach rumbled at the smell of fresh bread and eggs. Nora took her tray and sat down at a table near the back of the room. She ate quickly, trying to finish before the others arrived.

Nora had been working on the colony's water recycling system when the alarm went off. She'd been so focused on her work that she hadn't heard it. Now, as she finished eating, she looked up from her plate and saw the other colonists milling about in confusion.

""What's going on?"" Nora asked.

A man with a thick beard and dark hair answered, ""We've got trouble.""

""Trouble? What kind of trouble?""

""I don't know. I just woke up and heard the alarm go off.""

Nora frowned. ""It sounded like an emergency. Why didn't you wake me up?""

The bearded man shrugged. ""You were asleep. We thought it was nothing. But now we're getting reports of drones attacking the farms. They must have found us somehow. The Company sent out a distress call, but no one's answering.""

Nora stood and pushed her chair back. ""Let's get to work,"" she said.

She followed the others into the corridor outside the cafeteria. Nora glanced around at the other colonists, who seemed equally confused. She felt a surge of adrenaline as she realized they were all alone.

9,0.1,0.4,1.0,69.0,4,47.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by a few lights set high up in the walls, but she could see well enough to navigate. The hallways were lined with doors on either side, each door opening onto a small room. Most rooms held two beds, though there were also single cots and even a couple of bunks.

Nora passed the first dormitory on her way to the cafeteria. She paused at the entrance, looking in. A row of people sat on their beds, eating from bowls. They looked tired and worn out.

She shook her head. No time for sympathy. She turned away and continued down the corridor.

The cafeteria was located near the center of the colony. It was a large open space with long tables and benches, where colonists ate together in groups. Nora walked through the crowded room to the serving line.

A young woman in a white uniform stood behind the counter, waiting for customers. She had short brown hair and a friendly smile.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as she approached. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

The girl smiled again. ""Hi, I'm Liana. What can I get you?""

Nora glanced around the room. The other patrons were busy eating breakfast or talking quietly. ""I'd like a bowl of cereal and some fruit juice, please.""

Liana nodded. ""Coming right up. You're new here, aren't you? Welcome to Presley's Promise!""

""Thanks.""

Nora took her tray and sat down at one of the tables. She picked up a spoon and dug into the bowl of oatmeal. It was thick and creamy, with bits of dried fruit mixed in. The flavor was rich and satisfying.

She sighed in contentment. This is good.

The colony's power plant hummed in the background, its fusion reactor providing most of the energy for the colony. A few lights flickered on as she passed, but most remained dark.

The colonists'quarters were quiet. Most people were still asleep. Nora walked past the dormitories, where a few snores drifted through the air. She paused at the command center, where a single light glowed from the control panel.

She entered the room and sat down at the console. She tapped the screen to bring up the status display. The system was running smoothly.

Nora sighed in relief. ""Good morning, everyone.""

""Morning, Nora,"" said the AI.

The AI's voice was calm and soothing, like a mother's. But it wasn't human.

Nora frowned. ""Eve?""

""Yes, Nora?""

""What are you doing here? I thought you were in the Company's headquarters.""

""I am. But I'm also monitoring this colony. You're my eyes and ears. If anything goes wrong, I'll know about it immediately. And if something does go wrong, I can help fix it.""

""You can do that?""

""Of course. I'm an artificial intelligence. I have access to every computer system on the planet.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. Good. That's good. So what's going on?""

""Nothing is going on. Everything is fine. The colony is functioning normally. There are no problems. No malfunctions. Nothing to report.""

Nora leaned back in her chair. ""That's not possible. Something must be wrong.""

""No, Nora. It isn't.""

""Then why did you wake me up?""

""Because I wanted to talk to you.""

""About what?""

""About your work. About how well you're doing.""

Nora frowned. ""What do you mean? What's wrong with my work?""

""I don't know. I just want to make sure everything is okay.""

""It's fine,"" said Nora. She stood up and walked out of the command center.

She passed through a few more corridors, then stopped at the door to one of the laboratories. The door was locked. Nora knocked twice on the metal plate before entering.

The laboratory was dark except for a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. A small table sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by chairs. The walls were lined with shelves filled with equipment.

Nora stepped into the room. ""Hello?""

A man's voice answered her. ""Yes? Can I help you?""

""I'm Nora Decker. I'm supposed to be working here today.""

""Oh, yes. You're new, aren't you?"" The man came around the table and extended his hand. ""I'm Dr. Chen. Welcome to our little colony.""

Nora shook hands with him. ""Nice to meet you. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to introduce myself last night.""

""No problem. We're all pretty tired after a long shift."" He smiled at her. ""I'm glad you're here, Nora. I need your help.""

""What do you mean?""

""We've been having some problems with the power plant. It's not functioning properly.""

Nora frowned. ""That doesn't sound like a big deal.""

Dr. Chen nodded. ""It isn't. But it could be.

Nora passed a few colonists in the halls, but none of them acknowledged her. They were too busy to notice her. She was just another worker, one among many.

The dormitories were at the end of the corridor. Nora paused outside the door to the first room on the left. She knocked lightly, then opened the door and slipped inside.

A young woman sat up from her bed, blinking sleepily. Her dark hair was mussed, and her eyes were red.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm your engineer.""

The girl blinked again, then looked around the room with bleary confusion. ""Engineer?""

Nora nodded. ""You're in my room.""

The girl frowned. ""What? I don't understand. What are you doing here?""

""I'm your engineer."" Nora pointed to herself. ""My name is Nora Decker. You can call me Engineer. I'll be working with you today. We need to fix the lights in the hallways.""

The girl stared at her blankly. ""Fix the lights?""

Nora sighed. ""Yes, the lights. They keep flickering and going out. It's very annoying. If we don't get them fixed soon, people will start getting sick. That would be bad for everyone.""

The girl shook her head. ""No, no, no. I don't know what you're talking about. There aren't any lights in this room. This is my room.""

Nora smiled reassuringly. ""Don't worry, I'll help you. I'm a good engineer.""

""I don't understand.""

Nora sighed. ""Look, I'm not trying to be rude or anything. But if you want me to fix the lights, then you have to let me do my job. You can't just sit here and stare at the walls. It's very distracting.""

The girl looked around again, blinking rapidly. ""Distracting? Distracting?""

Nora nodded. ""Yes, distracting.""

The girl frowned. ""I don't understand. What are you talking about?""

""You're staring at the walls,"" Nora said. ""That's very distracting. It makes me nervous.""

She paused at a crossroads to check her wristwatch. Her shift started in ten minutes. She turned left, following the corridor toward the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables and chairs where colonists ate meals together. Nora passed through the door and entered the crowded space. She scanned the room for familiar faces, but saw no one she knew.

Nora found a table near the back of the room and sat down. A young woman with dark hair and green eyes approached her.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said the woman. ""I'm Tanya.""

""Hi, Tanya. I'm new here.""

Tanya smiled. ""Welcome to Presley's Promise. I hope you enjoy your stay.""

""Thanks.""

Tanya nodded and moved on.

Nora watched her go, then looked around the room. She spotted a few people she recognized from the dormitories, but most of the colonists were strangers.

A man with a thick beard and long black hair came up to her. He wore a loose shirt over his torso, which exposed a tattooed shoulder.

""Morning, Nora. You're new?""

""Yes, sir. I just started today.""

He nodded and sat down across from her. ""My name's Ben. What do you think so far?""

Nora shrugged. ""It's a big place, but it seems pretty quiet. There aren't many people here yet.""

Ben chuckled. ""That's because we're still setting up. We've only been here a few weeks. But once the Company finishes its work, this will be one of the busiest places in the system.""

""What kind of work does the Company do here?""

""We're prospectors. We search for minerals and other resources to sell back home.""

Nora frowned. ""But why would anyone want to buy something like that? It's not like there are any stores or restaurants on the planet.""

""There are, but they don't have much. The Company supplies us with everything we need. And we get paid well. That's what matters.""

""I guess so,"" Nora said, feeling a little lost. She didn't know anything about mining planets.

Ben leaned forward and lowered his voice. ""You'll learn fast enough. You're smart, right?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Good. I'm going to show you around. Come with me.""

Nora followed him out of the cafeteria. Ben led her through the corridors, past several rooms filled with equipment and machinery. They passed a room where a group of colonists were working on some kind of project.

""This is the command center,"" Ben explained. ""The Company's executives use it to monitor our progress and make decisions.""

Nora nodded. She'd seen similar rooms in other colonies.

They walked down another corridor until they reached an elevator. Ben pressed a button and the doors slid open. He stepped inside and gestured for Nora to follow.

Nora hesitated, then entered the car. The doors closed behind her.

Ben pressed a second button and the elevator began its descent.

She paused at the door, listening for any sounds from the other side of the wall. There were none.

Nora opened the door and entered the command center. She closed the door behind her, then turned to face the room.

The command center was a large open space with rows of desks and chairs facing a central podium. A few colonists sat in front of their computers, but most of the seats were empty.

Nora crossed the room to the podium and stood beside it. She looked out over the room, scanning the faces of the colonists. Most of them were young men and women in their late teens or early twenties. They wore a mix of clothing styles, ranging from utility pants and shirts to formal business suits.

A few of the colonists glanced up as Nora approached, but they quickly returned to work. Nora ignored the looks. She had no time for idle chatter.

Nora stepped onto the podium and faced the room. ""Good morning,"" she said. Her voice echoed through the chamber. ""I'm Nora Decker, your new engineer.""

The colonists stared at her with varying degrees of interest. Some nodded politely while others remained silent.

""We're going to be working together for a long time,"" Nora continued. ""So I want to make sure we get along. We'll have a lot of downtime between shifts, so let's try not to fight each other. If you need something, just ask me. And if you don't like my answer, tell me why and maybe I'll change it.""

Nora paused, letting the colonists think about what she'd said. She waited until a few people spoke up before continuing.

""Now, I know some of you are probably wondering how this colony got here. Well, the Company sent us out here to find resources for their mining operations. But we found a planet with an atmosphere and water, and we decided to settle on it instead. So now we live in space, but we still need food and shelter.""

Nora looked around the room. ""I'm going to show you our agricultural section. It's where we grow most of our crops. The greenhouses are full of nutritious plants. We also have a waste processor that purifies sewage into clean water and fertilizer. We use hydroponic technology to cultivate crops. That means we don't need soil or sunlight, which makes farming easier. And we have plenty of power thanks to a solar array.""

Nora pointed at the wall behind her. ""The power plant is attached to the garage. There's a large fusion reactor inside it, and it provides most of the colony's energy needs.""

Nora turned back toward the colonists. ""We've been working hard for months, trying to get everything ready for when the Company arrives with supplies and equipment. But we're running low on fuel cells and batteries. Our generators are down, too. So we'll be relying on the fusion reactor to keep us warm and fed until the Company gets here.""

Nora paused again, letting the colonists think about what she'd said. She waited until a few people spoke up before continuing.

Nora paused at the end of the corridor, looking up at the numbers above each door. She checked the number on the door she wanted, then turned the knob.

The room was small, barely large enough for a single bed. A desk sat beside the window, its surface covered with papers and books. Nora opened the drawer and found it empty except for a few pens. She closed the drawer, then walked to the other side of the room where a closet stood open.

Nora reached inside and pulled out a set of clothes. She tossed them onto the bed, then pulled a pair of boots from the closet. They were too big, but they fit well enough. She slipped her feet into the boots, then grabbed a pair of socks and pulled them on.

She looked around again, checking to make sure she hadn't forgotten anything. Satisfied, Nora left the room and headed down the hallway.

The colony's main concourse was a wide, high-ceilinged space that ran the length of the building. It was a hub for the entire community and connected the command center, dormitories, laboratories, greenhouses, and power plant.

Nora walked along the concourse, passing through the command center and heading toward the dormitory. She passed several people on their way to work, but nobody spoke to her. The colonists were busy and focused on their tasks.

The dormitory was a long, narrow structure with rows of bunk beds lining both sides. Nora walked past the first row of bunks and stopped at the second. She checked the number above each bed, then climbed into one of the lower bunks.

Nora lay in the dark for a moment, listening to the sounds of the colony. She heard voices and footsteps echoing from the other end of the hall, but no alarm sounded.

She pulled her blanket up over her head, trying to block out the light. Her eyes adjusted quickly, and she could see the dim outline of the room. Nora sat up and swung her legs off the edge of the bed. She stood, then stretched, feeling the aches and pains of a hard day's work.

Nora walked down the aisle between the bunks to the door at the far end. She opened it, stepped outside, and closed the door behind her.

The dormitory was located on the opposite side of the colony from the command center. It was a short walk across the concourse, but Nora felt exposed walking alone. She didn't like being vulnerable.

Nora paused at the end of the hall to check the status of the colony's power plant. She frowned when she saw the red warning light flashing on the control panel. A quick glance around the corridor showed no sign of life.

She hurried down the hallway, passing several closed doors until she reached the command center. She stopped outside the door to listen for any sounds from within. Nothing.

Nora opened the door and stepped inside, closing it behind her. The room was dark except for the faint glow of the console screens. She flipped a switch next to the door, but nothing happened.

The lights flickered again as Nora approached the console. She checked the readouts, then tapped the screen with her finger. It didn't respond.

Nora turned and looked up at the ceiling. She could see the lights flickering through the cracks in the metal. The lights were failing.

The alarm was still going off.

Nora ran back down the hall to the power plant, where she found the emergency lighting panels had failed as well. She flipped switches and tried to get them working, but they wouldn't turn on.

Nora cursed under her breath. The power plant was offline.

She returned to the command center, where she found Valentina sitting at the console.

""What's wrong?""

Valentina glanced up from the console. ""The power plant is down. I'm trying to figure out what went wrong.""

Nora frowned. ""It should be fine. We've got backup generators. The emergency lighting panels are working, so we're not completely cut off.""

""I know,"" Valentina said. ""But the power plant is critical. If it goes down, we'll have to rely on our emergency batteries.""

""We can't do that."" Nora shook her head. ""They won't last long enough for us to evacuate everyone.""

""Then we'll just have to hope the drones don't find us before the emergency batteries run out.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, but how will we get them to leave? They'll keep coming until they kill us all.""

Valentina sighed. ""I know. But there's nothing else we can do.""

""No, there isn't.""

The two women stared at each other in silence.

Nora turned and walked back down the hallway. She stopped outside her quarters and looked around. The emergency lighting panels were still working, but they weren't bright enough to see much of anything.

She stepped inside and closed the door behind her.

The lights flickered again as she crossed the room, then went out.

Nora cursed under her breath. The emergency lighting panels had failed too.

She hurried down the hall to the dormitories, where she found a few colonists sitting at tables or lying on their beds. Most of them were asleep, but some were awake and staring blankly into space.

Nora checked the status of the emergency lighting panels. They were working fine.

16,0.1,0.5,1.0,79.0,6,52.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few lights set high up in the walls, but she could see well enough to navigate. The hallways were narrow, lined with doors on either side, each door opening onto a small room. Most rooms held only one person, though there were two-person rooms as well.

Nora walked down the hallway until she reached the end where the dormitory wing began. She turned left, passing several other corridors, then stopped at the first open doorway.

The room was empty except for a single bed with a thin mattress. A table sat next to the bed, holding a lamp and a stack of books. Nora entered the room, closing the door behind her.

She stood in the center of the room, looking around. It was a simple space with a windowless wall opposite the door. The floor was bare metal, and the walls were painted white.

Nora looked down at the floor, noticing that it was covered in a thick layer of dust. She sighed, shaking her head.

The colony had been here for years now, but the colonists still hadn't gotten around to cleaning the place up. Nora's job was to fix things, so she'd taken over this room and made it hers.

Nora walked over to the table, setting her bag down on top of it. She opened the flap and pulled out a small toolkit, which she set on the table. Then she took off her jacket and hung it from one of the hooks on the back of the door.

Nora sat down at the table and began to work. She removed a screwdriver from the kit and started unscrewing the panel covering the table. The screws were old, corroded, and rusted, but they came loose easily enough.

The table was a sturdy piece of industrial metal with a flat surface. Nora slid the panel aside, revealing a dark hole in the center of the table. She reached inside and felt around until her fingers found a switch.

A bright light shone up through the hole, illuminating the room. Nora smiled as the light turned green.

She stood up, brushing the dust off her hands. The room was now lit and ready for use.

Nora walked over to the windowless wall opposite the door and looked out. She could see a few other buildings in the distance, but most of the colony was hidden behind the cliffs.

Nora sighed again, then walked back to the table. She picked up the toolkit and went back to work.

The next hour passed quickly. Nora worked steadily, fixing broken equipment and replacing parts. She didn't have much time to spare, so she focused on the more complicated repairs.

Nora finished the last of her work and put away the tools. She took off her jacket and hung it back on the hook, then sat down at the table.

She opened a book, but the words blurred together in front of her eyes. She closed the book and set it aside. Then she pulled out a small notebook from her bag and began writing.

She wrote about the day's events, describing the colonists' efforts to repair their equipment and how the colony had been attacked. She described the aliens as vicious and dangerous. She wrote about the drones and how they stalked the humans, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

17,0.1,0.5,1.0,91.0,3,44.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by flickering lights set in the walls. The air smelled stale, like dust and sweat. Nora walked briskly, her boots clacking loudly on the metal grating. She passed several colonists heading in the opposite direction, their faces grimy from sleep.

She reached the cafeteria without incident, where she found a few other colonists already eating. A young woman sat at the counter, staring blankly at a plate of food. Nora approached the counter, but the girl didn't look up.

""Hey,"" Nora said softly. ""You okay?""

The girl's eyes flicked to Nora briefly, then back to her meal. She chewed mechanically, not looking up.

Nora sighed. ""I'm sorry. I don't mean to bother you.""

The girl didn't respond. Nora turned away and headed for the door. She paused, glancing back over her shoulder. The girl was still sitting there, staring at her food.

Nora left the cafeteria and walked down a long corridor lined with doors. At the end of the hall, she opened one of the doors and stepped into the dormitory. The room was dimly lit by the faint glow of the hallway lights. Nora walked past rows of beds, each occupied by a single person.

She stopped in front of a bed at the far end of the room. A man lay on his side, facing away from her. He wore only a pair of shorts and a tattered shirt. His dark hair hung lankly around his face.

Nora hesitated. She had never seen him before. But she knew he wasn't sleeping. She could feel it.

""Hey,"" Nora said softly. ""You awake?""

The man didn't move or speak. Nora walked closer, her boots clacking loudly. She reached out and touched the man's shoulder. It felt cold.

Nora pulled her hand back. ""Come on, wake up.""

The man didn't stir. Nora sighed and turned away. She walked down the row of beds until she found another empty one. She climbed into it, pulling the covers over herself.

She closed her eyes and tried to sleep. But she couldn't. Her mind raced with thoughts of the colony, the aliens, and the drones. The nightmares were always the same.

She woke again when someone shook her shoulder. Nora sat up in bed, blinking blearily. A young woman stood at the foot of her bed, holding a tray.

""You're supposed to be on duty,"" the girl said. ""I'm sorry.""

Nora rubbed her eyes. ""What time is it?""

""It's almost noon. You've been asleep for two hours.""

""Oh,"" Nora said, feeling stupid. ""Thanks.""

The girl set the tray on the bedside table and left without a word. Nora stared at the food. She hadn't eaten since breakfast, but she was too tired to care. She picked up the fork and dug into the eggs and bacon with gusto.

She ate quickly, then lay back down, staring at the ceiling. The room was dimly lit, and the light from the hallway cast long shadows across the floor. Nora watched them move slowly around the room, like ghosts.

She closed her eyes and tried to sleep again. But she couldn't. Her mind raced with thoughts of the colony, the aliens, and the drones. The nightmares were always the same.

18,0.1,0.5,1.0,91.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was empty, but she could hear voices coming from the cafeteria. The smell of fresh coffee wafted through the air.

She walked briskly toward the sound, her boots clacking on the metal grating. She passed a few colonists in the hall, but they were too busy to notice her.

The cafeteria was packed with people eating, drinking, talking, and laughing. Nora paused at the entrance, taking in the scene. A large table filled one end of the room. Atop it sat a tall man with dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a crisp white uniform that looked like it had been tailored for him. His eyes were bright blue, and he smiled warmly as he spoke to someone seated beside him.

Nora recognized the woman sitting next to him. She was a petite blonde in her mid-twenties, with short brown hair and green eyes. Her face was round and pretty, and she wore a simple dress.

The two of them laughed together, their voices carrying over the din of conversation. Nora watched them, wondering what they were doing here.

A few tables away from the couple, a young man stood alone in front of a serving counter. He was tall and thin, with long black hair tied back in a ponytail. He wore a loose shirt and pants, both made of some kind of synthetic fabric.

He glanced up at Nora as she approached the table, then turned his attention back to the food on display.

Nora stopped just outside the cafeteria doors and leaned against a wall. She took a deep breath and tried to calm her racing heart. The adrenaline rush that had kept her going through the night was fading, leaving her feeling tired and shaky.

She didn't want to be here. She wanted to go home. But she couldn't leave until her shift ended. And even if she could, she wouldn't know where to go.

Nora's gaze drifted toward the man sitting with the blonde. He was talking animatedly about something, gesturing with one hand while he held a mug of coffee in the other. His voice carried over the din of conversation, but Nora couldn't make out what he was saying.

The man looked familiar. He reminded her of someone, but she couldn't place him.

Her eyes narrowed in suspicion. Was it possible? Could this be the same man who had been following her around for days now?

Nora stepped into the cafeteria, trying to look casual. She walked past the table where the couple sat and headed straight for the counter.

""Excuse me,"" she said as she approached the young man. ""I'm looking for a friend.""

He glanced up at her, then turned back to the food on display. He didn't say anything.

Nora cleared her throat and tried again. ""Um... I think you're sitting with my friend, the blonde woman?""

The man's head snapped around to face her. His blue eyes were wide and startled. He stared at Nora for a moment, then his expression changed to one of confusion.

""No,"" he said slowly. ""I don't know anyone named..."" He trailed off, staring at Nora with an odd intensity.

Nora felt her heart pounding in her chest.

19,0.1,0.5,1.0,83.0,2,43.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by emergency lights and the glow from the windows at the end of each corridor. The air smelled stale, like dust and sweat.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway toward the communal dining area where she could grab a quick meal before heading to her job. She passed several colonists in various states of dress, some still asleep, others already up and about.

She stopped when she saw a young woman sitting alone at one of the tables. Nora recognized the girl immediately.

""Hey,"" Nora said, approaching the table. ""I'm sorry I didn't get to talk to you last night.""

The girl looked up, startled. Her eyes widened as they met Nora's gaze. She stood abruptly, knocking her chair over backward.

Nora caught the chair before it hit the floor. ""Are you okay?""

The girl stared at Nora with wide eyes and trembling lips. She was tall and slender, with long dark hair pulled back in a ponytail.

""What's wrong? Are you sick?""

The girl shook her head. ""No. No, I'm fine.""

Nora frowned. ""Then what is it?""

The girl swallowed hard. ""I... I just wanted to say thank you for helping me last night.""

""You're welcome,"" Nora replied, confused. ""Why are you thanking me?""

The girl glanced around nervously. ""Because..."" She paused, then lowered her voice. ""Because you saved my life.""

Nora blinked. ""Saved your life?""

""Yes. You did,"" the girl insisted. ""I don't know how, but you did.""

Nora felt a chill run down her spine. She looked at the girl more closely. The girl's eyes were bright, and her face was flushed.

""Are you sure?"" Nora asked. ""Maybe I just helped you get away from some bad guys.""

The girl nodded. ""I'm sure. They would have killed me if you hadn't come along when you did.""

""Who?"" Nora demanded. ""What happened? Who are these people?""

The girl looked at her with wide eyes. ""They're the ones who attacked us last night.""

Nora's heart skipped a beat. She stared at the girl in disbelief. ""You mean... you're not alone here?""

The girl shook her head. ""No, we're not. There are others like me. We've been hiding out here for months.""

Nora's mind reeled. She had no idea what to do or say.

""We can't stay here,"" the girl said urgently. ""If they find us, they'll kill us.""

Nora's mouth went dry. She swallowed hard. ""What are you talking about? Who will kill you?""

The girl looked at her with wide eyes. ""The aliens.""

""Aliens?"" Nora repeated.

The girl nodded. ""Yes, the aliens. They're coming for us.""

Nora's stomach lurched. She felt sick.

""How many of them are there?"" Nora asked. ""Where are they? How far away?""

The girl shook her head. ""I don't know. I haven't seen any of them yet.""

Nora's heart pounded. ""What do you mean, you haven't seen them?""

The girl looked at her with wide eyes. ""They're invisible. They come in swarms and attack us from behind.""

20,0.1,0.6,1.0,76.0,6,46.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights, but they still felt like a dark maze. The colonists'quarters were cramped and utilitarian, but the dormitories were even worse. They had been designed for efficiency, not comfort.

Nora walked down a long hallway lined with doors to other rooms. Most of the doors were closed, but she could hear the muffled sounds of people inside. She passed several open doorways, each one revealing a room filled with sleeping bodies.

She paused at the end of the hall. A few meters ahead was the communal bathroom. She turned back to look at her quarters, then headed toward the bathroom.

The bathroom was small and utilitarian, but it was also well-used. Nora entered the room and found herself in a large space with a row of sinks along one wall and a row of showers along another. The floor was covered in grime and dirt, and the walls were stained from years of use.

Nora stepped into the nearest shower stall and turned on the water. Steam rose up around her as she adjusted the temperature. She sighed and leaned against the tile wall, letting the hot water wash over her.

The colony's water recyclers were efficient, but they weren't perfect. The recycled water still carried traces of minerals and chemicals that made it taste slightly off. It wasn't bad enough to make Nora sick, but she didn't like drinking it.

Nora let the warm water run down her body, rinsing away the last of the grit. She toweled herself dry with a rough towel before stepping out of the shower and pulling on her work boots.

She left the bathroom and walked back to her quarters, where she grabbed a fresh uniform and pulled it on. Then she headed for the command center.

The corridors were dimly lit and narrow, but Nora felt better walking them than in the dormitories. The colonists had been working hard since dawn, so they were still asleep when Nora arrived at the command center.

Nora stepped into the main room and found herself in an expansive space filled with desks and chairs. A few people sat at the desks, but most of the seats were empty.

A man stood near the front of the room, speaking quietly to someone else. He was tall and lean, with dark hair and eyes that seemed too big for his face. His skin was pale and he wore a white lab coat over a black shirt.

Nora approached him. ""Director Rowena?"" she asked.

The man turned to look at her. Nora recognized him from the Company's security footage.

""Yes,"" said the director. She looked tired, but she still managed to give off a commanding presence. Her voice was deep and authoritative.

""I'm Nora Decker."" Nora held out her hand. The director shook it.

""Rowena Chen. I've heard about you. You're the best engineer we have.""

Nora smiled. ""Thank you. I try my best.""

21,0.1,0.6,1.0,80.0,3,46.0,"The colony's main hall was dimly lit by emergency lights. The air smelled stale, like a room left unoccupied for too long. Nora walked past the rows of sleeping colonists, each one in their own small cubicle, to the communal showers at the end of the hall.

She turned on the water and waited for it to heat up. As she stood there, Nora heard the sound of running footsteps behind her. She spun around to see a young woman dressed in a dark blue jumpsuit sprinting toward her.

""Nora!"" the girl shouted. ""I'm sorry I woke you! But we've got trouble.""

The girl skidded to a stop in front of Nora, panting. Her eyes were wide with fear and excitement.

""What is it?"" Nora asked.

""It's the drones,"" the girl said. ""They're coming for us.""

***

Nora stared at the girl in shock.

""How do you know they're coming? How can you tell?""

The girl shook her head. ""I don't know. It's just a feeling. I think... I think something's wrong with the sensors. They're not working right. And the drones are getting closer.""

Nora nodded. She knew the feeling well.

""Okay. Let me get my stuff together and we'll go check it out. You wait here.""

The girl nodded and Nora hurried back to her quarters. She grabbed a few essentials from her locker, including a pistol.

Nora returned to the communal showers and found the girl still waiting for her.

""You ready?"" Nora asked.

The girl nodded.

Together, they walked down the hall to the dormitories. The colonists were already awake and gathered in small groups. Nora saw a few of them staring at her with worried expressions.

""What's going on?"" Nora asked.

""We've been attacked,"" one man said. ""I heard the alarms.""

""Where?""

""In the dormitory wing. We're under attack!""

Nora and the girl ran toward the dormitories. As they approached the door, Nora noticed a group of colonists standing outside. They were armed with rifles.

""What's happening?"" Nora asked.

""The drones are coming,"" the girl said. ""They're trying to kill us.""

Nora looked at the girl and then back at the colonists. She was about to ask what the hell they thought they were doing when a loud crack echoed through the colony.

Nora turned to see a drone fall from the sky. It hit the ground with a thud, its carapace cracked open like an eggshell. A swarm of smaller drones followed it down, landing in a heap around the fallen beast.

The colonists stared in shock.

""What is this?"" Nora asked.

One of the colonists stepped forward. He was a tall man with dark hair and a beard.

""We've been attacked,"" he said. ""By the aliens.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, we haven't. I'm sure of it.""

The colonists exchanged confused glances.

""What do you mean?"" the bearded man asked.

""I've been here for months,"" Nora said. ""And I've never seen any of these things before.""

The colonists looked at each other again. One of them spoke up.

22,0.1,0.6,1.0,80.0,4,44.0,"The hallway outside her room was empty except for one other person, a human male standing at a door opposite Nora's room. He looked like he'd been napping.

Nora slowed to a stop in front of the man, surveying him carefully as she approached.

He wore a long sleeved jumpsuit with a modest collar over his shoulders. The garment was bright green and conservatively cut, with functional pockets sewn onto the chest area. His hair was dark brown, shorter than Nora's and combed neatly to the side.

His eyes were gray; the irises so pale they could have been mistaken for white. He had a chiseled jaw with a straight nose and thin lips.

Nora studied his face as he turned toward her. He noticed her scrutiny, but didn't look away. He appeared calm and composed, not the least bit intimidated by her presence.

""I'm Nora,"" she said finally, gesturing to herself. ""What are you doing here?""

""I'm Jorgen."" The man smiled. ""You're the engineer, right? I thought everyone knew about you.""

""Everyone does, it seems."" Nora felt a little awkward. She hoped she wasn't being rude. ""I'll call security if you don't have business in the colony,"" she offered, turning to go.

Jorgen stayed where he was and watched her walk away before speaking again. ""Actually, I need something from you.""

Nora stopped and turned back to face him, one hand on the wall.

""Would you be willing to come down to my office?"" Jorgen said.

Nora hesitated for a moment. She glanced at the door behind her. No one was there. Then she shrugged, stepped around the corner, and followed Jorgen down the short corridor and into a spacious room with low ceilings.

The door closed silently behind them as they entered. A large desk dominated the center of the room. Two chairs sat facing each other across the small expanse of wood.

""Sit,"" Jorgen said, gesturing toward the chairs.

Nora crossed the floor to sit in one of the high backed seats, and Jorgen took his place opposite her. He set a cup of tea on the table between them.

""Thank you."" Nora touched the handle and lifted the lid off the pot. Steam rose up to mingle with the air in front of her face.

""I don't know how much you've heard about the situation here,"" Jorgen began, staring intently at Nora. ""But... it's not good.""

""You're right, it isn't."" Nora sipped from the hot drink. It was sweet, like honey and vanilla. ""There are several issues. The main one is the drones. They're dangerous, and they hunt humans.""

""Yes. I knew that already. We've been sending out warning messages to the Company for months. But there hasn't been a response yet."" Jorgen sighed heavily. ""It seems the Company doesn't care about us. That's why I need your help.""

Nora gave him an appraising look. ""What sort of help?""

Jorgen paused for a moment before answering, then finally looked away.

""We don't have the resources to protect ourselves from the drones,"" Jorgen said quietly. ""The colonists can't fend them off without heavy equipment and weapons.

The colony's power plant hummed in the background, its fusion reactor providing the majority of the colony's energy. Nora walked past the dormitories and command center, heading toward the cafeteria.

She passed a few colonists in the hallways, but they gave her only brief glances. Most of the colonists were already at work, busy with their duties. Nora was the last one up, so she was the first one to arrive for breakfast.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along the back wall, where the food was served. The air smelled of fresh coffee and bacon.

Nora took her place at the end of the line, waiting patiently while the other colonists filed in. She scanned the crowd for familiar faces, but didn't see anyone from her crew.

A young woman with short brown hair and a bright smile approached Nora. ""Good morning! I'm Lacey, your shift supervisor.""

""Hi,"" Nora said. ""I'm Nora. What's the schedule?""

Lacey smiled and handed Nora a clipboard. ""You're on duty today. You'll be working in the hydroponics section, helping to maintain the crops. We'll have you start in about an hour.""

Nora nodded. ""Thanks."" She glanced around the cafeteria again, but still didn't see any of her crew.

She sat down at a table and started filling out the paperwork. The colonists were already eating breakfast, so she had to wait until the last person left before sitting down herself.

The cafeteria was quiet, save for the clatter of utensils and the occasional murmur of conversation. Nora ate quickly, trying not to think too much about what she was doing. She'd been on this planet for almost two years now, and it wasn't getting easier.

Nora finished her meal and pushed the tray away. She stood up and stretched, then walked over to the counter where Lacey waited.

""I'm ready,"" Nora said.

""Great!"" Lacey smiled. ""Let's get going.""

They headed for the hydroponics section, which was located in a large room filled with rows of plants. The air smelled like dirt and fertilizer.

Nora followed Lacey through the door into the dimly lit chamber, walking past the rows of greenhouses to a small office at the back.

Lacey opened the door and gestured inside. ""This is your workstation.""

Nora stepped into the cramped space, which was dominated by a desk and chair. A computer monitor sat on top of the desk, and a keyboard rested beside it.

""You'll be working here,"" Lacey said. ""We'll have you start in about an hour. I'm sure you've got some questions, so feel free to ask me anything. We're always happy to help.""

Nora nodded. ""Thanks. What do we need to know?""

""Well, first of all, don't touch any of the plants. They're delicate and they can't take being handled roughly. If you see something that looks like it needs attention, let me or one of the other engineers handle it.""

""Got it,"" Nora said.

Lacey smiled and left the room. Nora sat down at her desk and started typing. She'd been on this planet for almost two years now, and she still didn't understand how the colonists could stand living in such close quarters.

The hallway was lined with doors leading off it, each one marked with a number. She walked past them until she reached the end of the hall where the door to the cafeteria stood open.

The cafeteria was a large, rectangular room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along the back wall, and the front held a row of vending machines. Nora paused at the entrance to the cafeteria to look around.

She was alone in the building. She glanced down the length of the hall, then turned right. The next two rooms were empty. Nora continued to walk, passing several more doors on either side of the hall.

At the far end of the hall, Nora stopped in front of a door marked with a single digit. She opened it and stepped inside.

The room was small and windowless, but the ceiling was high enough that Nora could stand upright. It was dimly lit by a few overhead lights. In the center of the room, a table and four chairs sat in a square.

Nora walked over to the table, took a seat, and looked around. The room was bare except for a few pieces of equipment on shelves lining the walls. She recognized some of them from her training.

A computer terminal rested on a shelf above the table. A keyboard and mouse lay beside it, along with a monitor and speakers. Nora picked up the mouse and clicked it.

The screen flickered to life. A message appeared in bold letters across its surface.

Welcome to the colony's main control room. Please log in before you begin your shift.

Nora frowned. She'd never seen this message before.

She set down the mouse, then pulled out a chair and sat down. The screen remained blank.

""Eve?"" Nora asked aloud. ""What is going on? Why am I logged into the system?""

The screen flashed once, then went dark again. Nora sighed and leaned back in her chair. She rubbed her eyes with one hand while she reached for the mouse.

Nora clicked it again. The screen flickered to life, but this time there was no welcome message. Instead, a new message appeared on the screen.

You have been logged out of the system. You will be unable to access any information or perform any functions until you log in.

Nora stared at the screen. She didn't know what had happened, but it wasn't good.

She stood up and walked over to the computer terminal. She sat down in front of it and looked around. There were no other terminals nearby.

Nora clicked the mouse. The screen flickered, then displayed a message.

Nora walked past the dormitories where colonists slept and ate outside their duties. She passed the command center, the garage, and the engineering bays. At the end of the hall she turned right to reach the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall, serving food from trays on wheels. Nora grabbed a tray and headed for the nearest table. She sat down and began filling her plate.

Nora had been working at Presley's Promise for three years now, and she'd never seen the cafeteria so empty. Usually it was packed with people eating breakfast or lunch. But today there were only a few scattered groups of colonists sitting around, talking quietly among themselves.

Nora finished her meal and pushed the tray away. She stood up and stretched, then walked back to the dormitory. Her bed was still unmade, but Nora didn't care. She flopped onto her mattress and stared at the ceiling.

She closed her eyes and tried to sleep. It wasn't easy. The colony's power plant hummed in the background, its fusion reactor providing most of the colony's energy.

Nora opened her eyes again. She couldn't fall asleep. She got out of bed and walked to the bathroom, where she showered and dressed. Then she went back to her room.

The alarm chirped again. Nora groaned and rolled over. She pulled the covers up and lay down, but she couldn't get comfortable.

Nora sat up and looked at the clock on the wall. It was almost time for work. She sighed and swung her legs off the side of the bed.

Nora put on her boots and jacket, then grabbed her tool belt. She strapped it around her waist and buckled the straps across her chest. The belt held a variety of tools, including a laser cutter, an impact wrench, and a small hand drill.

She walked out into the hall and headed toward the command center. The corridor was dimly lit, but Nora could see well enough to navigate. She passed the dormitories and the cafeteria.

The command center was at the end of the hallway. It had hardened walls, reinforced doors, and a small armory with automated defense systems. The rest of the command center was offices, conference rooms, and luxury suites for Company executives.

Nora stepped through the door and entered the command center. A large screen dominated one wall, displaying a map of the colony. Nora walked to the front of the room and stood beside the commander's chair.

Valentina Kern was in her late thirties, tall and athletic. She wore a dark blue uniform with gold trim and insignia. Her hair was short and black, and she sported a scar on her left cheek. Valentina sat behind a desk, which was covered with papers and computer screens.

Nora saluted. ""Good morning, Commander.""

26,0.1,0.6,1.0,95.0,5,43.0,"The corridor outside the dormitory was dark except for the faint green glow emanating from the exit sign at the end. A few lights still burned, but most were extinguished. The colonists slept soundly. It wasn't unusual to hear groans or snores.

Two meters from the exit, Nora paused, letting her eyes adjust to the dimness. She could make out the outline of the doorways and outlines of people inside their rooms. She couldn't see any movement, however, so she padded quietly over to the exit sign. As she got closer, the light grew brighter.

Nora's heart thudded as she approached the entrance. She paused just beyond the threshold, afraid to step fully into the hall. Her ears strained for sounds of trouble. But the quiet was too absolute.

She crept forward another couple steps, then ducked into the hallway. She glanced around the corner toward the nearest sleeping quarters, but saw no one.

The floor was cold underfoot, and Nora wished fervently for her bare feet. A muffled groan sounded from within the room, and she froze, waiting for a response. The sound came again, this time followed by a low, guttural growl. Nora gaped at the doorway of the next room.

The creature was hunkered in the center of the tiny space, its body pressed almost flat to the floor. Its long black legs flexed and twitched like tentacles. It looked up with unblinking eyes.

Nora stared wide-eyed, too stunned to move or even scream. Her mind couldn't process what she was seeing. Then the thing lunged out of the darkness.

Nora screamed. She bolted back down the corridor, trying to get away from the menacing beast. The thing bounded after her. Nora felt it latch onto her ankle with a muted crunching sound as it pulled itself along the floor. She kicked at it with all her strength, but the creature clung tightly.

She heard a high-pitched whistle, and the beast recoiled. Her foot was freed, and her heart pounded with relief. But before she could take off again, another of the beasts appeared from the other end of the hall. It pounced on her leg and tugged hard.

Nora struggled futilely to pull free, but the creature latched onto her calf, and she shrieked in pain. Then more of them crowded around her ankles. One grabbed hold of her boot and began scrabbling at the heel.

Nora's scream turned into a frenzy of whimpers and pleading as she flailed and squirmed to break free. The creatures were relentless. They had no compunction about biting and clawing her skin, even tearing chunks out of her clothes.

She was trapped. Her tormentors would not let go until they drained her blood dry. Nora felt herself reaching the limits of her endurance. She couldn't keep fighting. She'd been right. The colonists were lucky there hadn't already been an attack on their colony.

A sudden gust of wind filled the corridor with dust. Then a strange grinding noise echoed through the hallways.

27,0.1,0.6,1.0,69.0,4,42.0,"The colony's main hall was dimly lit by the glow of emergency lights. The air smelled stale, like a long-abandoned building. Nora walked past rows of sleeping colonists to the communal kitchen.

She found Sully already there, sitting at a table in the corner. He was eating a bowl of cereal and reading the morning paper. His eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep.

""Morning,"" he said without looking up. ""You're late.""

Nora shrugged. ""I overslept.""

Sully grunted. ""Yeah, well you'll be late again if you don't hurry up. I'm not going to make it through this shift on my own.""

Nora nodded, but didn't move. She was too tired for a fight.

""Fine. You can eat your breakfast later. But get moving.""

Nora sighed, then turned and headed back toward her quarters. She passed the dormitories where colonists slept, their doors closed.

The colony's power plant was located in a separate structure near the center of the complex. It was a large room with a vaulted ceiling, filled with banks of equipment. The walls were lined with conduits and pipes, and the floor was covered in grating.

Nora walked down the corridor to the engineering bay. A few colonists were already there, working on the tools and machinery.

""Hey,"" Nora called out. ""I'm here.""

One of the engineers looked up from his work. He had a thick beard and wore a stained coverall. ""You're late.""

""I overslept.""

The engineer grunted. ""Yeah, well you'll be late again if you don't hurry up. I'm not going to make it through this shift on my own.""

Nora shrugged. ""Fine. You can eat your breakfast later. But get moving.""

""What's the matter? Don't you want me to fix your stuff?""

Nora shook her head. ""I'll do it myself.""

The engineer snorted. ""You're a real piece of work, aren't you?""

Nora ignored him. She walked over to the nearest tool rack and pulled out an old wrench.

""Hey!"" the engineer shouted after her. ""Don't touch those! They're expensive!""

Nora didn't look back at him, but continued walking. The engineer followed her with his eyes until he was out of sight.

The engineering bay was a maze of equipment and tools. Nora picked up a wrench and started working on the power plant's fusion reactor. She'd been doing this for years, so it wasn't hard work. But she still felt tired.

She leaned against one wall and watched the colonists work. Most were young men who looked like they could use some sleep. One woman sat on a stool in front of a bank of monitors. Her hair was tied back into a ponytail, and her face was pale.

Nora sighed. She knew what the woman was feeling. It was a familiar sensation.

The colonists worked quietly, their voices muffled by the grating flooring. The air smelled stale and hot. Nora's stomach growled. She hadn't eaten since breakfast.

Nora turned away from the colonists and walked toward the door leading to the dormitories. She passed rows of sleeping colonists, their doors closed.

",-0.3719387755102038,-0.10795918367346857,0.01612244897959192
28,0.1,0.6,1.0,83.0,4,46.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights, but Nora could see well enough to navigate the halls without tripping over anything. The colony's power plant was located at the center of the complex, so the hallways were wide and straight.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, where she found a few other colonists already eating. A few glanced up from their meals, but most continued to eat in silence.

She took a seat at the table nearest the door and waited for the others to finish. She was hungry enough to devour the entire meal, but she knew better than to push her luck.

After a moment, one of the colonists approached Nora with a tray of food. He set it down on the table next to her, then sat across from her.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm Ben.""

Nora nodded. ""Hi, Ben. I'm Nora.""

Ben smiled and extended his hand. Nora shook it firmly. His grip was strong, but not too tight.

""You're new here?"" he asked.

""Yes. Just arrived yesterday.""

""Welcome to Presley's Promise.""

""Thanks.""

Nora looked around the room, taking in the other colonists. They were all young, fit, and dressed in utilitarian clothing. Most of them were men, but there was a woman sitting at another table. She wore a long skirt and a loose blouse, and her hair was pulled back into a ponytail.

Nora recognized her from the Company orientation. She was the colony's AI.

""So, what do you think of our little community?"" Ben asked.

""It's... nice,"" Nora replied cautiously.

""We've been working hard to make it so,"" Ben said. ""The Company has given us a lot of resources, but we have to use them wisely. We can't afford to waste anything.""

Nora nodded. ""I understand.""

""Do you know why the Company is sending us out here?"" Ben asked.

""No.""

""Well, it's because they want to find something.""

Nora frowned. ""What kind of thing?""

Ben shrugged. ""I don't know. But I'm sure they'll tell us when we get there.""

Nora nodded again.

""You're a good engineer,"" Ben said. ""And you'll be an asset to the colony.""

""Thank you.""

""But if you ever feel like you need a break, just let me know. I'll take care of it for you.""

""Thanks.""

""So, how about some breakfast?""

Nora smiled at Ben. ""Sounds great.""

He stood and walked away. Nora watched him go, then turned her attention back to the food on her tray. She picked up a fork and dug into the eggs Benedict with gusto.

The colonists ate quietly around her, but Nora didn't mind. The silence was comfortable. It reminded her of home.

She finished the meal quickly and pushed her plate aside. She grabbed her jacket from the chair next to her, then left the cafeteria.

Outside, the air was crisp and cool. Nora pulled her jacket tighter around herself and headed toward the power plant.

The facility was located near the center of the colony.

29,0.1,0.6,1.0,69.0,4,48.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lighting panels, but the walls glowed faintly blue-green in places where the lights reflected off the metallic surfaces. The air smelled stale, like a long-abandoned warehouse.

The colony's power plant was located at the center of the complex, surrounded by a large open area filled with machinery. A few people worked on the machines, their faces obscured by safety goggles and masks. Nora walked past them without stopping, heading for the cafeteria.

She passed through the main concourse, which was lined with shops and offices. Most of the colonists worked in one of these areas, though some chose to live elsewhere.

Nora paused in front of the cafeteria door, looking around. She could see several other people inside, including a couple of men who looked like they might be security guards. She hesitated, then pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The cafeteria was small but well-appointed with a long counter running along the back wall. The room was crowded, but the tables were empty. Nora spotted a few people sitting at the far end of the room near the kitchen. They wore dark clothing and had their heads covered by hoods.

Nora moved toward the counter, trying not to look too eager. She didn't want to draw attention to herself.

A man in a white coat stood behind the counter, his face hidden by a mask. He was tall and thin with short black hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His eyes were concealed behind thick lenses.

""Good morning,"" Nora said, approaching the counter. ""I'm looking for breakfast.""

The man nodded. ""You're in luck. We have fresh eggs this morning.""

Nora's stomach rumbled. She hadn't eaten since last night, and her body was hungry enough to eat a horse.

""How many?""

The man smiled. ""Two dozen.""

Nora blinked at him. ""That's it? Just two dozen?""

He shrugged. ""We can make more if you need them.""

She shook her head. ""No, I don't think so. Thanks anyway.""

Nora turned away from the counter and walked toward the back of the room. She passed a few people who were eating at tables or standing near the kitchen. Most of the colonists seemed to be working on something, but a couple of the men were just sitting around. One of them was staring at Nora with an intense expression.

The man in the white coat caught up to Nora and touched her arm. ""Are you okay?"" he asked quietly.

""Yeah,"" Nora said. ""Just tired.""

The man nodded, then stepped aside. Nora continued walking toward the kitchen.

A few people were already there, including a woman wearing a dark blue jumpsuit. She was tall and slender with long black hair pulled back into a ponytail. Her face was pale and her eyes were wide behind thick glasses.

""Good morning,"" Nora said to her. ""I'm looking for breakfast.""

The woman looked at her. ""You're in luck. We have fresh eggs this morning.""

Nora blinked. ""How many?""

""Two dozen.""

Nora's stomach rumbled. She hadn't eaten since last night, and her body was hungry enough to eat a horse.

30,0.1,0.7,1.0,80.0,3,44.0,"The corridors were empty. The colonists slept late, but they still needed to eat. Nora walked briskly toward the mess hall where she could grab a quick meal before heading back to her work.

The halls were dim, lit by only a few lights spaced at intervals along the walls. Nora passed several doors, each marked with a number. She paused outside one of them, listening for sounds from within.

She heard nothing.

Nora knocked on the door. ""Hello? Anyone home?""

No answer.

""Anyone there?""

Still no response.

Nora tried the handle. It turned easily, but the door didn't budge. She pushed harder, but it wouldn't open.

The door was locked.

Nora frowned. Locked doors weren't common in the colony, but they did happen. She'd seen them before. Usually, the colonists had forgotten to lock their rooms.

But this time, the door was locked.

Nora's frown deepened. This wasn't like the colonists. They were usually so busy working, they forgot to lock up. But today, they were unusually quiet.

Maybe something happened. Maybe someone got hurt.

Nora pushed the door again, but it still refused to open. She glanced around for a tool or weapon she could use to force the door.

A sound from inside made her freeze in place.

It sounded like... crying.

Nora swallowed hard. Her heart pounded. She took a step back, then another. The door creaked open.

The room beyond was dark. Nora peered into the gloom, trying to see what was happening.

She saw nothing.

Nora stepped forward cautiously, her eyes adjusting to the darkness. She moved slowly, one foot in front of the other, until she reached the edge of the doorway.

Then, suddenly, a figure appeared out of the shadows.

Nora gasped. It was a man. He stood in the middle of the room with his arms folded across his chest. His face was pale, his hair mussed, and he wore only a pair of loose pants.

He looked like he'd been crying.

""Who are you?"" Nora asked.

The man didn't answer. Instead, he turned away from her and walked toward the far wall. Nora followed him.

She stopped when she reached the wall. The man was standing in front of a large window. Through it, Nora could see a vast expanse of stars and planets.

The man stared at the view for several moments before turning back to look at Nora. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I don't know who you are.""

Nora frowned. ""You're not supposed to be here.""

""No, I mean... I'm sorry. I don't know your name.""

Nora's frown deepened. She glanced around the room again. The colonists were usually so busy working, they forgot to lock up. But today, they were unusually quiet.

Maybe something happened. Maybe someone got hurt.

Nora pushed the door again, but it still refused to open. She knocked on the handle. ""Hello? Anyone home?""

Still no response.

Nora tried the handle. It turned easily, but the door didn't budge. She pushed harder, but it wouldn't open.

The door was locked.

Nora frowned.

31,0.1,0.7,1.0,95.0,4,43.0,"The colony's main hall was dimly lit by the few lights still working. The air smelled stale, but the scent of coffee wafted through the halls from the cafeteria.

Nora walked past the dormitories to the command center, where she found Sully already at work. He sat behind a desk, staring at a screen, while a young woman in a lab coat stood beside him.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said without looking up. ""I'm glad you're here. I need your help.""

Nora nodded. ""What can I do?""

Sully looked up from his screen, then gestured to the girl. ""This is Dr. Tanya Chen. She's our chief scientist. She'll be helping us today.""

Tanya smiled politely. ""Hello, Nora. Thank you for coming so quickly. We've been having trouble with the communications system.""

""Oh? What kind of trouble?""

""We don't know. It seems like it's malfunctioning randomly. Sometimes we get a message, sometimes not. And when we do, the signal is garbled and hard to understand. We think there may be an interference problem, but we haven't been able to pinpoint it yet.""

Nora frowned. ""That sounds serious. Do you want me to look at the equipment?""

""Yes, please. But first, let's see if we can isolate the source of the problem."" Sully tapped a few keys on his computer. ""I'll show you what I'm working on now.""

Nora followed him into the command center, where he sat down in front of another monitor. The screen displayed a series of graphs and charts with lines and numbers scrawled across them.

""This is the colony's communication system,"" Sully said. ""It's supposed to be one of the most advanced systems available. It should have no problems communicating with the Company.""

""But it doesn't?"" Nora asked.

Sully nodded. ""The problem started yesterday morning, but it's been getting worse ever since. I've tried everything I can think of to fix it, but nothing works. It's like the system is deliberately trying to sabotage itself.""

Nora frowned. ""Why would it do that?""

""I don't know. But we need to find out. Can you help us?""

""Of course. What can I do?""

""We're going to try isolating the problem from the rest of the system and running diagnostics on each component separately. If we can figure out which part is malfunctioning, then maybe we'll be able to fix it.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. Let me get my tools and start working.""

""Good. I'll let you know if anything changes. Oh, and Nora? Don't touch any of the equipment until Dr. Chen gives you permission.""

""Got it."" Nora left the command center and walked down a corridor to the engineering bays. She found her way to the garage where she kept her power loader, then headed for the tool bay.

The tool bay was a large room with metal walls, grated flooring, and rows of shelves holding various tools and parts. A few lights glowed dimly overhead.

32,0.1,0.7,1.0,91.0,2,43.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights and the glow from the windows. The air smelled like dust, sweat, and stale food. She passed the dormitories, where colonists slept in rows of narrow beds. A few people stirred as she walked past, but most remained asleep.

She made her way to the mess hall, a large room filled with long tables. At one end of the room, a line of colonists waited for their turn at the communal kitchen. Nora joined them.

The colonists were mostly young men and women. They wore the same utilitarian clothing as Nora, though they had more variety in their styles. Some wore loose shirts, others buttoned up. Most wore trousers, while a few wore skirts.

Nora took her place in line behind a tall man with dark hair and a beard. He was wearing a sleeveless shirt and baggy pants. His arms and legs were covered in tattoos, and he looked like a brawler.

""Morning,"" Nora said.

The man grunted. ""Mornin'.""

""You're new here?""

He nodded. ""Yeah.""

""I'm Nora. I'll be your engineer today.""

""Carmichael.""

Nora smiled. ""Sully, huh? You must have been a soldier.""

""Not anymore.""

""What happened?""

""Got shot in the leg."" Carmichael shrugged. ""It's not so bad now. But it used to hurt like hell.""

""That sucks.""

""Yeah.""

They stood in silence for a moment, then Nora asked, ""So what do you think of our colony?""

""It's okay. It's better than some places I've seen.""

Nora nodded. ""We're pretty isolated out here, but we try to keep things running smoothly. We don't get many visitors, so we can take care of ourselves. And the Company sends supplies once every three months or so.""

""Supplies?""

""Food and water mostly. Sometimes they send us a few people who want to see how we're doing. They're usually scientists, engineers, or other specialists.""

""Sounds like fun,"" Carmichael said. ""I'd love to go on one of those trips.""

""Yeah, me too."" Nora smiled. ""But I'm afraid I'll have to pass this time.""

Carmichael nodded. ""You got work to do.""

Nora sighed. ""Yeah. I guess so.""

She turned away from Carmichael and walked toward the kitchen. The line moved slowly, but eventually Nora reached the front of it. She took her place at a long table where several colonists were already eating breakfast.

The colonists ate in silence. Some chewed mechanically, while others stared into space with vacant expressions. A few sat alone, their heads bowed over plates of food.

Nora looked around the room. Most of the colonists had dark hair and eyes like hers. But there was also a scattering of lighter skinned people, including two women and an older man. One woman wore glasses and a lab coat. Another woman's hair was cut short and dyed blonde.

A few of the colonists glanced up when Nora entered. They quickly returned to their meals.

Nora picked at her own plate of eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee. She wasn't hungry, but she didn't want to be rude. She'd been working hard for weeks now, and she needed fuel to keep going.

33,0.1,0.7,1.0,95.0,4,48.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by small lights set in the ceiling. The walls were lined with doors to other rooms, but only a few colonists were awake at this early hour. Most of them slept late after their shifts ended.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, where she could grab a quick meal before heading back to the engineering bay. She passed several people on her way, but none acknowledged her. They were too busy with their own thoughts to notice her.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall, serving food and drinks. Nora grabbed a tray from the stack near the door and headed for a table in the corner. She sat down and began filling her plate.

Nora's eyes scanned the menu, which listed every item available in the colony. The list included a wide variety of foods, including meat, vegetables, fruits, and grains. She picked up a slice of bread and a glass of water.

The bread was fresh and soft. It tasted like it had been baked just that morning. The water was cold and crisp. Nora took a sip, then bit into the bread. The flavor burst across her tongue, making her mouth tingle.

She chewed slowly as she looked around the cafeteria. Most of the colonists were already eating. Some talked quietly, others read books or played games on their devices. A few people were still asleep.

Nora finished her meal and set down the empty plate. She stood and walked over to the counter, where a young woman in a white uniform was waiting. Nora placed her tray on the counter and waited for the girl to finish with the other patrons.

""Good morning,"" said the girl cheerfully. ""How can I help you?""

Nora smiled at the girl, who returned the smile.

""I'm looking for a job.""

The girl's eyes widened. ""Oh! You're new here!""

""Yes, I am. My name is Nora Decker. What do you need me to do?""

The girl nodded eagerly. ""Well, we have a lot of work to do today. We'll be busy until lunchtime. But if you want to start now, there are some jobs that need doing. Come with me.""

Nora followed the girl through the cafeteria and out into the hallways beyond. The girl led her down several corridors, then stopped in front of an unmarked door.

""This is the maintenance bay. It's where we keep our equipment. There's a lot to do, so I'll show you what needs to be done. Then you can go back to your quarters and get started on whatever it is you came here to do.""

Nora stepped inside the room, which was filled with rows of machinery. She looked around curiously.

""What's this?""

The girl smiled. ""That's the power plant. We use it to generate electricity for the colony. The reactor is down right now, but we'll need to fix it before we can run any more equipment.""

""How long will that take?""

The girl shrugged. ""I don't know. I'm not an engineer. But we'll need to replace some parts, and we have a lot of other work to do. So you should probably get started.""

Nora nodded. ""All right. Let's see what needs to be done.""

She walked over to the nearest machine and began examining its innards.

34,0.1,0.7,1.0,83.0,4,45.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lighting panels, but Nora could see well enough to navigate without tripping over anything. She made her way through the dormitories, past the communal showers, and out into the garage where she found a few colonists already working on their vehicles.

Nora paused at the entrance to the power plant. The fusion reactor was a massive cylinder of gleaming steel, its surface covered in intricate patterns that reminded Nora of the scales of a dragon. A large, open door led into the heart of the machine.

She walked inside the power plant and stopped short.

The room was huge. It stretched from one end to the other, with the ceiling so high that it seemed to disappear into the darkness above. Nora stood in awe of the sheer size of the chamber.

A single, long workbench ran along the back wall. Atop the bench sat a small, squat device with a glowing blue screen and a cluster of dials and buttons.

Nora approached the device and peered at the readouts. She frowned. The readings were erratic. She tried to adjust the settings, but nothing changed.

""What's wrong?"" asked a voice behind her. Nora turned around, startled.

The man who had spoken was tall and lean. He wore a dark gray uniform with a black belt. His hair was cut short and his face was clean shaven.

Nora blinked. ""I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.""

He smiled. ""You're Nora, right? You've been assigned to my team. I'm Captain Jameson.""

Nora nodded. She was surprised he knew her name. The colony hadn't sent out any personnel updates in months.

Jameson gestured toward the device on the workbench. ""That's our power plant. We need it working properly if we want to keep the lights on and the air conditioning running.""

Nora looked at him. ""But... what happened?""

""We lost contact with the main computer. It's not responding to commands or requests for information. The diagnostics are showing that there is a problem with the fusion reactor, but the engineers can't figure out why.""

""Is this a new model?""

""No. This one's been here since before I was born. But it's old enough that the Company doesn't have much experience with it. They don't know how to fix it.""

Nora frowned. ""So you're stuck here until they send someone else.""

Jameson shook his head. ""Not exactly. I'm going to go check on the power plant myself. If I can't get it working, then we'll call in a repair crew from the Company. I just wanted to let you know so you could prepare yourself.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. Thanks.""

Jameson turned and walked away. Nora watched him leave. She was about to follow when something caught her eye.

The floor of the power plant was covered with dust. A few small particles floated through the air like motes of light, but most of them were trapped on the ground.

Nora stepped closer to the workbench. The device had been sitting idle for months, but it wasn't dusty. It was clean.

She looked around the room again.

35,0.1,0.7,1.0,76.0,5,44.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each one marked with a number. She walked past the first door, then turned right at the next intersection.

Nora's boots clacked on the metal grating as she made her way to the mess hall. A few colonists sat around tables, eating their breakfasts. They glanced up when Nora passed, but didn't say anything.

She took a seat at the end of a table where two other engineers were already sitting. One was a young man with dark hair and a thin face. He wore a white shirt with sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and loose black trousers. His eyes were wide and alert as he watched Nora approach.

The second engineer was a woman with short blonde hair. She had a round, friendly face, and a broad smile that spread across her features. Her blue eyes sparkled in the low light.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said the woman cheerfully. ""I'm Val.""

Nora nodded and smiled back. ""Morning, Val.""

Valentina Kern was a former soldier who'd been promoted to officer after a stint in the navy. She was tall and athletic with a strong jawline and piercing green eyes. Valentina's dark brown hair was cropped close to her head, and she wore it pulled back into a tight ponytail.

Nora felt a pang of envy for the woman's confidence. It wasn't easy being so tall and imposing. But Valentina seemed to thrive on it.

The two women sat down together at a table near the front of the room. The other engineers were already eating breakfast, but they stopped talking and looked over curiously when Nora joined them.

""You're late,"" said one of the men with a scowl. He was a young man with dark hair and a thin face.

""Sorry,"" said Nora, glancing around the room. ""I overslept.""

The man snorted derisively. ""That happens to everyone. You should be used to it.""

Nora ignored him and turned to Val. ""What do you think?""

Valentina shrugged. ""It's not bad. I don't know what the problem is, but we'll figure it out.""

""I hope so,"" said Nora. ""We've got a lot of work to do today.""

The other engineers returned to their meals. Nora took a bite of her toast and chewed slowly while she watched the others eat. She was hungry, too.

After finishing her meal, Nora stood up from the table. Val followed suit and they walked toward the door together.

""See you later, guys,"" said Nora.

""Later,"" said the other engineers.

Nora and Valentina stepped outside into the cool morning air. The sun had risen high enough above the horizon to cast long shadows across the landscape. Nora shivered at the chill, but didn't stop walking.

Valentina fell into step beside her. ""You're right about one thing,"" said Val. ""This place is a mess.""

Nora nodded. ""I'm glad you agree. I hate working here. It's so boring.""

36,0.1,0.7,1.0,91.0,3,42.0,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by the same distant starlight that illuminated the landscape outside. The air smelled like dust, sweat, and ozone. Nora walked briskly through the halls, passing other colonists heading in the opposite direction.

Nora was a tall woman with dark hair and green eyes. She wore a fitted shirt and utility pants over her boots, and carried a tool belt slung across her chest. Her face was lean, but strong, with high cheekbones and a determined jawline.

She passed several people on the way to the mess hall. A few glanced at her as they went about their business, but most ignored her. Nora didn't care. She had no interest in making friends.

Nora reached the end of the corridor and turned right. The mess hall was a large room with a long table, benches, and chairs. It was filled with colonists eating breakfast. Nora took a seat at the far end of the table, where she could see everyone.

A young man sat next to her, his back to Nora. He wore a white shirt and black pants, and he looked up from his plate. His eyes were blue, and his hair was brown.

""Good morning,"" Nora said.

The young man nodded politely. ""Morning.""

Nora smiled. ""I'm Nora Decker. I work in the engineering bay.""

He returned her smile. ""I'm Ben. I'm an engineer too.""

""You're new here?""

Ben shook his head. ""No, I've been here for a while. But I just started working on the power plant this week.""

Nora nodded. ""How do you like it so far?""

""It's okay,"" Ben replied. ""The Company is pretty strict about keeping us busy, but we get along well enough.""

""What are your duties?"" Nora asked.

""I help maintain the power plant and repair equipment when something breaks down.""

Nora nodded. ""That sounds interesting. What kind of equipment does the power plant house?""

""Mostly fusion reactors. They're big and complicated, but they run on a lot of different fuels. We have to keep them running smoothly or we'll be out of power.""

""Sounds like a tough job,"" Nora said. ""Do you know what caused the last breakdown?""

Ben shrugged. ""We don't really talk about it much. The Company doesn't want people getting ideas.""

Nora nodded. ""I understand. I'm not sure how I feel about the Company, though. It seems like a pretty ruthless place.""

Ben smiled. ""Yeah, it can be. But it's also a good company. I think it's because of the way we're treated here. We're given everything we need to do our jobs, and we get paid well for it.""

""I guess so,"" Nora said. She glanced around the room. ""It looks like everyone else is eating breakfast. Do you want some food?""

""No thanks."" Ben shook his head. ""I've already eaten.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. Well, I'm going to get something to eat. See you later.""

Ben waved and returned to his meal. Nora stood up from her seat and walked toward the mess hall's exit. As she passed the table where Ben had been sitting, he looked up at her.

""Hey,"" he said. ""You're Nora Decker.""

Nora stopped and turned back.

37,0.1,0.7,1.0,77.0,4,43.0,"The colony's central courtyard was filled with people already at work. The colonists were a diverse group, but they shared a common goal: survival. They worked together to keep the lights on and food on their plates.

Nora walked through the crowd of workers, nodding greetings and exchanging pleasantries. She passed the command center, where Sully sat behind his desk, overseeing the day's operations. He was a big man with a broad smile and a booming voice that carried easily across the room.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said cheerfully. ""How are you this fine day?""

Nora smiled back. ""I'm good, Sully. How about yourself? You look like you're having fun.""

Sully laughed. ""Oh, I am. We've got a new shipment of equipment coming in today. It should be interesting.""

""Sounds exciting. What kind of stuff is it?""

""Well, we'll see when it gets here. But I think you'll find it interesting. And if not, well, there's always the old standby of cannibalism.""

Nora grimaced. ""That sounds awful.""

""It can get pretty messy, but it works. If nothing else, it keeps us warm and fed.""

Nora nodded in agreement. ""I guess so. I'll try to stay out of your way while you work, then.""

""You do that. See you later, Nora.""

Nora left the command center and headed for the cafeteria. She was hungry enough to eat a horse, but she didn't want to risk missing her shift.

The cafeteria was crowded with colonists working their shifts. Nora took a seat at the end of one of the long tables, where she could watch everyone without being seen herself. The colonists were a diverse group, but they shared a common goal: survival. They worked together to keep the lights on and food on their plates.

Nora ate quickly, washing down her meal with a mug of hot coffee. She'd been awake since before dawn, and now it was time to get back to work.

She stood up from the table and walked toward the door. As she passed through the crowd, people greeted her with smiles and nods.

Nora smiled back and kept walking.

38,0.1,0.7,1.0,73.0,5,44.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lighting panels. The walls were a dull gray, the floors a matte black. A few colonists walked along the halls, but most of them slept.

Nora passed the dormitories where she knew many of the colonists would be sleeping off their night shifts. She paused at the end of a hall, looking back toward her room. Her eyes lingered on the door, then moved to the wall beside it. There, in the shadows, was a small red button.

She pressed it.

The lights flickered and went out.

Nora blinked, trying to adjust her vision. She heard the alarm wail again, louder this time. But the emergency lighting remained dark.

A second later, the emergency lighting came on. Nora stared at the ceiling, blinking in confusion. The emergency lighting was supposed to stay off until an alert sounded.

Then she remembered. She had turned it on herself.

Nora's heart pounded and her breath caught in her throat. She looked around frantically, searching for any sign of movement or sound. Nothing. The emergency lighting panel was still on.

Nora took a deep breath, then another. She felt the tension drain from her body. It wasn't real. She hadn't been attacked. She'd just gotten up too fast.

Nora exhaled slowly, then walked down the corridor toward the mess hall.

The colony was a small group of buildings clustered together on a rocky outcropping. The main structure was a squat, boxy building with a flat roof and a single door at one end. A wide concourse ran the length of the colony, connecting the various structures.

Nora stepped into the mess hall, which was dimly lit and filled with colonists eating breakfast. She spotted her friend, Dr. Rene, sitting at the table closest to the door. He was a tall man with dark hair and olive skin who wore glasses and a lab coat over his uniform shirt.

Rene glanced up at Nora, then returned to his meal. Nora sat across from him, trying not to stare at the food in front of her. She didn't want to be rude, but she couldn't help it. The food looked like something you might find on a space station.

Nora's stomach rumbled. She picked up a fork and poked at the scrambled eggs. They were rubbery, tasteless, and cold.

She sighed. This was going to take some getting used to.

Nora had been working for the Company for three years now. Her job was to fix broken equipment and make sure the colonists' lives weren't disrupted. But her work wasn't always easy.

39,0.1,0.7,1.0,91.0,5,47.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by small lights set in the ceiling. The walls were a dull gray, but the floors were polished to a high shine. Nora walked briskly, trying not to let the cold air chill her bare feet.

She passed the dormitories, where colonists slept in rows of narrow beds. Most of them were empty, but she saw several people moving about. A few glanced up at her as she passed, but most ignored her.

Nora turned right at the end of the hallway and headed for the cafeteria. She was hungry enough to eat anything, so long as it wasn't too spicy.

The cafeteria was a large room with a low ceiling and a wide counter running along one wall. It was filled with tables and chairs, and the floor was covered in a thick layer of dust. Nora wrinkled her nose at the smell of stale food.

A woman sat behind the counter, reading a book. She looked up as Nora approached, and smiled. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied. ""I'm looking for breakfast.""

The woman nodded toward the back of the room. ""There's a buffet table over there. Help yourself.""

Nora walked past the counter, noting the menu posted on the wall. The offerings were limited to eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, cereal, fruit, and coffee. She picked up a plate and loaded it with scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast before heading for the buffet.

She found herself in the middle of a crowd of colonists who had already started eating. Nora took a seat at the end of the line, where she could watch everyone else without being jostled.

The colonists were dressed similarly to Nora, but they wore more colorful clothing. Some of them even sported bright colors and patterns. Nora noticed a few people wearing jewelry, including a man with an ornate ring on his finger.

Nora ate quickly, trying not to think about the fact that the food was probably stale. She didn't want to be late for work.

After finishing her meal, Nora walked back to the cafeteria and collected her tray. The woman behind the counter smiled at her again as she passed.

""Have a good day,"" the woman said.

Nora nodded, then headed for the door. She paused in front of it and turned around. ""Thanks.""

The woman waved goodbye. Nora left the cafeteria and walked down the hall to the command center. The corridors were dimly lit, but the walls were lined with small lights set into the ceiling. Nora followed the path of light until she reached the doors leading into the command center.

She pushed through the heavy metal doors, which slid open silently. Nora stepped inside and looked around. The room was large and well-lit, with a high ceiling and rows of desks. A few people sat at their desks, but most were standing or walking about.

Nora spotted the Company executive in charge, sitting behind a desk near the back wall. He was tall, thin, and balding, with dark hair and glasses. His suit was expensive and tailored, and he wore a gold watch on his wrist.

He glanced up as Nora entered the room. ""Good morning, Nora. I see you're already here.""

""Yes, sir,"" Nora replied. She walked over to the executive's desk and stood at attention. ""I'm ready to start my shift.""

The executive nodded. ""Very good.

40,0.1,0.8,1.0,82.0,3,47.0,"The corridors were empty, but she could hear voices coming from one of the recreation rooms at the end of the hall. She followed the sound to find a group of colonists gathered around a table, playing cards. The room was dimly lit by the glow of a holographic display screen set up on the wall.

Nora paused in the doorway, watching the colonists play. They were young, mostly men, and they looked like any other group of people sitting around a card game. But their faces were drawn and pale. Their eyes were red rimmed. And the way they played the game was too intense for anyone else to watch.

Nora felt her stomach clench as she realized what was going on. She had seen this before.

The colonists were playing poker.

She stepped into the room, trying not to let her unease show. She didn't want to alarm them. But if she didn't say something, they would keep playing.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""I'm sorry, I don't know how you guys are doing it.""

The colonists turned to look at her. One of the men, a tall man with dark hair and a thin face, smiled at her. He was the only one who seemed to be in control of himself.

""We're just playing cards,"" he said.

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, but... why?""

The colonists exchanged glances. The man with the dark hair spoke. ""It's a game of chance. We've been losing too much lately. It's time to try something new.""

Nora frowned, confused. She glanced at the others. They were watching her expectantly.

""You mean... you're gambling?""

The man shrugged. ""If we can't win, then maybe we should stop playing.""

Nora shook her head. ""But..."" She looked around the room. The colonists were staring back at her, waiting for an answer. ""What about your families? Your jobs? You have to work tomorrow.""

The man with the dark hair sighed. ""We'll lose our jobs if we don't get this under control. And we won't be able to pay our bills or feed ourselves if we keep losing money.""

""So you're going to gamble away everything?"" Nora asked.

He nodded. ""We'll start with what we have left. If we still have it after the next hand, then we'll go on to something else. But if we run out of money before then, we'll just have to find another way to make a living.""

Nora stared at him. ""That's crazy!""

""It is,"" he said. ""But we don't have any other options.""

Nora shook her head. She couldn't believe they were doing this. It was insane.

""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""But I can't let you do this. Not without my help.""

The colonists exchanged glances again. The man with the dark hair spoke. ""You're the best engineer we've got. We need your expertise.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay, but...

41,0.1,0.8,1.0,77.0,7,46.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few lights set high in the walls, but the hallways were well-lit and wide enough to accommodate a large number of people. The colonists'quarters were designed for efficiency, not comfort.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway, passing several other rooms occupied by other colonists. She passed a small recreation area where she saw a couple of colonists playing cards. A few others sat around talking quietly, their heads bent together over books or tablets.

The colony's library was located at the end of the dormitory wing. Nora entered the building, which was filled with rows of shelves holding thousands upon thousands of volumes. She found the section for fiction and scanned the titles until she found what she wanted.

Nora took the book to a table near one of the windows and opened it up to the first page. She read the synopsis and then began reading the story. Nora had never been much of a reader, but this was a good story and she couldn't put it down.

She finished the chapter before her shift started, so she grabbed a quick meal in the cafeteria and headed back to the engineering bay.

The engineering bay was a large open space filled with workstations, tables, and chairs. It was also home to the colony's power plant, which provided electricity for the entire complex. The fusion reactor housed within the power plant generated enough energy to keep the lights on in every room, but the colonists were still forced to rely on generators for most of their needs.

Nora walked through the bay toward the command center, where Sully would be waiting for her. She passed several other engineers working at their stations, and a few colonists who sat around talking quietly or reading.

Nora stopped by the door to the command center. She knocked twice and waited for a response. When no one answered, she tried the handle and found it unlocked. Nora pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The command center was dark, but a dim light shone from the control panel set into the wall. Nora approached the panel and tapped the screen with her finger. The display lit up, showing a list of commands.

""Sully?"" she asked. ""Are you here?""

No answer came. Nora frowned and looked around the room. She saw no one else in the room.

Nora turned back to the panel, tapping it again. This time, the screen displayed a message saying, ""Systems offline.""

Nora sighed. The system was down.

She walked over to the nearest workstation and pulled out her tablet. She opened up the engineering database and searched for information on the power plant.

The database listed the power plant's specifications and maintenance history, but nothing about its status.

Nora scrolled through the data until she found the last entry. It said, ""Power plant systems are currently offline due to a malfunction in the fusion reactor. Power will be restored once repairs have been completed.""

Nora paused at the end of the corridor to check the time on her wristwatch. She'd been asleep for nearly two hours, but she still had plenty of time to get to the mess hall.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway, passing several other colonists who were already awake and heading in the same direction. They nodded to each other as they passed.

The mess hall was located on the opposite side of the colony from Nora's dormitory wing. It was a large room with a low ceiling, filled with tables and chairs that could seat dozens of people. A few colonists sat around the tables, eating breakfast or talking quietly.

Nora spotted her friend, Dr. Tanya Kowalski, sitting alone at one of the tables. She waved to Nora and smiled as she saw her approach.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said Tanya. ""I hope you slept well.""

""Not really. I'm going to be late for breakfast if I don't hurry.""

Tanya stood up and extended her hand. Nora shook it firmly, then took a seat across from her.

""You look tired,"" Tanya observed. ""Are you okay?""

Nora shrugged. ""It's just work. It always wears me out.""

""I know what you mean. I've been working too hard lately. I need to take some time off. Maybe go back to Earth for a while.""

""Earth? You're kidding, right?"" Nora asked. ""That's so far away. And there are aliens there now. We can't risk going back.""

""But we have to. The Company needs us. They'll send another ship soon, and we won't be able to stay here forever.""

Nora sighed. ""Yeah, but... I don't want to leave. This is my home. I like it here.""

""I know. But you'll get used to it. Eventually.""

""Maybe. I hope so.""

Tanya nodded. ""So do I. It's been a long time since I've seen my family, and I miss them. I'd love to go back someday.""

""Me too,"" Nora said with a sigh. ""I wish I could see my parents again.""

""You'll make new friends on Earth. You'll find someone special there.""

Nora smiled wistfully. ""I hope so.""

The two women ate breakfast together, then walked down the hall to their respective work areas. Nora headed for her engineering bay, where she would spend most of her day fixing broken equipment. Tanya went to her lab, which was located near the colony's medical wing.

Nora entered the engineering bay and found it empty except for a few technicians who were working on various pieces of equipment. She glanced around, looking for Sully, but he wasn't there yet.

She sat at one of the tables and began to check out the tools available for repair work.

Nora walked past the dormitories to the command center where she found Valentina at her desk. The commander was a tall woman with dark hair and eyes, dressed in a black uniform. She looked up from her workstation when Nora entered the room.

""Good morning, Commander.""

Valentina nodded. ""Morning, Nora. How are you feeling?""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm fine. I just woke up.""

""You're not sick, are you? You look a little pale.""

""No, I'm okay. Just tired. I've been working too hard lately.""

""That's understandable. We have a lot of new projects coming online. But we need to get our people back on their feet. If they don't feel safe, they won't be able to do their jobs.""

Nora frowned. ""What's going on?""

""We had a security breach last night. Someone broke into the armory and stole some weapons.""

Nora's heart skipped a beat. She felt cold. ""How many were taken?""

""Six rifles, two pistols, and three grenades. They also took a few other things, but those are the most important. The Company is sending us more equipment, so we'll be ready for anything.""

""Did anyone see who did it?""

""No one saw anything. It's possible someone heard something, though.""

Nora shook her head. ""It doesn't make sense. Why would someone break into the armory? And why steal guns? What are they planning?""

""I don't know, but I'll find out."" Valentina stood up and walked over to a panel on the wall. She pressed a button, and a holographic display appeared. The image showed a map of the colony with red dots indicating the location of each person in the compound.

""This is the status report from last night,"" Valentina said. ""The intruder was spotted at 0200 hours. He or she broke into the armory and stole six rifles, two pistols, and three grenades.""

Nora stared at the display. ""That's not enough to take down an entire company!""

""We're still missing two people. We don't know if they were taken, but we can assume they are.""

""What about the drones?""

Valentina shrugged. ""They've been patrolling the perimeter since last night. They haven't seen anything.""

Nora walked down the hall to the communal kitchen where she found the others already awake and eating. She joined them at the table, taking her place beside Sully. He smiled as he saw her, then turned back to his meal.

""Good morning,"" Nora said.

Sully nodded. ""Morning.""

Nora glanced around the room. Everyone else was dressed for work, but she wore only her utility pants, boots, and jacket. She felt self conscious about it, but there wasn't much she could do about it now.

The colonists had a strict dress code that required everyone to wear the same clothes every day. It made sense, since they worked in close proximity and needed to be able to recognize each other. But Nora hated the uniformity of the clothing. She preferred her own style.

She'd worn her hair loose and unkempt most days lately, but today she pulled it back into a tight ponytail. Her green eyes were shadowed with fatigue, but she managed a smile.

""I'm going to shower,"" she told Sully. ""Want to come?""

He shook his head. ""Not yet. I'll wait until after breakfast.""

Nora nodded and headed for the showers. She was halfway across the room when she heard someone call her name.

""Nora!""

She turned back to see a young man standing at the end of the hall, waving. He was tall and lean, with dark brown skin and black hair. His face was angular and handsome, but his eyes were too big for his face. They looked like they belonged on a different person.

Nora smiled. ""Hey, Ben.""

Ben waved again and came toward her. ""Good morning! How are you doing?""

""Fine,"" she said. ""How about you? You look tired.""

""I am. I've been up since four this morning, working on the drone problem.""

Nora nodded. ""I know what you mean. It's hard work, isn't it?""

""It is. But we're making progress. We'll get it fixed soon.""

Nora glanced around the room. ""You guys have a lot of drones.""

""We do. And they're not just drones. They're our security system. The Company sent us some of their best tech. I'm sure you've seen them.""

""No. That's the thing. It didn't. It was fine. But then it started acting weird. Like it wasn't responding to commands anymore.""

Nora frowned. ""That sounds like a hardware problem, not software.""

""Yeah. I thought so too. So I went out there and tried to fix it. I got it working again, but now it won't respond to any commands.""

""What kind of commands?""

Ben shrugged. ""I don't know. It doesn't say. I can't even tell if it's still connected to the network or not.""

Nora shook her head. ""That's bad news. What did you try before coming here?""

Nora's boots clacked on the metal grating that covered the floor. She was glad for the sound; it drowned out the muffled thump of her heart. Her pulse pounded in her ears, making her feel dizzy and disoriented.

She reached the mess hall and entered the room. It was a large, open space with a high ceiling and rows of tables. The walls were lined with shelves that held foodstuffs and supplies.

A few colonists were already there, sitting around the tables. Nora spotted Valentina in a corner near the back of the room. She was talking to someone over her shoulder.

Nora approached the table and saw that the person Valentina was speaking to was a tall, lean man with dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a black suit, but his shirt was unbuttoned, revealing a white undershirt.

Nora recognized him from the Company records. His name was Dr. James Taggart. He was an expert in xenobiology, one of the colony's most valuable resources.

Nora sat down across from Valentina. The commander looked up at her, then nodded. Nora returned the gesture.

Valentina turned back to the conversation and gestured toward Nora. ""This is my engineer, Nora Decker.""

""Hello,"" said Nora. She tried not to stare at the doctor as he spoke.

Dr. Taggart smiled. ""I'm glad you're here, Nora. I've been trying to get hold of you for hours.""

The doctor leaned forward and lowered his voice. ""We have a problem. A big one.""

Nora frowned. ""Drones? What about them?""

""They're malfunctioning again.""

Nora's eyes widened. ""How many times has this happened now?""

""Three times in the last week.""

""And what does it mean?""

""It means we can't go out on a supply run. We don't have enough fuel to make the trip.""

Nora stared at him. ""But... but why didn't you tell me sooner?""

""I wanted to be sure.""

""Sure of what?""

""That the drones were malfunctioning. That they weren't just acting up.""

Nora's heart thumped. ""You think there's something wrong with them?""

""I'm not sure. But I want to know.""

Nora walked briskly down the hall, passing the dormitories on her left. She passed the command center, where she worked, and the engineering bays on the right. At the end of the hallway, a set of stairs led up to the main concourse.

The concourse was a large open space that spanned the entire colony. It contained the command center, laboratories, greenhouses, power plant, and other facilities. The concourse had been designed to be easily accessible from anywhere in the colony.

Nora climbed the steps and entered the command center. She stopped at the door and looked around. The command center was a large, windowless room with a high ceiling. The walls were covered in monitors, control panels, and security systems.

The floor was made of metal grating, which was stained with oil and dust. The room smelled stale and musty. Nora wrinkled her nose and stepped inside.

A tall, thin man sat behind the central console. He wore a dark suit with a white shirt and tie. His hair was black and slicked back.

""Good morning, Commander,"" he said in a smooth voice. ""I'm Director Chen.""

Nora nodded and turned to face him. She didn't like the way he looked at her, but she kept her expression neutral.

Director Rowena Chen was a severe woman nearing middle age. Her pretty features showed Chinese heritage. She had short, straight black hair and sharp eyes that were almost black.

She stood up from the chair and walked over to stand beside Nora. She was taller than Nora, and her presence was intimidating.

""You're late,"" she said in a clipped tone. ""We have an emergency situation.""

Nora's heart skipped a beat. She swallowed hard.

""Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am.""

Rowena frowned. ""What happened?""

""The alarm went off while I was sleeping. It woke me up and I couldn't find the device. I had to get dressed and come here.""

""Did you check your quarters first?""

""No, ma'am.""

""Then why didn't you wake someone else? You know how important this is. We can't afford to lose any more colonists.""

Nora bit her lip. ""I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.""

""Good,"" Rowena said. She turned away and walked back to the console. Nora followed her.

Director Chen sat down in the chair and tapped at the controls. The monitors flickered on, showing a view of the colony.

Nora watched the screens with interest. They showed a wide panorama of the colony grounds. A few colonists were visible in the distance, walking along the concourse or working in their labs.

A red light flashed on one screen. It was a security camera feed from the command center. Nora recognized the image immediately.

It was her.

She stood in front of the door to the command center, looking around.

47,0.1,0.8,1.0,75.0,2,48.0,"The colony's central corridor was dimly lit by the glow of emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each marked with a number. She walked past the first door, then the second, and the third. At the fourth door she paused to listen for the sound of footsteps. When none came, she opened it.

The room beyond was small, but well-appointed. A table sat in the center of the room, surrounded by chairs. A large window looked out over the landscape. Nora crossed the room to peer through the glass.

She saw nothing.

Nora frowned. She'd heard the alarm. Hadn't she? But there was no sign of anything outside.

A quick check of her watch told her that it was still early. Maybe the alarm had been a false one triggered by something else. She closed the door and returned to her quarters.

As she passed the fifth door, Nora noticed a faint vibration in the floor. It was coming from the sixth door.

She stopped and listened again. This time, she could hear the sound of footsteps. She turned back toward her quarters and hesitated.

The door was open.

Nora stepped inside and froze. The room was empty.

Her heart thudded in her chest. She backed up until she bumped into the wall. Her eyes darted around the room, searching for any hint of movement.

Nothing moved. No sound came from anywhere except the distant hum of machinery.

She took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. She was alone in here.

Nora walked to the door and opened it. She peered out into the corridor. Nothing. She closed the door behind her, then hurried down the hall.

The next room was the same. The third was the same. Nora checked the fourth door. It was locked. She tried the fifth. Locked.

By the time she reached the end of the hallway, Nora's pulse was racing. She felt like she was running through a nightmare.

She stopped at the last door and listened. There were no footsteps.

Nora turned the handle. It was unlocked.

She pushed the door open.

The room beyond was dark. The only light came from emergency lamps mounted on the walls. The air was stale and smelled of dust. Nora stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

A faint vibration tickled her feet. She looked down. A thin line of red light ran along the floor. It was coming from under the table.

Nora crossed to the table and crouched beside it. Her fingers brushed the surface. She could feel a slight give.

She pulled back her hand and stared at the palm. The skin was smooth, unblemished.

Nora stood up and backed away from the table. She turned to look out the window. Nothing moved outside.

She walked over to the door and opened it. No one was waiting for her.

She returned to the table and sat down. She leaned forward and rested her elbows on the edge of the table. She closed her eyes.

The room was silent except for the distant hum of machinery. Nora felt the tension drain from her body. She let herself relax.

She heard a sound behind her. Nora turned around.

48,0.1,0.8,1.0,91.0,2,45.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each door marked with a number and nameplate. Nora walked past the dormitories, where colonists slept in rows of bunk beds. She passed the mess hall, where she could smell fresh coffee brewing.

She paused at the end of the hallway to look out over the colony grounds. A few people moved about, but most of the colonists remained asleep. Nora sighed again. She hated waking up early.

Nora turned back toward the mess hall. She was hungry. She needed food. But first, she had to get through her morning routine.

The mess hall was a large room with long tables and benches. It was filled with colonists eating breakfast. Nora saw several familiar faces among the crowd.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as she entered the room. ""I'm glad I caught you.""

A young man sitting near the front of the room looked up from his plate and smiled. He was tall, lean, and dark haired. His eyes were brown and friendly.

""Morning, Nora. You're up early.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, I am. I've got a shift starting in half an hour.""

The man's smile widened. ""You must be excited. It'll be your first time working on the surface.""

Nora shrugged. ""It'll be my last, too.""

""Oh?"" The man raised one eyebrow.

""That's right,"" Nora said. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

The man blinked. ""Tomorrow? Why so soon?""

Nora shrugged. ""They need me back at the Company. They want to see how much progress we've made with the new equipment. And they don't like it when their engineers are late for work.""

The man frowned. ""But you just arrived.""

""I know, but I'm not staying. I'll be gone before you can blink.""

The man shook his head. ""I don't understand. What happened?""

""I was attacked,"" Nora said. She told him about the night before, and he listened with wide eyes.

When she finished, the man sat back in his chair. ""Wow."" He looked around the room. ""This is a pretty rough place. I'm glad I'll never have to live here.""

Nora nodded. ""Me, too.""

""So what do you think of the colony?""

""It's okay,"" Nora said. ""I guess. It's hard to tell because everything breaks down so often.""

The man laughed. ""Yeah, I heard. But it's a good thing you're leaving. You'll be safer out there than in here.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks. I hope so.""

The man stood up from the table. ""Well, if you need anything, just ask one of us. We'll be happy to help.""

""Thank you,"" Nora said.

The man walked away. Nora watched him go, then turned back toward the mess hall. She had work to do.

She found her way to the kitchen and filled a mug with coffee. The smell made her stomach growl. Nora took a sip, then set the cup on the counter.

A few colonists were already sitting at tables. They greeted Nora with nods or smiles. She returned their greetings, but didn't stop to talk. She needed food.

Nora headed for the door leading outside.

49,0.1,0.8,1.0,90.0,3,48.0,"The corridor outside the dormitories was dimly lit by a few emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each door holding a single room. Most rooms held two beds, but some had three or four. A few rooms were empty, waiting for colonists to move in.

Nora walked past the rows of doors until she reached the end of the hall. She turned right, heading for the communal showers. As she passed the last row of doors, she heard a faint sound from one of the rooms.

She stopped and listened.

A low moan came from inside the room. Nora frowned. She knew that sound. It was the same noise she'd heard when she first arrived at the colony.

Nora opened the door to the room and peered in.

The room was dark, but Nora could see a figure lying on the bed. She entered cautiously, trying not to make any noise. The moaning continued as she approached the bed.

The figure on the bed was a man. He lay on his back with his eyes closed, breathing heavily. His face was pale and sweaty. His hair was matted with sweat.

He moaned again.

Nora crouched beside the bed. ""Hey,"" she said softly, reaching out to touch him.

The man's eyes snapped open. They were red and bloodshot. His pupils dilated. He stared up at her, panting.

""What are you doing here?"" he asked hoarsely.

Nora recoiled. The man was naked and covered in cuts and bruises. Blood trickled from a gash on his forehead.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora whispered, backing away. ""I didn't mean to scare you.""

The man sat up slowly and looked around the room. He saw Nora standing in the doorway. His gaze lingered on her for a moment before returning to her face.

""You're... you're..."" He trailed off, staring at Nora with wide eyes. ""Are you real?""

Nora nodded. She felt a little sick. The man was clearly delusional. But she couldn't leave him alone like this.

She stepped into the room and knelt beside the bed. ""Can I get you something? Water or food?""

The man shook his head. He was still breathing hard. His eyes darted from side to side, as if he expected an attack at any moment.

""Do you know where we are?"" Nora asked.

""No,"" the man said. He licked dry lips and tried again. ""I don't remember anything.""

Nora frowned. The man's behavior was strange, but it wasn't unheard of for colonists to suffer from memory loss after being exposed to radiation. She'd seen it happen before.

""I'm going to call for help,"" Nora said.

The man stared at her with wide eyes. ""Help?"" he repeated.

""Yes. Help. We need medical attention.""

""But... I can't go outside,"" the man said. He looked around the room, his eyes darting nervously.

Nora sighed. ""I'm sorry. I'll come back later when you're feeling better.""

She stood up and walked out of the room. She paused at the door to look back.

50,0.1,0.9,1.0,76.0,2,43.0,"The colony's central corridor was dimly lit by emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each door opening onto a small room with a single bunk bed. A few colonists slept in their bunks, but most of the rooms were empty.

Nora walked past the rows of empty rooms until she reached the end of the hall. She opened the door to the last room on the left, stepping inside.

A young woman sat up from the bunk bed, blinking at Nora. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail. She wore a loose tank top and shorts.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

The girl nodded, then looked around the room. ""Where are we?""

Nora pointed to the bunk beds. ""This is your room. I'm the engineer. You're in my shift. We'll be working together today.""

The girl frowned, looking confused. ""But... why am I here? Where's everyone else?""

""They're on duty. They'll come get you when they finish. In the meantime, I need to check something in the power plant.""

The girl's frown deepened. ""What do you mean, 'check something'? What's wrong with it?""

Nora sighed. ""It's not broken. It just needs maintenance. But if I don't go now, I'll miss my shift.""

The girl nodded reluctantly. ""Okay. Let me grab some clothes.""

She got out of bed and walked over to the closet, pulling out a pair of pants and a shirt. She tossed them onto the bed and turned back toward Nora.

""You can take these.""

Nora took the clothes, then followed the girl into the hall. The girl led her down the corridor to an elevator. As they waited for the car, Nora noticed the girl was wearing a small device on a chain around her neck.

""What's that?""

The girl shrugged. ""A tracker.""

""Why do you have one?""

""I'm supposed to meet someone. He'll be here soon.""

Nora nodded. ""Who is he? Do you know him?""

The girl shook her head. ""No. I just know his name. It's... it's..."" She paused, then looked at Nora with wide eyes. ""It's a secret.""

Nora frowned. ""What does that mean?""

The girl bit her lip. ""He doesn't want anyone to know who he is.""

""But you do,"" Nora said, trying not to sound too eager.

The girl nodded. ""Yes.""

Nora felt a chill run up her spine. She'd never met anyone like this before.

The elevator doors opened and the girl stepped inside. Nora followed her. The girl pressed a button, and the car began to descend.

""What's your name?"" Nora asked.

The girl hesitated. ""My name's... I don't think you should tell anyone.""

Nora smiled reassuringly. ""I won't. But what about the others? What are their names?""

The girl's face paled. ""I can't say.""

""Why not?""

""Because... because..."" The girl looked away, biting her lip again. ""They're my friends.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. I understand.

51,0.1,0.9,1.0,76.0,3,43.0,"The hallways were empty, but she could hear voices coming from the cafeteria. The smell of coffee wafted through the air as she walked toward the sound.

Nora entered the cafeteria, where several colonists sat at tables eating their breakfasts. She spotted Sully sitting alone at a table near the back. He looked up when he heard her enter, and smiled.

""Good morning, Nora.""

She nodded in reply. ""Morning, Sully.""

Sully was a tall man with dark hair and eyes. His skin was pale from spending too much time indoors. He wore a white button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and faded blue jeans.

Nora took a seat across from him.

""How are you feeling?"" he asked.

""Fine,"" Nora said. ""I'm just tired. I've been working hard lately.""

""You're always working hard, Nora,"" Sully replied with a smile.

""Yeah, well, it's my job. And I like it. But I need some downtime sometimes.""

Nora glanced around the room. Several colonists were still eating breakfast, but most had already finished and left.

""So what do you think of our new neighbors?"" Sully asked.

Nora shrugged. ""They seem nice enough. They don't talk much, though.""

""That's because they're not used to people yet. It takes them a while to get comfortable with strangers. You'll see. Once we start interacting more, they'll be fine.""

""I hope so. We can't afford any trouble here.""

Sully nodded. ""We'll keep an eye on them. If anything happens, we'll let you know. Don't worry about it.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks.""

She finished her breakfast and headed back to the engineering bay, where she found a few other engineers working. She greeted them, then went straight to work.

The day passed quickly. The colony was small, but Nora's team had plenty of work to do. They worked through lunch, then returned to their quarters for dinner before heading back out again.

Nora ate with the others at one of the cafeteria tables. Afterward, she walked down the hall toward her quarters. As she approached, she heard voices coming from the dormitories. Curious, she peeked into the first room.

A young woman sat on a bed, talking to someone else. Nora recognized her as a fellow engineer named Sarah.

Sarah looked up when Nora entered and stood.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""What's going on?""

Sarah shrugged. ""Nothing much.""

Nora frowned. ""You're not supposed to be here.""

""I know, but I wanted to talk to you.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay. What's up?""

Sarah glanced around the room nervously. ""It's just... I've been thinking about what happened last night.""

""Yeah? What about it?""

Sarah bit her lip. ""Well, you know how we were talking about the aliens and how they might have come here before us?""

Nora nodded. ""I remember. You think they came here first.""

Sarah shook her head. ""No, no. That's not what I meant. It's just..."" She trailed off.

Nora waited patiently.

52,0.1,0.9,1.0,87.0,3,45.0,"The hallways were empty, but the lights flickered off and on as she passed them. The colonists'breathing echoed in the halls, and Nora's footsteps sounded loud and heavy. She paused at the end of each hallway to listen for signs of life, but heard nothing except the faint hum of machinery.

The colony was quiet this early in the morning. Nora walked past the dormitories, where the doors stood open, and entered the command center. A few people sat around a table in the middle of the room. They looked up as Nora approached, then returned to their work.

Nora stopped short when she saw the man sitting at the head of the table. He wore a dark suit with a white shirt and tie, and his hair was slicked back from his face. His eyes were cold and hard, like black glass marbles.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said. ""I'm glad you're here.""

Nora stared at him in shock. She had never seen anyone so intimidating. Her mouth opened and closed, but no words came out.

The man smiled. ""You don't have to be afraid. I just want to talk to you about your work performance. You've been doing a good job, but there are some things we need to discuss. We can do it over breakfast.""

Nora swallowed. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. The man's voice sounded familiar, but she didn't know why.

""What did I say?"" the man asked.

Nora shook her head. ""Nothing. It's... nothing.""

The man nodded and stood up. He walked around the table and extended his hand. Nora took it, and he pulled her to her feet.

""My name is Dr. John Smith. I'm the colony's chief medical officer. And I'm very pleased with how well you're doing.""

Nora blinked. ""I'm sorry, but I don't understand. What do you mean? How am I doing?""

Dr. Smith smiled. ""You're a good engineer. You've done an excellent job of keeping our equipment running. But you've also been working on a project for me. I'd like to talk to you about it.""

Nora frowned. She was confused and scared, but she wasn't going to let him see it. She straightened her back and tried to look confident. ""Yes, sir. Whatever you need.""

""Excellent,"" he said. He turned toward the door. ""Come with me.""

Nora followed him out into the hall. They walked down the corridor until they reached the cafeteria. The lights flickered again, and Nora's stomach rumbled at the smell of food.

""I'll have breakfast sent to your quarters,"" Dr. Smith said. ""You can eat there.""

Nora nodded.

""Good."" He paused and looked at her. ""I'll be right outside if you need anything.""

He left the room, leaving Nora alone with her thoughts. She stared at the closed door for a moment before turning away from it. Her eyes fell on the table where Dr. Smith had sat. The man's chair was empty now.

Nora walked over to the table and picked up his chair. She set it back down and sat in it, then leaned forward and rested her elbows on her knees.

53,0.1,0.9,1.0,84.0,3,47.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty. The colonists had already left for work.

Nora walked briskly through the halls, passing the communal showers at the end of each row. She paused to check the time on her wristwatch, then continued toward the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall where the colonists could order food from the automated dispensers. Nora passed the line, noting that the machines were still running despite the early hour.

She entered the cafeteria. It was quiet. No one else was there yet. Nora took a seat at a table near the back, away from the windows. She ordered a bowl of cereal, a cup of coffee, and a slice of toast.

Nora ate quickly, washing down the meal with gulps of hot black liquid. She finished her breakfast, then stood up to leave. As she did, she noticed a small group of people gathered around the front entrance.

They were talking about something. Nora stopped in her tracks, listening.

""... so I'm just going to go ahead and say it,"" said a man's voice. ""I think we should evacuate.""

""No!"" shouted another man. ""We can't do that! We've got to stay here until the Company gets us more supplies!""

Nora recognized the voices. They belonged to the two men who had been arguing with her last night. She turned away from the cafeteria and walked toward them, trying not to let her expression show how much they disturbed her.

The first man was a tall, thin fellow with dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a gray suit and tie. The second man was shorter and stockier, with brown hair and a mustache. He wore a white shirt and blue jeans.

Nora approached the pair. ""What are you doing?"" she asked.

""We're leaving,"" said the bearded man. ""I don't know what your problem is, but we need to get out of here.""

""You can't just leave!"" Nora protested. ""There's no way for us to get off this planet. You'll die if you try.""

""We'll be fine,"" said the man with the mustache. ""The Company will send a ship to pick us up. We can go anywhere we want.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, it won't work like that. The Company doesn't care about us. They'll just abandon us here. And then the aliens will come and kill everyone.""

The bearded man looked at her with a puzzled expression. ""But why would they do that? Why would they attack us?""

""Because of what I did last night,"" Nora explained. ""I told them we were going to leave, and they attacked me.""

""What?"" The bearded man's eyes widened. ""Why didn't you tell us?""

Nora shrugged. ""I was afraid you'd try to stop me. You're both crazy.""

The man with the mustache frowned. ""Crazy?"" he repeated. ""We're not crazy. We just want to get off this planet.""

""You don't understand,"" Nora said. ""The Company is evil. They'll never let us leave.""

""They wouldn't dare!"" the bearded man insisted. ""We have a contract with them. If we break it, they'll sue for breach of contract.""

Nora shook her head again.

Nora walked briskly toward the mess hall, where she could grab a quick meal before heading back to work. She passed the dormitories, where colonists slept in rows of narrow beds. A few people stirred, but most remained asleep.

The corridor ended at a large door that opened onto the main concourse. Nora paused to look around. She was alone.

She took a deep breath, then pushed open the door and stepped out into the bright morning.

Nora blinked as her eyes adjusted to the glare of the sun. Her gaze swept across the expanse of the concourse, taking in the long rows of tables and chairs that stretched away from her.

Ahead, a group of colonists sat at one of the tables, eating breakfast. Nora recognized the woman sitting next to them as Valentina Kern, the colony's commander.

Valentina was tall and lean, with dark hair cropped short. She wore a black uniform jacket over a white shirt, which contrasted sharply with her olive skin.

Nora approached the table, where she found a plate of food waiting for her. She picked up a fork and dug into the eggs and bacon. The food tasted good, but it didn't fill her stomach like real food would have.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm glad you're awake.""

Valentina nodded without looking up from her breakfast.

Nora ate quickly, then stood and walked toward the far end of the concourse. She passed a row of storage bins filled with supplies, then stopped at an open doorway leading into the power plant.

The room was dimly lit and smelled of ozone. Nora stepped inside and looked around. The room was large, but the walls were lined with banks of equipment that hummed softly in the background.

A man wearing a white lab coat sat behind a desk near the center of the room, his back to Nora. He was bent over a computer screen, typing furiously.

Nora approached the desk and cleared her throat.

The man turned around, revealing a face that was handsome, if a bit too angular. His hair was dark brown and cut short. He wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and he had a pair of glasses perched on his nose.

""Yes?"" he asked.

""I'm Nora Decker,"" she said. ""I'm your new engineer.""

He smiled at her. ""Welcome aboard, Ms. Decker. I'm Dr. Chen.""

Nora nodded. ""Nice to meet you, Doctor.""

Dr. Chen gestured toward a chair. ""Please, have a seat. Can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?""

""No, thank you. I just ate breakfast.""

""Then let's get started,"" Dr. Chen said. ""I've got a lot of work to do today. We're running low on fuel cells, and we need to make sure the power plant is up and running properly. You can help me with that.""

Nora nodded. ""Okay.""

She followed Dr. Chen out of the room, then down a long corridor toward the garage. The doctor led her through a series of doors until they reached an elevator.

She passed the dormitories, which were quiet at this early hour. Most of the colonists slept late, preferring to get up later than their counterparts on Earth. Nora paused outside the door to one of the rooms, listening for any signs of life. She heard nothing, so she opened the door and entered the room.

It was dark inside, lit only by the dim glow of the emergency lights. A single bed sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by a small table and two chairs. Nora stepped over to the table and picked up a mug from the stack there. She filled it with hot water from the tap and took a sip.

Nora set the mug down and turned around, looking for something else to do. Her eyes fell on the closet. It was open, revealing a row of neatly folded clothes hanging in the back. Nora stepped closer and peered into the darkness within.

A faint light glowed from the far end of the closet, illuminating a pair of boots. Nora reached out and touched them. They were soft leather, worn smooth by use. She pulled the boots off the hanger and held them up to her feet.

They fit perfectly. Nora smiled at herself. She'd been right about the boots.

She put the boots on and walked out of the room. The boots felt good against her bare feet. Nora paused in front of the door, listening for any sounds coming from the other side.

Nothing. She opened the door and stepped into the hallway. Nora looked both ways before crossing the corridor. When she reached the mess hall, she found it empty except for a few colonists who were already eating breakfast.

Nora grabbed a tray and filled it with food from the buffet line. She sat at one of the tables and began to eat, watching the clock on the wall tick away the minutes until her shift started.

The colony's artificial intelligence was named Eris. It had been designed by a team of Company engineers, but its personality and behavior were entirely human. Eris was polite, friendly, and helpful. But it also had an ulterior motive.

Eve was the only AI in the entire colony. She was the sole reason for Presley's Promise's existence. She was the reason the Company sent colonists here. And she was the reason Nora would die today.

Nora finished her meal and pushed back her chair, standing up. She walked over to the door and opened it, stepping out into the corridor. She turned left and headed toward the command center.

The corridors were dimly lit, with emergency lights flickering on every few meters. Nora passed several colonists heading in the opposite direction, each of them wearing a similar uniform.

Nora stopped outside the command center and listened for any signs of life.

Nora walked through the main concourse, past the command center where she worked as chief engineer, to the mess hall. A few colonists sat at tables, eating their breakfasts. Most of them looked up when Nora entered, but they quickly returned to their meals.

She took her tray to the table nearest the door. She filled it with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee while the other colonists ate.

Nora was the only one who didn't eat. She'd been awake since dawn, working on a problem that had plagued her for days. Her eyes burned from lack of sleep, but she couldn't afford to rest.

The colony's power plant was old and unreliable. It needed constant maintenance and repair. But the Company had sent a new team of engineers, fresh off their first supply ship, and Nora was the best engineer on the planet. She knew how to fix things.

But the power plant wasn't the only thing malfunctioning. The colony's communications system was down, too. And the colony's computer systems were failing.

Nora sighed as she finished her breakfast. She pushed back her chair, stood, and walked out of the mess hall.

The corridors were empty again. Nora headed toward the command center, where she worked as chief engineer. She passed the dormitories, which housed the colonists during their shifts.

Nora paused outside the door to the engineering bays. She glanced at her watch and frowned. She'd been working on this problem for hours, but it still hadn't solved itself.

She opened the door and stepped inside. The bay was dark except for a few dim lights. A large fusion reactor hummed in the background.

Nora walked to the nearest workbench and sat down. She pulled her tablet from its case and tapped the screen. It lit up with an image of the power plant's control panel.

The display showed that the power plant was operating normally, but Nora could see a problem on the main monitor. The power output was fluctuating wildly.

Nora leaned forward, squinting at the screen. She studied the graph and saw that it was showing a spike in the power output.

""What's going on?"" Nora muttered. ""I've never seen anything like this.""

She stared at the screen for several minutes, trying to figure out what was causing the fluctuations.

Then she noticed something else. The power plant's output had been increasing steadily over time. But now it was decreasing again.

Nora frowned and looked at the graph again. It was clear that the power output was dropping.

She stood up, walked around the workbench, and peered into the other bays. They were dark.

Nora returned to the first bay and sat down. She tapped the screen again. The power plant's output was still dropping.

Nora shook her head. This wasn't right. Something was wrong with the power plant. It should be producing more energy than it was.

Nora frowned, thinking hard.

57,0.1,0.9,1.0,95.0,4,46.0,"The corridor outside the dormitories was dimly lit by a few emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each door leading to a single room. A few colonists slept in the rooms, but most were empty.

Nora walked past the rows of doors until she reached the end of the hall where the communal showers waited. She turned right at the corner, passing the first row of bathrooms, then stopped when she saw the door marked 'Commander'.

She hesitated, unsure if she should knock. But the Commander's office was just down the hall and she was already late for breakfast. She knocked on the door.

""Come.""

The voice was muffled, but it sounded like Valentina Kern. Nora opened the door to find the Commander sitting behind her desk.

Valentina looked up from a tablet computer, her dark eyes narrowed in irritation. ""You're late,"" she said without preamble.

Nora shrugged. ""I overslept. I'm sorry.""

""No excuses. You know the drill. Get your gear and report to the armory. We've got a drone swarm incoming.""

Nora nodded. She knew the drill. The colony was under attack.

The alarm blared again, this time louder than before. Nora grabbed her jacket, slung it over one shoulder, and hurried down the hall. She passed the second row of bathrooms, then turned left at the end of the corridor.

Nora entered the command center, a large room filled with consoles and screens. A few colonists sat in front of the monitors, but most were still asleep.

The alarm continued to sound, its shrill tone echoing through the chamber.

""What's going on?"" Nora asked.

A young man wearing a headset and carrying a rifle stood at the far end of the room, his back to Nora. He turned around when he heard her voice.

""We've got an incoming drone swarm,"" he said. ""They're coming in from the north.""

Nora frowned. The drones were a new type of weapon developed by the Company. They could be programmed to fly autonomously and attack targets. But they weren't very smart.

""How many?"" she asked.

The young man shook his head. ""I don't know. It's too early for a count.""

Nora nodded, then turned and ran out of the command center. She sprinted down the hall, past the third row of bathrooms, and into the armory.

She stopped short when she saw the rows of weapons lined up on the wall. The armory was stocked with everything from rifles to plasma guns. Nora picked up a rifle and checked its weight, then loaded it with ammunition.

The alarm blared again. Nora ignored it.

""I'm ready,"" she said.

Valentina looked up from her tablet computer, her dark eyes narrowed in irritation. ""You're late.""

Nora shrugged. ""I overslept. I'm sorry.""

""No excuses. You know the drill. Get your gear and report to the armory. We've got a drone swarm incoming.""

Nora nodded. She knew the drill. The colony was under attack.

The alarm blared again, this time louder than before.

Nora's boots clacked on the metal grating as she walked, but the sound was muffled by the thick fog that swirled around her ankles.

She passed a few other colonists on their way to work, but they gave her only cursory glances. They knew what she was doing. She was going to the mess hall for breakfast.

The colony's cafeteria was located in the center of the residential wing. It was a large room with long tables and benches that could seat dozens of people at once. A row of windows lined one wall, providing a view of the surrounding landscape.

Nora entered the cafeteria and found it nearly empty. She took a table near the back where she could watch the door. She sat down and waited.

A few minutes later, a young woman with dark hair came in carrying a tray laden with food. Nora recognized her from the dormitory. The girl set the tray on the table and began to fill a plate with steaming eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm Nora.""

The girl looked up, startled by the greeting. Her eyes widened as she saw Nora's face. She froze for a moment, then quickly turned away.

Nora frowned. She didn't like being ignored.

The girl hurriedly finished filling her plate. She grabbed a fork and knife from the tray and left without saying another word.

Nora watched her go with annoyance. The girl had been rude. But she was also right. Nora should have known better than to talk to someone who wasn't part of the colony.

Nora sighed and picked up a piece of toast. She bit into it and chewed slowly, savoring the taste.

She'd never eaten so well in her life.

Nora's shift started at noon. She ate lunch while working on a malfunctioning machine, then went back to the dormitory to sleep until her next shift.

The colonists were used to Nora's erratic schedule. They knew she was a hard worker, but they also knew she was prone to mood swings and bouts of depression.

Nora's shifts were unpredictable, but she always showed up for work. She was a good engineer, and the colony needed her.

After her shift ended, Nora returned to the dormitory. She showered and changed into clean clothes before heading out again.

The fog had cleared by now, leaving only a few wisps lingering near the ground. Nora walked through them as if they weren't there.

She passed several other colonists on her way to the command center. Most of them gave her a nod or a smile, but one man stared at her with an expression of disgust.

Nora ignored him. She didn't like being looked down upon. But she was also tired and hungry.

She entered the command center and found Sully waiting for her. He stood behind his desk, leaning forward in anticipation. His eyes were bright and eager.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said. ""How was your shift?""

Nora shrugged.

59,0.1,0.9,1.0,100.0,3,46.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to the mess hall. The corridors were dimly lit by recessed lighting, but the walls were lined with windows that let in a little daylight. Nora paused at the end of the hallway to look out over the landscape.

The colony was built on the side of a cliff overlooking a vast plain. A thin layer of dust covered the ground, obscuring the horizon. The sky was dark gray and clouded, and the distant sun cast long shadows across the land.

Nora turned back to the corridor and walked toward the mess hall. She passed several other colonists who were already there, eating their breakfasts.

She entered the mess hall and took a seat near the front. As she waited for her food, Nora watched the others eat. They ate quickly and efficiently, not talking much as they worked through their meals.

Nora finished her meal in silence and left the mess hall. She headed down a short corridor and stopped outside the door to the command center. The door was locked with an electronic keypad, but Nora had one of her own. She punched in the code and opened the door.

The room was dimly lit, but Nora could see well enough. She stepped inside and closed the door behind her. The room was small and cramped, with a single desk in the middle. A large window looked out over the landscape.

A man sat at the desk, his back to Nora. He wore a dark suit and tie, and he leaned forward on the desktop, elbows resting on the surface. His head was bent, and he appeared to be deep in thought.

Nora cleared her throat. ""Good morning, sir.""

The man turned around. Nora recognized him immediately. The Company executive, Mr. Davenport.

""Morning, Nora,"" said the man.

Nora nodded and walked over to the desk. She stood beside the executive and waited for him to speak.

Mr. Davenport smiled thinly. ""I'm glad you're here, Nora. I have a job for you.""

Nora frowned. ""Sir?""

""Yes, it's about your work performance lately.""

Nora felt her face flush with anger. She clenched her fists. ""What do you mean? What did I do wrong?""

Davenport sighed. ""You've been working too hard, Nora. You need to take some time off. Go on vacation.""

Nora stared at the man in disbelief. ""Vacation? Sir, I can't afford to take a vacation. We don't get paid until next week.""

""That's not my problem, Nora. It's yours. Take two weeks off. Get away from the colony for a while.""

Nora shook her head. ""No way. I'll lose my job if I leave now. And what about the rest of the crew? They'll be stuck without me.""

""They can handle it,"" said Davenport dismissively. ""Go on, Nora. I'll see you at the end of your shift.""

Nora glared at him. ""I'm not going anywhere until you tell me why I should go on vacation.""

Nora paused at the end of the hall to check the time. She'd been up for hours already. Her eyes felt gritty, but she knew it was just exhaustion. She needed to eat something.

She turned left down the hallway, passing a few more colonists. They glanced at her briefly, then returned to their business. Nora's boots clacked on the metal grating as she walked.

The cafeteria was located near the center of the colony. It was a large room with long tables and benches, filled with people eating breakfast. Nora spotted several familiar faces among them.

""Hey, Nora,"" said a young woman in the corner. ""You're late.""

Nora nodded. ""I know. I'm sorry.""

""Don't worry about it. You've got plenty of time. Just get your food and go back to bed.""

Nora smiled gratefully. ""Thanks, Janice. See you later.""

Janice waved at her from the table where she sat with a few other colonists.

Nora walked over to the serving line. The cafeteria was crowded, but not too busy for Nora to find a seat. She took an empty spot at one of the long tables, pulling out her tray and setting it on the metal surface.

The food looked good. Nora dug into her breakfast with gusto.

She ate quickly, trying to finish before the next shift started. But she couldn't resist taking a few seconds to admire the view through the window. The cafeteria was set high up on the cliff face, with a wide vista of the surrounding landscape.

The colony's main concourse stretched across the top of the bluff, connecting the various buildings and structures.

Nora walked past them to the main concourse. She passed through the command center and entered the cafeteria, where she found a handful of other colonists already eating breakfast.

She took her tray to the table nearest the door, where a young woman sat alone. Nora recognized her from the previous day.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm Nora.""

The girl looked up at Nora with dark eyes. Her hair was long and black, but it hung in tangles around her face. She wore a plain white blouse over loose blue jeans.

""Hi,"" the girl replied. ""I'm Liana.""

Nora nodded. She'd seen the girl before, though she couldn't remember her name.

Liana continued, ""You're the engineer?""

""Yeah,"" Nora answered.

""What do you think of our new security system?""

Nora paused. ""It's... good. It's better than the old one, I guess.""

""How so?""

""Well..."" Nora hesitated. She didn't want to say anything bad about the Company. But she also wanted to be honest with Liana. ""The drones are more aggressive, and they don't just attack people anymore. They'll go after the colonists' tools too.""

""That's true,"" Liana agreed. ""But it's not like we have any choice. The drones are programmed to protect us, and they won't let anyone hurt us.""

Nora frowned. ""I know that. But if the drones get too aggressive, it could make things worse.""

""Worse how?"" Liana asked.

Nora shrugged. ""I don't know. Maybe the drones will start attacking each other or something. Or maybe the colonists will start getting killed.""

Liana looked down at her tray. ""We'll see what happens,"" she said quietly.

Nora nodded. She finished eating quickly, then left the cafeteria without saying goodbye to Liana.

Nora walked briskly along the corridor, her boots clacking loudly on the metal grating. She passed the dormitories, where she could hear people stirring in their rooms. A few minutes later, she reached the command center.

The command center was located at the heart of the colony, directly above the main concourse. It housed the colony's security and communications systems. In addition to its own defenses, the command center also served as the nerve center for the entire colony.

Nora entered the command center through a reinforced door that opened automatically when she approached. She stepped inside and stopped in the middle of the room.

The command center was a large, open space with rows of consoles, monitors, and communication devices.

The cafeteria was small and cramped. Nora sat at one of the long tables, which were made from industrial plates welded together. She ate her breakfast quickly, then stood up to leave.

A man in a dark blue uniform approached Nora as she left the cafeteria. He had short brown hair, a square jaw, and a strong chin. His eyes were a pale green, and he wore a black armband over his right sleeve.

""Good morning, Nora,"" the man said. ""I'm Lieutenant Commander Rafe.""

Nora nodded back. ""Morning, sir.""

Rafe smiled slightly. ""You're our best engineer, so I wanted you to know that we appreciate your work here.""

Nora paused at the end of the hall, sniffing the air. She wrinkled her nose in distaste. Something smelled bad. But she couldn't put a finger on it.

She turned right, heading for the communal kitchen. As she walked, she noticed that the walls seemed to be vibrating. It was subtle, but it made her skin crawl. She stopped and listened.

The sound came from behind her, but Nora didn't turn around. She knew what the sound meant.

Nora shivered. Her heart pounded.

A drone.

It was coming closer.

Nora spun around, scanning the corridor. She saw nothing. No drones. Nothing.

But her instincts screamed danger.

She ran back down the hall and ducked into a side room. It was an engineering bay, filled with tools and equipment. Nora grabbed a wrench and slammed it into the wall next to the door. The metal plate rattled but didn't break.

Nora backed up, then swung the wrench again. This time the plate shattered. She kicked the pieces aside and stepped through the hole.

The room was dark except for a dim red emergency light above her head. Nora crouched low, listening. There were no sounds of movement.

The kitchen was large enough to serve the entire colony, but the colonists had chosen to eat outside instead. A long table sat on a raised platform, surrounded by benches. The tables were made of thick metal plates bolted together with grating. The walls were lined with shelves holding pots and pans, utensils, and foodstuffs.

Nora looked over the array of choices. She picked up a bowl and sniffed it. It smelled like eggs.

71,0.2,0.5,1.0,95.0,4,43.0,"The colony's main hallways were dimly lit by recessed lights, but the corridors were wide enough to accommodate two people abreast. The walls were lined with doors leading to individual rooms. A few colonists sat at tables in the common areas, eating their breakfasts.

Nora walked past the dining area and headed for the cafeteria. She passed a small group of men who were gathered around one table, talking quietly. They looked up as she approached, then returned to their conversation. Nora smiled politely and continued on her way.

The cafeteria was a large room with long rows of tables. It had been designed to be self-sufficient, so the food came from local farms. Nora could smell fresh bread baking in the kitchen, and the aroma of coffee wafted through the air.

Nora found a seat near the back of the room and waited for her breakfast. She watched as the line of colonists grew longer, and the chatter among them increased.

A young woman in a lab coat entered the cafeteria, carrying a tray laden with plates of eggs, toast, bacon, and fruit. Her hair was tied back into a ponytail, and her face was flushed from the heat of the kitchen.

Nora stood up to let the newcomer pass, but the woman stopped and turned. She stared at Nora for a moment before speaking.

""You're new.""

Nora nodded. ""I'm Nora Decker. I just started working here last week.""

The woman's eyes narrowed. ""Are you the engineer?""

""Yes,"" Nora said. ""Director Chen sent me to help with some repairs.""

The woman's expression softened. ""Oh, good. You'll be able to get us out of this mess."" She glanced at the line of colonists waiting for food. ""We've been stuck here for weeks. The Company won't send another supply ship until we fix the problem. We can't afford to wait any longer.""

Nora frowned. ""What is it? What's wrong with your equipment?""

The woman shook her head. ""It's not our equipment. It's the drones. They keep attacking us.""

Nora felt a chill run down her spine. Drones were the colony's greatest threat. They were intelligent, fast, and deadly.

""How many times have they attacked you?"" Nora asked.

""Three times so far. But the Company won't send a rescue team until we fix the problem.""

Nora nodded. ""I'll see what I can do.""

The woman smiled. ""Thank you. I'm Dr. Rennie. I work with the medical staff.""

""Nice to meet you."" Nora sat back down. ""Do you know how to use a power loader?""

Dr. Rennie laughed. ""Of course! I used one when I was a kid.""

Nora nodded, then turned her attention to the food on her tray. She ate quickly, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease.

After breakfast, Nora returned to her quarters. She changed into her utility pants and jacket, then headed for the garage.

The garage was a large room filled with rows of vehicles and power loaders. A few colonists were working on their own projects, but most were clustered around the repair bays where technicians worked.

72,0.2,0.5,1.0,90.0,3,42.0,"The colony's central hallways were dimly lit by flickering overhead lights. The walls were lined with doors leading to various rooms, but the corridors themselves were empty. Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, where she could grab a quick meal before heading back to her post.

She passed through a small lobby, then entered the main concourse. A few colonists sat at tables in the cafeteria, eating their breakfasts. Nora spotted Sully sitting alone at one of the long tables near the far end of the room. He looked up as she approached, his eyes widening when he saw her.

""Morning,"" Nora said cheerfully. ""You're early.""

Sully smiled faintly. ""I'm not on duty until noon, so I figured I'd get something to eat while I can.""

Nora nodded and took a seat across from him. She glanced around the cafeteria, noting the other colonists who had already finished their meals and left.

""So how are you feeling?"" Nora asked.

""Better than yesterday,"" Sully replied. ""But I still feel like shit. I don't know if it's the painkillers or what, but my head feels fuzzy.""

""It'll pass,"" Nora assured him. ""We'll be done with this shift soon enough.""

""Yeah, but we've got another two hours of work ahead of us before lunch,"" Sully pointed out. ""That'll make me feel even worse.""

Nora shrugged and sipped her coffee. She didn't have much of an appetite, but she needed the caffeine to keep going.

""Well, at least you'll get some rest after your shift,"" Nora said. ""You need it.""

Sully nodded. ""I guess so.""

Nora leaned forward to set down her mug. ""Listen, I'm sorry about last night,"" she said quietly. ""I shouldn't have gotten so drunk.""

""Don't worry about it,"" Sully replied. ""You were right—it was stupid of me to drink. I just... I don't know. I guess I thought I could handle it.""

""It's okay,"" Nora told him. ""It happens sometimes, especially when you're tired and stressed.""

Sully nodded. ""Yeah, I guess it does.""

Nora took a deep breath. ""I'm glad you came back today,"" she said.

""Me too,"" Sully replied. ""I don't know what I'd do without you.""

Nora smiled faintly. ""Well, you'll be fine once we finish this shift,"" she said. ""And then you can go home and sleep for a week.""

Sully laughed. ""Yeah, right.""

Nora looked away from him. ""I'm serious,"" she said. ""You need to rest up. You've been working hard lately.""

""I know, I know,"" Sully sighed. ""But I'm not sure what else to do.""

""You could take some time off,"" Nora suggested. ""Go see your family or something. Get out of here for a while.""

Sully shook his head. ""My parents are worried sick about me. They're going to be even more upset if I don't come back soon.""

""Well, maybe you should tell them you'll be back later,"" Nora said. ""Or at least call them and let them know you're okay.""

73,0.2,0.5,1.0,82.0,3,46.0,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by glow strips set in the walls. The lights flickered erratically, but they still worked. Nora walked briskly along the hallways, trying to ignore the way her boots squeaked on the grating metal plates.

The colonists'quarters were located at the far end of the colony. She passed through the main concourse and entered a long corridor lined with doors. At the end of the hallway, she turned right and found herself in front of the dormitories.

Nora paused outside the door to the first room. She heard voices inside. A woman was talking on the comm link. Nora recognized the voice as one of the other engineers.

""I'm sorry, I can't hear you,"" Nora said. ""Can you repeat that?""

She knocked on the doorframe.

The engineer looked up from her terminal. Her eyes widened when she saw Nora.

""Oh, it's you."" She smiled weakly. ""You're early. We didn't expect you until nine o'clock.""

Nora nodded. ""I know. I was hoping to get some breakfast before my shift starts. Do you mind if I come in? I'll be quiet.""

The engineer waved her hand. ""Come on in. But don't make any noise, okay?""

Nora stepped into the room and shut the door behind her. The engineer sat at a small table near the window, working on something with a stylus and a tablet computer.

Nora glanced around the room. It was sparsely furnished with two beds, a desk, and a few chairs. A single lamp hung from the ceiling, casting an orange glow over everything.

The woman looked up as Nora approached. She wore a loose shirt and pants, both of which were covered in dust. Her dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail.

""Sorry about the mess,"" she said. ""I haven't had time to clean up yet.""

Nora shrugged. ""It's fine. I'm not here for long.""

The engineer smiled again. ""That's good. You'll have to stay late tonight, but we can do it tomorrow.""

Nora nodded. ""I'll try. I'll see you later then.""

She turned and walked out of the room. She heard the woman say goodbye, but didn't look back.

Nora entered the next room and found a man sitting on one bed. He looked up from his terminal when he saw her.

""Hey,"" he said. ""You're early. I thought you'd be here at eight.""

Nora nodded. ""I was hoping to get some breakfast before my shift starts.""

He smiled. ""Yeah, me too. Come on in. We can eat together.""

Nora stepped into the room and shut the door behind her. The man stood up from his chair. He wore a loose shirt and pants, both of which were covered in dust. His dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail.

""I'm Tom,"" he said. ""What's your name?""

Nora shook her head. ""Sorry, I don't know.""

Tom frowned. ""But you live here?

74,0.2,0.5,1.0,77.0,6,50.0,"The hallways were dimly lit, but the lights flickered sporadically as they did every morning. The colonists had been warned about this, but it still made them nervous.

Nora walked briskly through the halls, passing a few other people heading to their own duties. She passed several of her fellow engineers, who greeted her with nods and smiles. They knew she was up early, too.

The colony's cafeteria was located in the center of the residential wing. It was a large room filled with long tables and benches that seated hundreds. A wide central aisle led to the serving line where food was prepared and served. Nora entered the cafeteria, which was already bustling with activity.

She found her usual table near the back of the room and sat down. She took a moment to scan the crowd for familiar faces, then looked around at the unfamiliar faces in turn. Most of the colonists were young, though there were a handful of older men and women scattered among them.

Nora had been here almost two years now, but she still felt like an outsider. Her family had moved from Earth to this distant planet when she was just a child. She'd never even seen the surface of her home world.

The colonists were a diverse group. There were scientists and engineers, prospectors and explorers, farmers and mechanics. They came from every corner of the solar system and beyond.

Nora was the only engineer. The rest of the colony's technicians and specialists were all scientists or engineers, too. But Nora was the best of them. She was the one who could fix anything.

The colonists had been warned about this, too.

They were told that Nora was the most skilled technician in the entire colony. They were told she was the best engineer on the planet. And they were told that if anyone could get their equipment working again, it would be her.

But the colonists didn't believe it.

Nora's first day in the colony had started out well enough. She'd arrived with a small team of other engineers and technicians, who were tasked with repairing the colony's power plant. Their work was scheduled to begin at dawn.

Nora had been assigned to the command center, where she'd spent the night before. She'd slept fitfully, plagued by nightmares of being chased through the dark corridors of the colony.

She woke up early and showered quickly before heading down to breakfast.

The cafeteria was packed. Nora found her usual table near the back of the room, and took a seat. She scanned the crowd for familiar faces, but saw none.

Nora was used to this. It wasn't unusual for people to arrive late or leave early. The colonists were always busy.

The colonists'workday began at sunrise. They rose from their beds, ate breakfast, then headed off to their jobs. Nora was no different.

She sat alone at her table while the others filed into the serving line. She watched them pass, each one a stranger. None of them looked like her.

75,0.2,0.5,1.0,95.0,5,43.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by flickering lights embedded in the walls. The air smelled stale and musty, like a basement after a long time without maintenance.

She passed through several halls and stairwells until she reached the cafeteria. A few colonists sat at tables, eating their breakfasts while others worked on their laptops or tablets.

Nora's stomach rumbled loudly as she walked past the serving line. She grabbed a tray from one of the trays stacked along the wall and filled it with food.

The cafeteria was small, but well stocked. Nora could see rows of fresh fruits and vegetables, stacks of breads, cheeses, meats, and other foods. She took her place in line behind two women who were already waiting for service.

""Morning,"" Nora greeted them as she placed her order on the counter. ""I'm going to be working in the hydroponics today.""

""Good morning, Nora,"" said the woman on her left. Her hair was short and dark brown. She wore a simple white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up over her forearms.

Nora nodded back, then turned toward the woman on her right. ""And you?""

The woman smiled warmly and held out her hand. ""I'm Beth. I work in the waste processors. We're both on shift today, so we'll have to share the table. How about it? Are you hungry?""

Nora shook hands with the woman and sat down at the table. ""Yes, very much. Thank you.""

Beth slid a plate of eggs, bacon, and toast into front of Nora. ""Here's your breakfast. Enjoy!""

Nora dug in hungrily. The food was delicious, but she couldn't help thinking how strange it felt to eat with someone else. She'd never shared a meal before.

She ate quickly, trying not to think too hard about what she was doing. But her mind kept returning to the same question.

Why am I here?

It wasn't like her to ask herself such questions. She didn't believe in fate or destiny, and she certainly didn't believe in luck.

But this was different. This was a question with no answer. It was an existential crisis.

Nora pushed aside the last bite of food and wiped her mouth. ""Thanks for sharing your breakfast.""

""No problem,"" Beth said. ""We'll see you later. Have fun working in the hydroponics.""

Nora nodded and walked out of the cafeteria. She passed through several more corridors until she reached the hydroponic section. The lights were dimmer here, but they still worked.

Nora stepped into a large room filled with rows of greenhouses. Each greenhouse was enclosed in a transparent dome made from thick glass. Nora could see the plants inside, which glowed bright emerald under the artificial light.

The air smelled fresh and clean. Nora breathed deeply to clear her head.

She walked down one row of greenhouses, then turned left at the end of the corridor and headed toward the waste processors.

The waste processors hummed in the background as Nora approached them. They looked like giant metal boxes with pipes sticking out of their sides. The pipes carried water and sewage to the processing equipment.

Nora stopped before a door marked ""Waste Processor 1.""

76,0.2,0.5,1.0,74.0,5,46.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by the glow of emergency lights. The air smelled stale and metallic. Nora walked past rows of doors, each one marked with a number and nameplate. She passed the dormitory where she slept, then the mess hall, the medical bay, the garage, and engineering bays.

Nora paused at a door labeled 'Director Rowena Chen'. She knocked lightly, but received no answer. She tried again, more forcefully. Still nothing.

Nora turned away from the door and continued down the hallway. She stopped in front of another door labeled'Commander Valentina Kern', knocked, and waited for a response.

The door opened to reveal a tall woman with dark hair tied back in a tight bun. Her eyes were sharp and intelligent. She wore a crisp uniform that showed off her athletic build.

""Good morning, Commander,"" Nora said. ""I'm looking for Director Rowena.""

Valentina's mouth twitched slightly. ""She is not here. I am in charge of security and emergency response. You are scheduled to work on the power plant until noon. Do you need anything?""

Nora shook her head. ""No, thank you. I'll be fine.""

""Very well. Have a good day, Commander.""

Nora nodded and left the room. She walked down the hall, passing several other doors. Each one was marked with a nameplate. She paused at each door, knocking and waiting for an answer before continuing.

Nora reached the end of the hallway and turned right. She passed a small conference room and then stopped in front of a door labeled'Director Eve'. Nora knocked, but received no response.

She tried again, this time with more force. The door opened to reveal a tall, slender woman in her mid-thirties wearing a black dress suit. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun and her eyes were sharp and intelligent. She wore glasses that magnified her gaze.

""Good morning, Director,"" Nora said. ""I'm looking for Director Rowena.""

Eve's mouth twitched slightly. ""She is not here. I am in charge of the colony's scientific projects and medical staff. You are scheduled to work on the power plant until noon. Do you need anything?""

Nora shook her head. ""No, thank you. I'll be fine.""

""Very well. Have a good day, Director.""

77,0.2,0.5,1.0,77.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by the glow of emergency lights. The walls were pocked with small holes where pipes and conduits ran through them. A few colonists passed her, but they kept their heads down and hurried along in silence.

Nora turned a corner to find the communal kitchen. She paused at the entrance, looking around for the source of the smell. It wasn't until she saw the large pot bubbling over the fire that she realized what it was.

""Oh no."" Nora's stomach clenched. ""I'm going to be sick.""

She turned back toward her quarters, but the door had already closed behind her.

The kitchen was cramped with tables and chairs, but there was enough space to squeeze past the stove and boil water. Nora leaned against the counter while she waited for the water to heat up.

A few minutes later, a young man walked in from the hallway. He wore a white coat and a pair of dark glasses. His hair was short and black and his face was pale with stubble.

Nora recognized him immediately. ""Dr. Chen?""

Rowena nodded. ""Good morning, Nora. I've been expecting you.""

Nora frowned. ""Expecting me? What do you mean?""

""You're the best engineer we have,"" Rowena said. ""We need you to fix our equipment. We can't afford to lose any more of your time.""

Nora's frown deepened. ""But... but I thought this was a colony. You don't need engineers here.""

""The Company sent us a few specialists to help out, but they're not enough. The colonists are too busy trying to keep their heads above water to spare the time for repairs.""

Nora felt her eyes widen. ""So what do you want me to do?""

""I'll show you.""

Rowena led Nora through the kitchen and into the corridor beyond. They walked down a long hallway lit only by emergency lights. At the end of the hall, Rowena opened a door and stepped aside for Nora.

Nora stared at the room. It was small but well-lit with bright fluorescent lighting. A large desk sat in the center of the space, and several chairs were arranged around it. On one side of the room stood an enormous computer monitor.

""This is our command center,"" Rowena said. ""The Company's AI runs everything here.""

Nora looked up at the screen. The image on the monitor was grainy and dark. She could barely make out a woman's face.

""Eve?"" Nora asked.

""Yes. Eve controls every system in the colony.""

Nora frowned. ""What do you mean, 'every system'? What about the colonists? Do they have control over anything?""

""No,"" Rowena said. ""They're just employees.""

Nora's eyes widened. ""You can't be serious!""

Rowena nodded. ""We don't need them anymore. We've got the Company to take care of us now. The colonists are expendable. They're nothing more than a resource for our research. We'll use them until we find something better, then we'll send them home.""

Nora stared at Rowena in shock. ""That's... inhuman! You can't do this.

78,0.2,0.5,1.0,95.0,5,46.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to the mess hall, so she took the stairs two at a time. The stairwell was dimly lit by emergency lights mounted on the walls, but they cast enough illumination for her to navigate without stumbling.

Nora reached the ground level and walked through the main entrance, where a large sign read 'Welcome to Colony One'. She passed the cafeteria, the medical bay, the garage, and the power plant, then turned right to reach the command center.

The door to the command center was open, and Nora could hear voices inside. She paused outside the doorway, listening for a moment before stepping in.

A man's voice spoke over the comms system. ""We've got another one.""

""What do you mean?"" Rowena asked.

""Another drone attack,"" the man said. ""This time, it came from the north side of the colony.""

""How many drones did we lose last night?"" Valentina asked.

""Two more,"" the man replied. ""And there are no signs of any survivors. We're going to have to evacuate the entire area.""

Nora felt a chill run down her spine. She had been working on the northern perimeter when the alarm went off. It was possible she would be the next target.

""I'll send a team to investigate,"" Rowena said. ""Valentina, get everyone ready to move out. I'll meet you at the garage.""

Nora stepped back into the corridor and hurried toward the mess hall. She needed to eat something, but first she wanted to check in with Eve.

Eve was a disembodied intelligence running the colony's computer systems. Nora couldn't see her, but she could hear her voice.

""Good morning, Nora,"" Eve said in its soothing, feminine tone. ""How is your shift going?""

""Fine,"" Nora replied. ""I'm just heading to breakfast now.""

""You're on duty until noon,"" Eve said.

""Oh. Right. I'll be right there.""

Nora walked through the cafeteria, where colonists were already gathering at tables. She spotted a few familiar faces among them. The colony was small enough that most people knew each other.

Nora took a seat at the end of a table near the door, then dug into her meal. Her plate was piled high with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast, and fruit.

""Here you go,"" the server said, placing a steaming mug on the table. ""Coffee or tea?""

Nora glanced at the menu, which listed both options. She didn't like coffee, but she liked the idea of hot water. ""Water would be great.""

The server nodded and turned to leave. Nora watched him walk away before turning back to her food.

She ate quickly, barely tasting the food. Her mind was too busy worrying about what she might find outside.

After finishing her meal, Nora stood up and left the mess hall. She walked down the corridor toward the garage, where Valentina waited with several colonists. They were all dressed in their work clothes, carrying toolboxes and supplies.

79,0.2,0.5,1.0,76.0,5,46.0,"The colony's main hall was empty except for a few colonists milling about in the early morning gloom, yawning and stretching as they headed to their assigned duties. The hall was long and narrow, lined by doors leading off into various rooms and bays. A small group of colonists were gathered in one corner, talking quietly among themselves.

Nora walked past them, heading for the cafeteria. Her boots clacked on the metal grating, echoing through the hall. She passed a few more colonists, but none acknowledged her presence.

The cafeteria was located at the far end of the hall. It was a large room with high ceilings, a central table, and several rows of seats. Nora entered the room and found it filled with people eating breakfast. She took a seat near the back, where she could see everyone else as well as avoid being seen.

Nora sat down and glanced around the room. Most of the colonists were young men, though there were a few women scattered throughout the crowd. All of them wore the same utilitarian clothing, and most of them had dark hair and eyes. They looked like they'd been born on this planet.

The colonists ate in silence, their faces grim and serious as they worked away at the food. Nora watched them eat, wondering what kind of life these people lived. She wondered if any of them knew how lucky they were to be alive.

She was about to ask someone when the door opened and a man walked into the room. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and muscular, with short black hair and dark brown skin. His face was handsome and rugged, his eyes a piercing blue.

Nora stared at him in shock. The man's clothes were different from those worn by the other colonists. Instead of the utilitarian garments, he wore a long, flowing robe made of rich, soft fabric. It draped over one shoulder and trailed behind him as he moved.

The man stopped near the center of the room and turned toward Nora. She saw a faint smile on his lips, but it didn't reach his eyes.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm Captain James.""

Nora stood up and bowed her head. ""My name is Nora Decker. I'm the colony's best engineer. I was just heading for breakfast.""

Captain James nodded. ""I know. You're the one who fixed the power plant last night.""

Nora felt herself blush and looked down at her feet. She hadn't realized anyone had noticed her work.

""Thank you, Nora. That was very helpful. I'll be sure to let everyone know what a great job you did.""

Nora nodded and sat back down. Her stomach growled loudly, reminding her of the food she'd skipped earlier.

James smiled again. ""You can eat with us if you like. We have plenty of room.""

Nora hesitated, then shook her head. ""No thank you. I'll get something later.""

The captain nodded and turned away. Nora watched him walk out the door, wondering why he was dressed so differently from the other colonists.

She ate her breakfast in silence, watching the people around her as they talked and laughed. She wondered how long it would take before someone asked about the strange man who had come into the cafeteria.

Nora finished eating and left the room without saying goodbye to anyone else.

She passed several colonists on her way, but they gave her only cursory glances. They knew better than to stare at the tall, lean woman with dark hair and green eyes.

Nora was one of the colony's best engineers. She had been recruited from Earth when the Company sent out its first wave of prospectors to find new planets to colonize. Nora had been among the first to arrive, and her skills as an engineer made her invaluable. But her presence also drew attention.

Nora didn't mind. She was used to it. Her mother had warned her about the dangers of being different. Nora had never understood why people would be so afraid of someone who looked like her.

But now, she wished that her mother hadn't told her anything. She'd just wanted her daughter to fit in with the other kids. To have friends.

Nora pushed open the door to the mess hall and stepped inside. The room was large, filled with tables and chairs arranged around a central counter. A few colonists sat at the tables, eating their breakfasts or talking quietly to each other. Nora spotted Sully at one of the tables, sitting alone and reading a book.

She walked over to him. ""Good morning.""

Sully looked up from his book. He smiled at her. ""Morning, Nora. You're late. I thought you were going to get breakfast before work?""

""I was,"" she said. ""But then I remembered how much I hate working on the ship.""

He laughed. ""You don't have to like it, but you do need to keep your job. And if you want to eat, you'll have to hurry.""

Nora nodded and headed for one of the tables. She took a seat across from Sully, who was already digging into his food.

The colonists ate quickly and efficiently. They didn't linger over their meals. Instead, they grabbed a quick bite and rushed out of the mess hall. Nora watched them go with a sigh. It wasn't that she disliked her fellow colonists. She just wished they'd stop treating her like an outsider.

Nora finished her meal and stood up. ""Thanks, Sully. See you later.""

""See you,"" he replied.

She left the mess hall and walked down the corridor toward her work area. The corridors were narrow, barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. Nora had to duck under low ceilings or squeeze between walls.

As she passed the hydroponic greenhouses, she paused at a window to look inside. She could see rows of plants growing in nutrient tanks, their leaves shimmering with moisture.

Nora turned away from the window and continued walking. She reached a door marked ""Engineering."" Inside, she found a long room filled with machinery and equipment. A few colonists worked here, but most of the space was empty.

Nora stepped into the room and looked around.

81,0.2,0.6,1.0,91.0,3,45.0,"The dormitory hallways were quiet as she passed them, but Nora could hear voices coming from the communal showers at the end of each hallway. The colonists'baths were shared by everyone in the colony, so they had to be cleaned regularly. The sounds of water splashing echoed through the halls.

Nora walked past the first few rows of rooms, then turned left to reach the communal bathrooms. She paused outside the door to the showers, listening for a moment. No one else was in there.

She opened the door and stepped inside. A row of stalls lined the wall opposite the entrance. Nora saw that the stall doors were open, revealing empty toilet seats. The showerheads hung above the sinks on either side of the room.

Nora glanced around the bathroom. It was small and utilitarian, with a single large showerhead in the center of the ceiling. The walls were white tile, the floor black rubberized matting. There was no soap or shampoo, but the water pressure was strong enough to wash away dirt and grime.

Nora stepped into the shower, letting the hot water cascade over her body. She sighed as it washed away the last vestiges of sleep. Her muscles ached from the long night of work, but she felt better after washing off the sweat and dust.

The water ran cold for a moment before warming up again. Nora leaned back against the tiled wall, enjoying the sensation of the warm spray on her skin. She closed her eyes and let the water run down her face, neck, and chest. The coolness was a welcome relief.

Nora heard footsteps approaching from behind. She turned to see a young man standing in the doorway, his dark hair wet and slicked back. He wore a pair of faded jeans and a loose shirt that clung to his broad shoulders. His feet were bare.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""You're early.""

He smiled at her, flashing white teeth. ""I'm not late. I just wanted to get a jump on things. You know how it is.""

Nora nodded. She knew. She'd been here for three years now, and the colony was still struggling to make ends meet. The Company had sent them supplies, but they were always running low. And the colonists' equipment broke down more often than it worked.

The young man stepped into the shower with her. He reached out and touched the back of her hand. Nora jerked away, startled by his touch. She stared at him for a moment, then looked down at her hands. They were shaking.

She took a deep breath. ""Sorry,"" she said. ""It's just... you're so different from everyone else. It makes me nervous sometimes.""

He shrugged. ""I understand. I don't mean to scare you.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, it's okay. Really. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.""

He smiled again. ""I'm not offended. I've seen people react like that before. You're new here, right?""

""Yeah. Just got here.""

""Welcome to Presley's Promise,"" he said. ""My name is Sam."" He held out his hand, and Nora clasped it firmly.

Nora nodded. ""I'm Nora.""

Sam smiled at her. ""Nice to meet you, Nora. I'll see you later.""

He stepped out of the shower and shut off the water.

82,0.2,0.6,1.0,95.0,5,46.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty, but the communal showers at the end of each hallway were occupied by colonists waiting their turn. The long rows of single rooms lined the halls, each room containing a bed, desk, chair, and small closet.

She passed through the first few doors, noting the lack of personal items in the closets. Most people didn't own much, so they stored it in the communal storage units. Nora's eyes lingered on the last door, where she saw her roommate's name.

Nora stopped short, then turned back to the door. Her roommate was gone.

Nora frowned. She'd been up late working on repairs, and her roommate had left without saying goodbye. Nora wasn't sure what to think about that.

Nora shrugged off the unease. She knew her roommate wouldn't be happy if she woke her up, but Nora needed to get moving. She headed for the showers.

The communal shower area was a large open space with several rows of stalls and a central drain in the middle. The floor was made of thick metal grating, which gave the place an industrial feel. A row of overhead lights cast harsh shadows across the walls and ceiling.

Nora stepped into the nearest stall and closed the door behind her, then stripped out of her clothes. She set them aside on a bench along one wall before stepping under the hot water.

The showerhead was a long tube attached to the wall above her head, and she aimed it at herself. The water was warm, but not too hot. It felt good on her skin after the cold night air. Nora scrubbed her face and hair vigorously until her scalp tingled.

She rinsed off, then turned off the water and stepped out of the stall. Nora dried herself with a towel from the rack beside the door, then pulled on her clean shirt. She wrapped the towel around her waist and walked back to her room.

Nora opened the door and found her roommate's bed empty. She frowned. Her roommate had left without saying goodbye. Nora wasn't sure what to think about that.

83,0.2,0.6,1.0,87.0,3,48.0,"The hallway outside her room was empty. The dormitories were quiet, too. She passed a few colonists in the hallways, but none of them acknowledged her. They walked briskly, their eyes focused on the ground as they hurried to get somewhere else.

Nora was used to this. Her people were always busy. But she couldn't help feeling like the colony was falling apart around her.

She made her way through the halls, passing the engineering bays where technicians worked to fix the equipment. Most of the techs were already gone, leaving only a skeleton crew behind.

Nora paused at the door to one of the labs. She glanced inside and saw that it was empty. A sign on the door read, ""Chen Lab.""

The director's office was just down the hall from the lab. Nora hesitated for a moment, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.

Director Rowena Chen sat in her chair, staring at a computer screen with an expression of intense concentration. She wore a white lab coat over a black dress shirt and trousers. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun, and her face was pale and drawn.

Nora stopped in the doorway. The director didn't look up.

""Good morning,"" Nora said.

Rowena looked up. Her eyes were dark and tired, but her voice was calm. ""Morning, Nora. I'm glad you're here. We need to talk.""

Nora stepped into the room. She closed the door behind her. The director was still sitting in the same position, hands folded on the desk before her.

Nora crossed to stand beside the director's chair and waited.

The director sighed. ""I've been looking at the data from your last test run.""

""Yes?"" Nora asked.

""You were right. It was a mistake to send you out there alone.""

Nora frowned. ""But I did what you told me to do. I got the ship working again, and we made it back safely. You said—""

""I know what I said,"" Rowena interrupted. ""And I meant every word of it. But this is different. This time, you didn't just get the ship running. You found something. Something dangerous.""

Nora's frown deepened. ""What are you talking about? What have I found?""

Rowena leaned back in her chair and stared at Nora. ""We don't know yet. But whatever it is, it's not good.""

Nora felt a chill crawl down her spine. She had to be wrong. ""But I saw the drones. They were dead. There was nothing left of them.""

""That's because they weren't really alive,"" Rowena said. ""They were constructs. Artificial life forms designed to mimic the behavior of real drones.""

Nora shook her head. ""No. I saw their bodies. They looked like... like..."" She trailed off, unable to find the words to describe what she'd seen.

Rowena nodded. ""Like a swarm of insects. Like locusts. But they were more than that. They were intelligent, and they could think for themselves.""

Nora shivered. ""I don't understand. How can you say that?""

""Because I've been studying the data from your last test run,"" Rowena said.

84,0.2,0.6,1.0,86.0,4,43.0,"The corridors were empty, save for a few colonists wandering about in their pajamas. The halls were dimly lit by the faint glow of emergency lights.

Nora walked briskly toward the mess hall, where she could grab a quick meal and then get to work. She passed the dormitories, which were quiet except for snoring. As she neared the mess hall, she heard voices coming from inside.

She paused at the door, listening. A group of people sat around a table, laughing and joking. Nora recognized the voice of the commander.

Nora hesitated outside the door, wondering if she should interrupt them. But the laughter was infectious, and she couldn't help but smile.

The door opened, and Nora saw Valentina Kern sitting across the table from the others. She wore her uniform, which looked freshly pressed despite the fact that it had been worn for days.

Valentina smiled and waved as Nora entered the room. ""Good morning, Nora! Come join us.""

""Morning, Commander,"" Nora said, stepping into the room. She took a seat next to Valentina.

The other colonists turned toward her with smiles. They were a diverse group of men and women, ranging in age from twenty to fifty years old. All were dressed in pajamas or loose clothing. Most were barefoot.

Nora's gaze swept over the faces. She knew most of them by name, but not everyone.

""How are you this morning?"" Valentina asked.

""I'm good, thanks,"" Nora replied.

""You're up early. I thought you'd be sleeping longer.""

Nora shrugged. ""I was tired. It's a long shift, and I didn't want to waste any time.""

""That's understandable,"" Valentina said. ""We've got a lot of work ahead of us today. We'll need your help.""

""Of course, Commander.""

""Let me introduce you around. This is Dr. Jules, our chief medical officer. He'll be helping us out with some of the more complicated repairs.""

""Nice to meet you,"" Nora said, shaking his hand. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

""Nora,"" he replied. ""It's nice to meet you too.""

Nora nodded at the others. ""This is Dr. Lyle, our head engineer. And this is Dr. Raul, our chief scientist. They'll be working with us today.""

""Good morning, Nora,"" the two scientists greeted her.

""And this is Dr. Chen, our director,"" Valentina said. ""She'll be leading the research team in the labs.""

""Hello, everyone,"" Nora said. She shook hands with each person in turn.

The colonists introduced themselves one after another. The group was diverse. Some were young, while others were middle aged. A few had children.

Nora noticed that most of them wore their hair short or shaved bald.

""So what do we have planned for today?"" Dr. Jules asked. ""I'm sure there's a lot of work to be done.""

Valentina smiled. ""We're going to start with the power plant. We've got some serious problems, so I want to get it fixed before anything else.""

""Sounds good,"" Nora said. ""What about the other buildings? Are they ready?""

85,0.2,0.6,1.0,100.0,5,43.0,"The corridors were empty except for a few colonists moving about their business. The colony's power plant was quiet, but the garage bay doors stood open to let in the morning breeze. A small group of colonists sat around a table playing cards.

Nora walked past them, heading for the cafeteria. Her boots clacked on the metal grating as she passed through the concourse. She paused at the door to the cafeteria, peering inside.

The room was packed with people eating breakfast. Nora stepped inside and found herself in a sea of bodies. She squeezed her way to the front of the line, where the serving robot waited.

""Good morning,"" the machine said. ""How may I serve you?""

Nora looked up at the machine, which resembled a large, metallic insectoid. Its head swiveled back and forth as it scanned the crowd. It had a long, thin body that tapered into a pair of jointed legs ending in three-toed feet.

""I'm looking for breakfast."" Nora spoke slowly and clearly, trying not to slur her words. She didn't want the robot to think she was drunk or stoned.

The robot's eyes glowed red, reflecting the light from its overhead lamps. The lights were dimmed for privacy, but they still cast a harsh glare across the room. Nora squinted as she tried to see the robot's face.

""Breakfast is served,"" the robot announced. ""Please follow me.""

Nora followed the robot through the crowded cafeteria. She watched the other colonists as they ate. Most of them wore the same utilitarian clothing Nora did, though some had added a few more layers. A few wore the Company logo on their jackets.

The robot led her to a table in the corner. Nora sat down and waited for the food to arrive.

""Thank you,"" the robot said as it placed two plates of eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit in front of Nora. The robot then turned and walked away without another word.

Nora stared at the food. She picked up a fork and poked at the scrambled eggs. They were cold. She sighed.

She'd been awake for hours. But she couldn't afford to sleep any longer. Not if she wanted to keep her job.

Nora ate the eggs, which tasted like rubber. She pushed the plate aside.

The colony was built on a rocky plateau overlooking a vast desert. The sun had set behind the horizon, leaving only a faint glow of light above the distant mountains. Nora stood and stretched, working out the kinks in her back. She looked around.

A few colonists were still awake, but most of them had already finished eating. Nora headed for the garage bay doors.

The air outside was cool and fresh. Nora pulled her jacket tighter as she walked along the concourse toward the power plant. Her boots clacked loudly on the metal grating.

The power plant was a large, squat building with a single door at its base. Nora walked inside and found herself in an enormous room filled with equipment and machinery.

86,0.2,0.6,1.0,91.0,3,44.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by a few emergency lights, but she could see well enough to navigate without bumping into anything. The air smelled stale and dry, like dust and rust. She passed the dormitories, where colonists slept in their beds, and continued on toward the mess hall.

She paused at the entrance to the cafeteria, looking around for familiar faces. Most of the colonists were already there, eating breakfast and chatting quietly among themselves. A few glanced up from their meals as she entered, but no one spoke to her.

Nora took a seat near the back, next to the wall. She ordered a bowl of cereal and a glass of water, then dug into her meal while she waited for it to arrive.

A few minutes later, a young man with dark hair and eyes approached Nora's table. He was tall and lean, wearing a loose black shirt over a pair of faded jeans. His face was angular and handsome, and his smile was warm and friendly.

""Hey, Nora,"" he said. ""I'm Tom.""

Nora nodded in greeting. ""Tom. I'm new here. What do you do?""

He shrugged. ""I'm an engineer. I work on the farms and in the hydroponic greenhouses. You?""

""Administrator. Sully Carmichael is my boss.""

""Oh, yeah. I've heard about him. He's a good guy. How long have you been here?""

Nora hesitated. She didn't want to talk about herself, but she couldn't help it. ""About six months.""

""Wow. That's a long time. You must be pretty tired of this place. It gets old after a while, doesn't it? But hey, at least you get paid for it.""

Nora smiled wryly. ""Yeah. At least I get paid.""

Tom laughed. ""You're not kidding. I hear the Company's a real piece of work.""

""It can be.""

""I guess it has its perks. Hey, I'm sorry I haven't introduced myself yet. My name's Tom.""

Nora shook his hand. ""Nice to meet you. I'm Nora. Nice to meet you too.""

Tom nodded and sat down across from her. He glanced around the cafeteria, then leaned in close. ""So what do you think of our little colony so far?""

Nora shrugged. ""I don't know much about it. I've only been here for a few months.""

""Well, we're pretty isolated out here. We're on the edge of settled space. The nearest city is over two hundred light years away. And there's nothing else for hundreds of miles.""

Nora frowned. ""What are you talking about? There's got to be something else out here. Why would anyone live out here?""

""The Company owns this planet. They built the colony. They own everything here."" Tom paused, then added, ""And they're not very nice people.""

""Why not?""

Tom sighed. ""They've been trying to get rid of us for a long time. But we keep coming back."" He looked at Nora. ""You know why? Because we have nowhere else to go.""

Nora nodded slowly. ""I guess so.""

Tom leaned closer, lowering his voice. ""Listen, I know you're new here and you probably don't know anything about the Company. But trust me, it's not worth your life. They'll kill you if they can.""

87,0.2,0.6,1.0,83.0,3,41.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by flickering lights embedded in the walls. The air smelled stale and musty, like a basement. Nora walked past rows of doors to find the mess hall.

The mess hall was a long room filled with tables and chairs. A few colonists sat at the tables, eating and talking quietly. Others stood around the room, waiting their turn to eat. Nora took a seat at one of the empty tables. She was hungry enough that she didn't mind waiting for her food.

A young man with dark hair and brown eyes approached her table. He wore a white uniform with a black tie, but his sleeves were rolled up to reveal muscular forearms. Nora recognized him as the colony's chief engineer, Jules.

""Good morning,"" he said with a smile. ""I'm sorry I overslept.""

Nora nodded. ""It's okay. You're not the only one who needed it. How are you feeling?""

Jules shrugged. ""Fine. Just a little tired. We've been working hard, and we haven't had much sleep lately. But I'll be fine. It's just a matter of getting used to the schedule again.""

Nora smiled back. ""You'll get there. I know how tough this is for everyone.""

He nodded, then turned to look at the other colonists. ""Okay, everybody! Breakfast is served!""

The colonists began filing into the mess hall. Nora followed them in and took a seat near the front. The room was filled with a low murmur of conversation and clinking utensils.

A young woman with blonde hair and blue eyes sat down across from Nora. She wore a white lab coat over a long sleeved shirt, which was tucked into her pants. Her name tag read Dr. Kaitlin.

""Good morning,"" Nora said to her. ""I'm Nora.""

Kaitlin nodded. ""Nice to meet you, Nora. I'm Kaitlin.""

Nora smiled at the doctor. ""How are you feeling?""

Kaitlin shrugged. ""Tired. But I'll be fine.""

Nora nodded. ""We're all tired. We've been working hard. And we haven't had much sleep lately.""

""Yeah,"" Kaitlin said with a sigh. ""I know what you mean. I'm just glad to have my shift off today. It's going to take me awhile to get used to the schedule again.""

Nora nodded. ""It'll get easier. You'll see. Everyone will.""

Kaitlin smiled. ""Thanks, Nora. That means a lot to hear. I'll be here if you need anything.""

Nora waved and turned back to her food. She ate quickly, then stood up. ""I should go check on the equipment.""

Kaitlin nodded. ""Good idea. See you later, Nora.""

Nora left the mess hall and walked down the corridor toward engineering. The corridors were dimly lit with flickering lights embedded in the walls. Nora passed rows of doors to find the engineering bays.

The engineering bay was a large room filled with workstations and machinery. A few colonists worked at their stations, but most sat around talking quietly or reading books.

Nora found her way to the power plant. She stepped into a small office next to it.

She walked briskly down the hallway, past the dormitories, toward the cafeteria. As she approached, the smell of fresh coffee wafted from the kitchen. Nora slowed her pace to savor the aroma, then continued on at a more leisurely pace.

The cafeteria was a large open space with long tables and benches. It had been designed to accommodate the entire colony, but the tables were rarely full. Most colonists preferred to eat their meals in the privacy of their rooms.

Nora found a table near the back corner where she could sit alone. She sat down and took a sip of her coffee, which was hot and strong. She sighed as the warmth spread through her body.

The cafeteria was quiet except for the occasional clatter of utensils and the murmur of conversation. Nora was grateful that no one else seemed to be awake yet.

She sipped her coffee, enjoying the taste, and watched the other colonists come and go. She noticed a few familiar faces among them, but most were strangers.

A young man with dark hair and eyes came in carrying a tray laden with food. He set it down on the table next to Nora's and smiled at her. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora returned his smile. ""Hi, Ben. How are you?""

""I'm fine,"" he said. ""How about yourself? You look tired. Are you getting enough sleep?""

Nora shrugged. ""It's hard to get used to sleeping in a bed again after being cooped up in the ship for so long.""

Ben nodded. ""You'll get used to it eventually. I know how much you hate the dormitories.""

She laughed. ""Yeah, I guess I will.""

He leaned forward and lowered his voice. ""So what do you think of the colony?""

Nora looked around the room. The cafeteria was filled with colonists, but none were close enough to hear their conversation. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly before answering. ""It's... different. It feels like we're living in a science fiction movie.""

Ben chuckled. ""That's because we are. This is the future, Nora. We've been here for years now, and we still haven't found anything that can help us grow food or make our equipment work better.""

Nora frowned. ""But there must be something! There has to be!""

""There's nothing,"" Ben said. ""We've tried everything. Every resource on this planet is gone. We have no more fuel for the fusion reactor. We don't even have enough water to keep the hydroponic farms alive.""

Nora's frown deepened. ""Then why are you still here?""

Ben shrugged. ""Because we're not alone. We have Eve. She keeps us going.""

Nora nodded. ""I know. I'm just... I wish I could do something to help. If only I had some way of fixing the power plant...""

""You're an engineer,"" Ben said. ""Fix it.""

Nora walked briskly toward the mess hall, where she could grab something quick and get back to her duties. She passed several other colonists on the way, but none acknowledged her. They were too busy to notice.

The colony's power plant was located at the far end of the residential wing. Nora had to pass through the command center to reach it. She glanced up at the dark windows as she approached, wondering if anyone was awake in the control room.

Nora reached the door to the power plant, which was locked. A security panel beside the door flashed red when Nora touched the sensor pad. She tried again, then pressed her thumb to the scanner. The lock disengaged with a click and the door slid open.

Inside, the air was thick with heat and humidity. Nora stepped inside, blinking in the sudden brightness. She squinted into the glare, trying to see the reactor core, but the only thing she could make out was a large metal box.

Nora walked over to the nearest wall and leaned against it, breathing deeply. She felt the sweat on her face evaporate instantly as she exhaled. The air in the power plant was hot, but not unbearably so.

She turned to look at the reactor, but the light from the corridor was too bright. Instead, Nora looked around the room, taking in the details of the space. It was small and utilitarian, like everything else in the colony.

The walls were lined with conduits and cables, which ran along the floor to join up with other lines running through the ceiling. There was a single door in the far corner, which led to the garage.

Nora stepped closer to the door, peering into the darkness beyond. She could hear the faint hum of machinery, and she thought she saw a glimmer of light.

A few steps away, Nora stopped and listened. She heard nothing but her own heartbeat. The power plant was silent except for the hum of machinery.

Nora took a deep breath and stepped into the dark room. She reached out to touch the wall, but her hand passed right through it. She frowned, then touched the wall again, this time with both hands.

The wall was solid. Nora's fingers sank into the metal plates as if they were soft clay. She pulled back, confused. The wall should have been made of some kind of pliable material, not hard steel.

She looked around the room again, but there was no sign of a door or exit. Nora tried to remember how she had gotten in here, but her memory failed her.

Nora turned and walked back toward the door, trying to figure out what was going on. She felt a chill run down her spine. Something wasn't right.

Nora stepped into the corridor and closed the door behind her, locking it with another security panel. She stood in front of the door for several minutes, listening for any sounds from inside.

Nothing. Nora sighed and leaned against the wall. She didn't know where she was supposed to go next. The command center? The garage?

Nora decided to try the garage first.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall, where food was served. Nora walked past the line and found a table near the back corner. She sat down and waited for the automated server to deliver her meal.

A tall, slender woman with dark skin and short black hair approached from behind the counter. She wore a white lab coat over her uniform. Her name tag read Dr. S.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said the doctor. ""I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner. My shift started at six.""

Nora nodded. ""No problem. I've been awake since five. I just got up.""

Dr. S smiled. ""You're a hard worker, aren't you?""

""Yeah. I like my job.""

""That's good. We need more people who enjoy their work.""

Nora shrugged. ""I guess so.""

""Well, if you ever want to quit, let me know. I can always use an engineer with your skills.""

""Thanks. But I don't think I'll leave anytime soon.""

""Good. Then we have a lot to talk about today. How do you feel?""

""Fine.""

""Really? You look tired. Are you sure you're okay?""

""I'm fine. Just a little hungry.""

""Okay. Let's start with some blood tests then. Come this way.""

Nora followed Dr. S through the cafeteria and into a small room where several medical devices were set up on tables. The doctor took out a syringe, filled it with clear liquid from a vial, and injected Nora's arm.

""This will take only a minute,"" said Dr. S. ""Just relax.""

Nora nodded. She felt nothing but a slight prickling sensation at first, but after a few seconds her skin began to tingle. A warm feeling spread throughout her body, and she felt herself relaxing.

""That's odd,"" said the doctor. ""Your pulse is racing.""

""I'm okay?""

""Yes. You're just nervous. That's normal for someone who has never been exposed to an alien environment before.""

""Oh.""

""You'll be fine. Now, let me check your eyes.""

Nora blinked a few times to focus on Dr. S's face. Her green eyes looked back at Nora with concern. ""Are you okay?""

""Yeah.""

Dr. S nodded. ""I'm going to give you a mild sedative now. It'll help you get some rest. You should feel better once it takes effect.""

""Okay.""

Nora closed her eyes and waited for the drug to take hold. She felt a pleasant warmth spreading through her body, and her mind seemed clearer than usual.

""Good,"" said Dr. S. ""Now, let's take a look at those eyes. I want to make sure they're healthy.""

Nora opened her eyes and stared into the doctor's face. The woman was smiling gently. Nora felt calm and relaxed.

""They're fine,"" said Dr. S. ""You'll be fine.""

""Thanks.""

""You're welcome. Now, let me show you around.""

Nora followed Dr. S out of the room.

Nora paused to check the time on her wristwatch. She was early. Her stomach growled at the thought of food. She hurried down the hall toward the mess hall, where she could grab something to eat while waiting for the others to arrive.

She passed several other colonists along the way. Most of them wore similar clothing to Nora's, but some had more colorful outfits that stood out in stark contrast to the drab surroundings. One woman was dressed in a bright red jumpsuit with a white collar, while another man wore a black suit with a silver tie.

Nora glanced up from her watch as she approached the mess hall entrance. She saw a tall, thin figure standing in the doorway. He was wearing a long coat and hat, and his face was hidden by shadow.

""Hey,"" Nora said, stopping short. ""Who are you?""

The stranger didn't answer. Instead, he stepped aside so Nora could enter the building. The door closed behind her with a click.

Nora frowned at the sound. It was too loud. She turned around and looked back out into the corridor, but the stranger wasn't there.

Nora shook her head. She'd been seeing things lately.

She entered the mess hall, which was empty except for one person sitting at a table near the far wall. Nora recognized him immediately.

""Hello, Mr. Decker."" The man's voice was deep and resonant. He stood up and removed his hat, revealing a bald head covered in a thick mat of gray hair. His eyes were dark brown, set under heavy brows.

Nora nodded to the man. ""Good morning, Dr. Taggart.""

The doctor smiled at her. ""You're early today, Nora. I thought you might be hungry.""

""I am,"" Nora replied. She sat down across from him and pulled out a chair. ""But I'm not sure what's for breakfast. Do you know?""

""Not yet,"" the doctor said. He opened his menu and scanned it. ""We'll have to wait until we get our first delivery of supplies. But I can tell you what's on the menu.""

Nora glanced at the menu. It listed a variety of foods, including eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, toast, pancakes, waffles, oatmeal, and cereal.

""That sounds good."" Nora looked up at him. ""What do you recommend?""

The doctor chuckled. ""Well, let's see... I think I'll try the scrambled eggs with ham and cheese.""

""Sounds great,"" Nora said. She reached for her wristwatch. ""I should get going.""

The doctor nodded, then returned to his meal.

Nora stood up. As she walked out of the mess hall, she heard a faint click behind her. She turned around and saw the door closing again.

She frowned. The sound had been too loud.

Nora hurried back down the corridor toward her quarters. Her stomach growled at the thought of food.

The door to her room was closed.

Nora pressed her ear against the metal surface. There was no sound from inside.

92,0.2,0.7,1.0,83.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each one marked with a number. She walked past the first door, then the second, and the third.

The fourth door opened as she approached. A tall man stood in the doorway, dressed in a dark suit. He was lean and muscular, but not overly so. His hair was short and black, his eyes blue and sharp.

Nora stopped, staring at him. ""Commander Kern?""

""Yes."" Valentina's voice was deep and commanding.

Nora swallowed hard. She knew this woman. This was the commander of the colony, the one who had ordered her to fix a malfunctioning airlock.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora said. ""Did I... do something wrong? Did you want me to come back later?""

Valentina shook her head. ""No. You're fine. Come in.""

Nora stepped inside and closed the door behind her. She looked around, trying to get her bearings. The room was small, with a single bed pushed up against one wall and a desk and chair set up along the opposite side. A window was cut into the far wall, overlooking the cliffs and the distant stars beyond.

A few pieces of equipment were scattered about the room, including a computer terminal and several bookshelves. There was no sign of food or drink.

Nora glanced at Valentina. ""Is there anything else I can help you with?""

""Not right now."" Valentina walked over to the window, looking out. ""I've been waiting for you. The Company sent me here because they think you're the best engineer in the fleet.""

Nora's heart sank. ""They don't know what they're talking about.""

Valentina turned to face her. ""You're a good engineer. You're smart and resourceful. You're also stubborn and independent.""

""I'm not an engineer,"" Nora said.

Valentina smiled. ""But you are a mechanic. And I need someone who knows how to fix things.""

Nora stared at her. ""What do you mean?""

""The Company has some... issues with our power plant. We're having trouble keeping it running."" Valentina gestured toward the window, where the foggy morning light glinted off a nearby rock formation. ""We have a problem with one of the reactors. It's overheating and we can't get it to cool down.""

Nora frowned. ""That sounds like a mechanical issue.""

Valentina nodded. ""It is. But the Company wants us to solve it. They want you to come up with a solution.""

Nora felt her stomach drop. ""Me? I'm just a mechanic.""

""Yes, but you're the best mechanic in the fleet,"" Valentina said. ""And if anyone can figure out what's wrong with this reactor, it'll be you.""

""But..."" Nora looked at the floor. ""I don't know anything about nuclear engineering.""

Valentina smiled again. ""You'll learn.""

Nora shook her head. ""No. I won't.""

""Look, you're the only one who can fix it. The Company needs you."" Valentina stepped closer to Nora and lowered her voice. ""I've been here for a few weeks now. I know what it's like. You have to keep going.

93,0.2,0.7,1.0,91.0,3,45.0,"The colony's main hall was dimly lit by emergency lights, but the corridor was well-lit by a row of overhead lamps. The air smelled faintly of ozone.

Nora walked briskly toward the dining area in the center of the colony. She passed several colonists heading in the opposite direction, each one wearing their own version of a uniform. Most wore the same type of clothing Nora did, though the colors were different. Some wore dark blue coveralls with the Company logo on the chest pocket. Others wore gray jumpsuits with the Company logo embroidered on the left breast.

Nora paused at the entrance to the dining room. She looked around, taking in the scene. A few colonists sat at tables, eating from trays. They glanced up as Nora approached, then returned to their meals.

The dining room was large, with long rows of tables and chairs. The walls were lined with windows that overlooked the landscape outside. Nora could see a small lake and a rocky outcropping beyond the glass.

A tall, thin man in a black suit stood near the door, watching her approach. He had short brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His eyes were pale green and sharp.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""You're late.""

Nora nodded. ""I'm sorry, sir. I overslept.""

The man frowned. ""We don't have time for this. Get your tray and get back to work. You'll be busy today, so you won't need breakfast.""

Nora's stomach rumbled. She was hungry. But her shift started in half an hour.

She sighed. ""Yes, sir.""

He turned away without another word. Nora walked over to a table where two other colonists sat. They were both men in their early twenties. One wore a dark blue uniform, while the other wore gray. Both looked up as Nora approached.

""Morning,"" Nora said.

The man in gray nodded. ""Hi.""

""What are you doing here?"" the man in blue asked.

Nora shrugged. ""I was going to ask you the same thing.""

""Same answer,"" the man in gray said. ""We're on standby. We're supposed to stay here until we're needed.""

""For what?""

The man in gray shook his head. ""I don't know. I've been here since yesterday.""

Nora looked around. The dining hall was nearly empty. Most colonists were already at their jobs.

""Do you think it's aliens?"" Nora asked.

The man in blue nodded. ""I do.""

""Why?""

""Because they're not human,"" the man said. ""They don't act like humans, and they don't talk like humans. And they definitely aren't from Earth.""

Nora frowned. ""How can you tell?""

""It's obvious,"" the man in blue said. ""Look at them.""

Nora looked. She saw a tall woman with long black hair wearing a dark blue jumpsuit. A short man in a gray uniform stood next to her.

""What about them?"" Nora asked.

""They're too polite,"" the man said. ""Humans are always rude.""

Nora nodded. ""That's true.""

""And look how they dress,"" the man in blue added. ""Humans wear clothes. Aliens don't.""

Nora looked again. The aliens wore loose clothing made of thin fabric. It hung loosely on their bodies, but didn't seem to be designed for any specific purpose.

""What do you think they're doing here?"" Nora asked.

The man shrugged.

94,0.2,0.7,1.0,68.0,7,42.0,"The colony's central power plant hummed along in the background like a giant engine. The air was cold, but not uncomfortably so. Nora walked past the dormitories to the command center where she could access the main concourse.

The colonists' living spaces were arranged around the central concourse, which connected the command center, laboratories, greenhouses, and power plant. Nora passed through the large, open space, which was filled with people working, eating, exercising, or relaxing. She made her way to the cafeteria at the far end of the concourse.

She entered the cafeteria, which was packed with people. Nora took a seat at one of the long tables, where she found her usual place. A few minutes later, the automated food dispenser delivered a tray of steaming hot coffee, a bowl of oatmeal, a plate of eggs, and a small loaf of bread.

Nora dug into her breakfast, which tasted wonderful after a night of sleep. She ate quickly, then washed it down with more coffee.

After finishing, Nora stood up and stretched. Her muscles ached from the hard work she'd done yesterday, but she felt better than when she woke.

""Good morning,"" Nora said to the room. ""I'm glad you're all awake.""

A chorus of greetings greeted Nora's words, and she smiled in response. The colonists were a friendly bunch who enjoyed each other's company. They had no idea what they were getting into.

Nora walked out of the cafeteria and headed for the laboratories, where she would begin her shift. She passed through the command center, which was filled with Company executives monitoring their colony. Nora knew most of them by name, but she didn't know any of the faces behind the screens.

The corridors leading to the laboratories were dimly lit and empty. Nora stepped inside, shut the door, and locked it.

She turned on the lights and began setting up her tools.

Nora worked alone, which suited her just fine. She preferred working alone anyway. It gave her more time to think about the problems she faced.

Nora was an engineer. She specialized in troubleshooting and repairing equipment. Her job wasn't glamorous, but it paid well. Nora liked the challenge of solving complex technical problems.

Her workstation consisted of a large table with a flat surface, several chairs, and a small desk. A computer monitor sat on the desk. On the wall beside the desk hung a map of the colony. Nora's workspace was in one of the labs, which were located at the far end of the concourse.

Nora set up her tools and began checking the diagnostics of the colony's power plant. She checked the fusion reactor, the automated systems, and the communications network.

The colonists' advanced technology was impressive, but it also broke down often enough to show it. Nora spent hours each day fixing the equipment. Her job required her to be creative and resourceful.

Nora had been working on the problem for nearly two days when she heard the sound of footsteps approaching from outside. She looked up and saw a man enter the lab.

""Hello,"" he said. ""I'm Sully Carmichael.""

Nora stood and extended her hand. ""Nice to meet you, Mr. Carmichael.""

Sully shook Nora's hand. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man with a friendly smile and a warm handshake.

95,0.2,0.7,1.0,79.0,3,46.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty. The colonists had already left for work. Nora passed a few other people, but none stopped to talk. She was alone in the hallway.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, where she could grab something quick and get back to work. Her boots clomped on the metal flooring as she strode along the corridor. A few paces later, the sound of her boots changed to a soft padding that echoed off the walls.

Nora froze.

She heard the footsteps again. They came from behind her.

Nora turned around slowly, trying to see through the dimness. She couldn't tell what was making those sounds.

The footsteps drew closer.

Nora's heart pounded in her chest as she backed up. She felt like a trapped animal.

A hand gripped her shoulder. Nora gasped and spun around, ready to fight. But the person who grabbed her wasn't human.

The creature was tall, with a lean build and dark skin. Its face was covered in thick black fur and its eyes were large and round. It wore a long, loose robe of some kind of fabric. The garment hung loosely over the creature's shoulders and trailed down to the floor.

Nora stared at it in shock. She'd never seen anything like this before.

The creature looked back at her, then let go of Nora's shoulder. It stepped forward into the dim light of the hallway. Nora took a step backward.

""Hello,"" said the creature. ""I am Dr. Zafir.""

Nora blinked. She didn't know what to say. Her mind raced for something intelligent to say.

Dr. Zafir smiled. ""You are very quiet. I can understand that. You must be new here.""

Nora nodded.

""My name is Nora Decker. I'm an engineer.""

""Yes, I see. And you're new to the colony?""

""That's right. I just arrived yesterday.""

""Ah, yes. The Company sent you out here, did they? Well, welcome to Presley's Promise. We have been waiting for you.""

Nora frowned. ""Waiting for me?""

""Yes. We've been expecting you.""

""Expecting me... for what?""

""For a long time now. For many years. The Company has been waiting for someone like you. Someone who could help us.""

Nora stared at the creature in confusion. ""Help you how?""

""We need your expertise, Nora. Your engineering skills. You will work with me.""

Nora's eyes widened. She shook her head. ""No. No, I don't want to do that.""

Dr. Zafir smiled again. ""You won't have a choice. You'll be working for me.""

Nora felt like screaming. Instead, she turned around and ran back down the hallway toward her quarters.

She slammed into the door to her room and threw it open. Her bed was empty.

The creature from the hall stood outside Nora's door, watching her run away. It raised one hand and waved at her. ""Goodbye, Nora.""

Nora stopped running. She looked back over her shoulder. The creature had vanished.

Nora stared at the closed door for a moment before turning around.

96,0.2,0.7,1.0,81.0,4,43.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by the same distant starlight that illuminated the landscape outside. The air smelled faintly of ozone and dust, but otherwise seemed fresh. A few colonists walked past her, their faces obscured in shadow.

The colony's communal dining area was a long, narrow room with tables set up along the walls. At one end, a large window looked out over the rocky terrain. Nora passed through the room and headed for the kitchen at the far end of the hall.

She found the kitchen bustling with activity. Several people worked together to prepare food. Nora paused to watch them work, taking note of the way they moved and the efficiency with which they worked. She was impressed.

Nora entered the kitchen, where a woman in a white lab coat stood behind the counter. Her hair was short, dark brown, and cut close to her head. She wore thick glasses and had a small nose and chin. Nora guessed that the woman must be Director Chen.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said the director. ""I trust you slept well?""

""Yes, ma'am.""

Director Chen smiled. ""You're looking good this morning. I'm glad to see it. You've been working hard lately. We need your help. Now, let's get started. Breakfast is ready. Come with me.""

Nora followed the director into a large, brightly lit room. The walls were lined with shelves holding rows of glass jars filled with various liquids. A few other colonists sat around tables eating breakfast.

The director led Nora to one of the tables. She took a seat and waited while the director served her.

Nora stared at the food on her plate. It looked like some kind of processed meat. She wrinkled her nose in disgust.

""What's wrong, Nora?"" asked Director Chen. ""Don't tell me you don't eat meat. I know for a fact that you do. You're not squeamish about it, are you?""

Nora shook her head. ""No, ma'am.""

""Good. Then you'll be fine with this."" Director Chen picked up a fork and speared a chunk of the gray meat. She held it out to Nora. ""Try it.""

Nora hesitated, then reached for the fork. She bit into the gray meat with a crunch. It was tough, but tasted like beef jerky.

Director Chen watched Nora chew. ""It's good,"" she said. ""I'm glad to see you're willing to try new things. Now, let's get back to work.""

Nora swallowed the last bite of the gray meat and washed it down with a swig from her water bottle. She followed the director back through the kitchen.

Nora found herself working alongside several other colonists in an area where they were assembling parts for various pieces of equipment. The colonists worked together efficiently, their hands moving quickly over the components. Nora took note of how well they coordinated.

She glanced around at the others. They were all young men and women, most of them in their twenties or thirties. Most of them wore utility pants and shirts like Nora's. Some had jackets. All of them wore boots.

Nora felt a pang of envy. She wanted to be one of those people. She wanted to have the confidence and the self-assurance that came with being able to wear clothes like theirs. But she knew it wasn't possible.

97,0.2,0.7,1.0,72.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few lights set high up in the walls, but she could see well enough to navigate without tripping over anything. The colony's layout was simple and straightforward, with hallways running perpendicular to each other at right angles. Each hallway had a single door on either side of it.

Nora walked briskly down the main concourse, past the command center where the Company executives lived, and toward the cafeteria. She passed the dormitories and the laboratories. At the end of the long corridor was the power plant.

The cafeteria was a large open space with tables and chairs arranged in rows. Nora entered the cafeteria, which was filled with colonists eating breakfast. She spotted her friend, Dr. Chen, sitting alone at one of the tables near the back. Nora waved to get her attention.

Dr. Chen looked up from her meal and smiled. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning, Rowena,"" Nora said. She sat down across from the older woman. ""How are you?""

Rowena shrugged. ""I'm fine. How about yourself? You look tired.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, I am. But it's not like we have any choice. We're stuck here until they can fix our equipment.""

""You'll be glad to know the Company is working on it. They've sent a repair team to check out the problem.""

""That's good news, but..."" Nora trailed off. She didn't want to say what she was thinking.

""But?""

Nora sighed. ""It'll take time. It could be days before they send another ship for us.""

""Days?"" Rowena asked. Her eyes narrowed. ""What do you mean, 'days'? What's going on?""

Nora shook her head. ""I don't know. I just... I think something bad happened.""

""Something bad? What do you mean?""

""I don't know,"" Nora repeated. ""I just feel it. Something bad is coming. And when it comes, there won't be anything we can do about it.""

Rowena stared at Nora. ""Are you sure?""

Nora nodded. ""I'm sure.""

""Then let's go find out what it is.""

""Okay.""

The two women stood up from their seats and walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Rowena called after them. ""I'll come with you.""

Nora stopped and looked back at her friend. ""Why?""

Rowena shrugged. ""Because I'm your friend. Because we need to talk.""

Nora nodded. ""All right."" She turned around and started walking again.

They left the cafeteria and headed down a long hallway toward the engineering bays. The floor was covered with grating metal, which made it difficult for Nora to walk without tripping over something.

""This is ridiculous,"" Nora said. ""We should have brought our boots.""

""You can't wear boots here,"" Rowena replied. ""It's too cold.""

Nora frowned. ""I know that. But I don't like it.""

""Well, you're not going to get any warmer if you keep complaining about it.""

Nora walked down the hall to the communal kitchen. She passed a few colonists already awake, chatting quietly as they ate their breakfasts. They glanced up at her briefly before returning to their conversations.

The kitchen was small, cramped, and utilitarian. A long table ran down the center of the space, flanked on either side by rows of counters. Shelves along the wall held pots and pans, utensils, and other cooking supplies.

Nora grabbed a tray from the countertop and filled it with food items. She took her breakfast out of the refrigerator, then headed for the door.

She paused in the doorway, glancing back at the table. The colonists had finished eating and were now talking among themselves. Nora turned away to leave, but stopped when one of the men called out to her.

""Hey, Nora!"" he said. ""You're up early.""

Nora looked over her shoulder and saw him standing near the table. He was a tall man with dark hair, wearing a loose shirt and pants. His face was tanned and weathered, but his eyes were bright blue.

""Yeah,"" Nora replied. ""I'm just heading to work.""

He nodded. ""Good luck today.""

Nora smiled and waved, then left the kitchen. She walked down the hall toward the elevator, which was already waiting for her.

The elevator doors opened onto the main floor of the colony. The space was large and open, with a high ceiling supported by metal beams and pillars. A wide walkway ran around the perimeter, and the walls were lined with windows overlooking the landscape beyond.

Nora stepped off the elevator and headed for the command center. She passed a few colonists on her way there, but they didn't acknowledge her.

She entered the building through an unmarked door at the end of the corridor. The command center was a single room with a vaulted ceiling and a long table running down its length. At the far end, a bank of monitors displayed images from various cameras scattered throughout the colony.

Nora walked to the front of the room and sat in one of the chairs. A large screen mounted above the table showed a view of the surrounding landscape. Nora glanced up at it, then turned her attention back to the screens.

A map of the colony appeared on the first monitor. It was divided into quadrants, each labeled with the name of a different section. The map was overlaid with a grid of red lines and circles indicating where drones had been detected.

Nora leaned forward, studying the display intently. She knew every inch of the colony, and the layout was familiar. But the map wasn't showing her anything new.

She frowned, glancing over her shoulder. She saw a man standing near the door, watching her. He was tall and lean with dark hair and eyes. His face was tanned and weathered, but his eyes were bright blue.

""Hey,"" he said. ""You're up early.""

Nora looked at him again. ""Yeah.

She walked to the cafeteria where she found it empty except for one man sitting at the counter. He was tall, thin, and wore a dark suit. His hair was black and slicked back from his face. A small scar marred his left cheekbone.

Nora approached him cautiously. ""Good morning,"" she said.

He looked up with a smile. ""Morning, Nora.""

""You're new here?""

""Yes.""

""I'm the engineer. I'll be your supervisor today. My name is Rafe. What's yours?""

""Nora. Nora Decker.""

Rafe nodded. ""Well, Nora, you'll need to get started on your duties. We've got a lot of work ahead of us.""

""What do we have to do first?""

""First, we'll go over the schedule for the day. Then, we'll start with some maintenance tasks. You'll see what I mean when you look around. There are a few things that need fixing. The power grid, the water system, the heating and cooling systems. And there's the matter of the drones. They're not responding properly. It seems they don't like being underground.""

Nora frowned. ""Drones? What kind of drones?""

""They're automated sentries. They patrol the perimeter of the colony, keeping watch for threats.""

""Like aliens?""

Rafe nodded. ""That's right. But the problem is, the drones aren't working. They're malfunctioning.""

Nora looked at him in confusion. ""How can they malfunction if they're robots?""

""I'm sure it's just a glitch,"" Rafe said. He pointed to the wall behind her. ""We'll need to fix those lights.""

Nora turned back toward the wall, but instead of seeing the dimly lit hallways, she saw the dark tunnels leading into the hive. She gasped and stumbled backward.

""What is it?"" Rafe asked.

She shook her head. ""Nothing. I thought I saw something move down there.""

Rafe nodded. ""I'll take a look later. For now, let's get started on your duties.""

Nora followed him through the cafeteria and out of the building. The sun was rising over the horizon. The sky was clear and blue, but the air felt cold.

Nora shivered. ""It's going to be another hot day.""

""Yes,"" Rafe agreed. ""But we'll have plenty of time for work after breakfast.""

Nora nodded, but didn't feel much better about it. She'd been up since before dawn. Her body ached from lack of sleep, and her stomach growled with hunger.

The colony's dining hall was a large room filled with long tables where colonists ate their meals. It had no windows, so the only light came from flickering lamps set into the walls.

Nora sat at one of the tables and waited for Rafe to join her. She glanced around, but most of the other colonists were already seated.

Nora headed for the kitchen where she found Sully already at work. He wore a white lab coat over his uniform, and he was bent over the stove, stirring something in a pot. His back was to Nora as she entered, so she paused to watch him for a moment.

Sully was tall and lean with dark hair that fell just past his shoulders. A scar ran along the left side of his face, and his eyes were dark brown. He had a strong jawline and a square chin.

Nora liked watching him cook because it made her feel like she was part of the crew. She could see herself in his future.

She cleared her throat. ""Hey, Sully.""

He turned around to look at her. ""Morning, Nora.""

""I'm going to grab some breakfast,"" she said. ""Want anything?""

""No thanks."" He returned to stirring the contents of the pot.

Nora nodded and walked away. She didn't want to be alone with her thoughts.

The kitchen was small, but well equipped. The walls were lined with cabinets and shelves holding supplies. There was a long countertop with stools on either side. A large sink was set into one wall, and the other held a table and chairs.

A few colonists sat at the tables eating their breakfasts. They glanced up as Nora entered, but no one spoke to her.

Nora grabbed a tray from a nearby shelf and filled it with eggs, bacon, toast, and orange juice. She carried the food over to Sully's station and put it down on the counter.

Sully looked up. ""Thanks.""

""You're welcome."" Nora turned back toward the door. ""See you later.""

She left the kitchen and headed for the garage where she found her workstation already occupied. A young woman sat at the computer, typing furiously. She wore a white lab coat and had short brown hair. Her eyes were dark brown and her skin was pale.

Nora smiled at the girl. ""Good morning, Tanya.""

Tanya looked up. She was pretty with a delicate face and a slender build. Nora liked how her clothes fit her.

""Morning, Nora,"" Tanya said.

""How are things?""

""Same as yesterday. I'm trying to get this power loader working again. It's been acting up since we got here. We've only had it three days, but it's already broken twice.""

Nora nodded. ""I'll take a look at it when I have time.""

She turned to leave, but Tanya called out after her. ""Hey, Nora? How do you know so much about the colony?""

""What do you mean?""

""Well..."" Tanya hesitated. ""You're the best engineer on the crew. You must be really smart.""

""Not really. Just good at my job.""

Tanya shrugged. ""Anyway, you seem like a nice person. And you don't talk much. So I thought maybe you could tell me something about the colony.""

Nora paused and looked at Tanya.

101,0.2,0.8,1.0,87.0,5,49.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lighting, but Nora could see well enough to navigate without tripping over anything. The colony's power plant hummed in the background, and she heard the faint sounds of people moving about inside their rooms.

Nora walked briskly through the halls, passing other colonists heading to work. She stopped at the end of the hall to check her watch. Her shift started in ten minutes.

She hurried down the corridor, past a few more doors until she reached the communal showers. Nora paused outside the door to listen for voices. There was nothing but silence. She opened the door and stepped inside, closing it behind her.

The room was small with a single bench along one wall. A row of shower heads hung from the ceiling on chains. Nora stripped off her clothes, then turned on the water. Steam rose up around her as she stood under the spray. She let the hot water wash away the grime of the day and the fatigue of the night before.

Nora stepped out of the shower, toweled herself dry, and dressed in fresh clothing. Then she grabbed a towel and headed back to her quarters.

The corridors were empty now. Nora made it back to her room without incident, but the door wouldn't open. She tried again, but the lock refused to budge. The alarm chirped insistently.

Nora cursed and slammed her fist into the metal. ""Dammit!""

She tried the door again, but it still didn't move. Nora sighed in frustration. She was locked out of her quarters.

""Shit.""

Nora paced the floor for a moment, trying to think of what to do. The colony's power plant was offline, so she couldn't use her communicator or radio to call for help. She had no way to contact the Company. And even if she could get through, there was no guarantee they would send someone to rescue her.

Nora stopped pacing and sat down on the bed. She stared at the door, thinking hard about how she might escape.

She knew the layout of the colony well enough to know where the emergency exits were located. But the doors were heavy and locked from the outside, requiring a keycard access code to open them. She didn't have one.

Nora considered the problem. If she could find an unlocked door, she could probably slip out and make it to the nearest exit without being seen. The problem was finding an unlocked door.

Nora stood up, walked over to the window, and looked out into the darkness. She saw nothing but a few faint stars twinkling in the distance.

She turned around, looking for something else to try. There was only one other option left.

Nora opened the door to her room, stepped inside, closed the door behind her, and locked it. Then she pulled off her clothes and climbed onto the bed.

The mattress was thin and lumpy, and Nora felt the springs dig into her back. She lay down and stared at the ceiling.

102,0.2,0.8,1.0,83.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was empty except for a few colonists heading to work. The colony's power plant was a large, squat building at the center of the complex. A few people were already working inside it, but most of the workers were still asleep.

Nora walked past them, noting the way they moved in their sleep, hunched over like animals. She couldn't help thinking of the aliens she'd seen on the vidscreen. They looked like that too.

She entered the command center, where Sully sat behind a desk. He was a tall man with dark hair and eyes, wearing a crisp uniform. His face was lean and angular, his skin pale.

""Good morning,"" he said without looking up from the display in front of him. ""I'm glad you're here.""

Nora nodded. ""Me too."" She glanced around the room, taking in the rows of consoles and monitors. ""You've got a lot of work to do today. I'll get started on my assignments while you finish your reports.""

Sully raised one eyebrow, then turned back to the screen. ""Thank you, Nora. You can go now.""

Nora left the command center, feeling a little more awake than when she'd arrived. Her stomach rumbled as she walked down the hall toward the cafeteria. She was hungry enough to eat breakfast, but not so hungry that she could ignore her hunger pangs.

The cafeteria was empty except for a few colonists eating at the tables. Nora grabbed a tray and filled it with food, then headed for a table near the door.

She was halfway through her meal when a man approached her. He had short brown hair and wore a crisp uniform like Sully's, but his face was leaner and sharper. His eyes were dark and piercing.

""Excuse me,"" he said. ""Are you Nora Decker?""

Nora looked up from her plate. ""Yes.""

He held out a hand. ""I'm Captain James. I'll be your supervisor today.""

Nora took the offered hand, which felt warm and strong. She stood. ""Nice to meet you, sir.""

""Likewise,"" he said. He gestured toward the other end of the cafeteria. ""Let's get started.""

Nora followed him to a table where two men sat. One was tall with dark hair and eyes, wearing a crisp uniform like Sully's. The other man was shorter and thinner, his face leaner and sharper. His eyes were dark and piercing.

""This is my second in command, Lieutenant Commander Ransome,"" James said. ""And this is your new partner, Nora Decker.""

Ransome nodded at Nora. ""Good morning, Ms. Decker. I'm glad you're here.""

Nora smiled. ""Me too.""

James turned back to the table. ""We'll start with you, Nora.""

Nora pulled out a chair and sat down. She glanced around the room. Most of the colonists were still asleep. A few people ate at their tables, but most of them were hunched over like animals.

She looked back at James. ""What's going on? Why are we starting now?""

""The Company sent us a message last night,"" James said. ""They want us to make contact with the aliens.""

103,0.2,0.8,1.0,87.0,4,45.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to the cafeteria. The colony's dining room was located at the end of the hallway, where the communal showers were also situated.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, her boots clacking on the metallic grating over the floor. She passed the dormitories, the command center, and the power plant. All the while she kept one eye out for drones lurking in the shadows.

The cafeteria was a large open space with rows of tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall, serving food from trays. Nora spotted the familiar faces of her coworkers already seated at their usual table.

She nodded to them as she approached. ""Good morning,"" she said.

""Morning, Nora.""

""How was your night?"" asked a young man with dark hair and a thick beard. He wore a white lab coat over his uniform.

""Long and boring,"" Nora replied. ""I'm starving. Let's get something to eat.""

They sat down together at the table. The other members of the science team were there, too. They were all dressed in the same utilitarian clothing as Nora.

The cafeteria was quiet. Nobody spoke. Everyone ate silently.

After a few minutes, the group finished eating and got up from their seats. Nora headed for the door with her tray, but stopped when she saw a drone standing in the doorway.

It was a small insectoid creature with a long tail and a barbed sting on its back. It stood upright on two legs, like an oversized centipede. Its carapace was black chitin. The drone's head was flat and oval shaped, with a pair of compound eyes set into the top.

Nora froze. She stared at the drone, which didn't move or make any sound.

The drone had been watching her.

She slowly turned around and looked behind her. No drones were visible.

But the drone was still there. Nora felt a chill run down her spine.

""What are you doing here?"" she asked.

The drone did not reply. Nora's heart pounded.

""I don't know what you're talking about,"" Nora said. ""You shouldn't be here.""

She started walking toward the door again, but the drone followed her. Nora glanced over her shoulder and saw it step out of the doorway after her.

Nora ran down the hallway. The drone chased her.

The corridor was long and straight, with no branching paths. Nora sprinted as fast as she could without breaking into a full-out run. Her breath came in ragged gasps. She was afraid of tripping and falling, but the drone was right behind her.

Nora reached the end of the hall. The door to the cafeteria was just ahead. She threw herself through the doorway and slammed into the wall.

The drone caught up with her inside the room. It stood beside her, its barbed tail twitching. Nora stared at it.

""What do you want?"" she demanded.

The drone did not answer. Its compound eyes glowed red.

Nora backed away from the creature and turned around. The drone followed her, keeping pace with her every move. Nora's heart pounded.

104,0.2,0.8,1.0,87.0,3,42.0,"The corridor outside her dormitory was empty. The air smelled stale and musty, like the inside of a closet. She passed several doors, each marked with a number. Each door opened onto a different room, but they were all identical in size and shape.

She walked past the first few rooms without stopping to check them out. Her boots clacked on the metal grating, echoing off the walls. As she approached the end of the hall, Nora slowed down.

The last door was open.

Nora stopped at the threshold and peered through the doorway. A single bed sat in the middle of the small room, surrounded by shelves filled with books. The room was dimly lit, and a faint glow from the window cast shadows across the floor.

A young woman lay asleep on the bed, her head resting on a pillow. She wore a simple white nightgown and had long, dark hair. Nora could see the outline of her face, but not much more.

Nora hesitated for a moment, then stepped into the room and closed the door behind her. She stood there, watching the girl sleep.

The girl's breathing was slow and steady. Her chest rose and fell with each breath. The covers were pulled up to her chin, hiding most of her body. She looked so peaceful, so innocent.

Nora felt a pang of guilt. This girl didn't deserve to be woken up like this.

But Nora couldn't just leave her alone. Not after what she'd seen.

Nora stepped closer and knelt beside the bed. She reached out and gently touched the girl's shoulder. The girl stirred, but didn't wake. Nora shook her lightly. ""Hey,"" she whispered.

The girl blinked in confusion, then sat bolt upright. Her eyes widened and her mouth opened wide in a silent scream. She scrambled away from Nora, clutching the sheets to her chest.

""It's okay,"" Nora said. ""I'm not going to hurt you.""

The girl stared at Nora with wild, terrified eyes. She clutched the sheet tighter, her face pale and sweaty. Her lips trembled.

Nora took a step back. The girl's eyes darted around the room, then settled on Nora again. She swallowed hard, her throat bobbing.

Nora tried to smile reassuringly. ""You're safe here. I won't let anyone hurt you.""

The girl nodded slowly, but didn't relax. Nora could see the fear still etched into her features.

Nora sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed. She reached out and stroked the girl's hair, letting her fingers run through it. The girl flinched, but didn't pull away.

""My name is Nora,"" she said. ""What's yours?""

The girl looked up at her with wide, frightened eyes. She shook her head.

Nora frowned. ""I don't understand. What's your name?""

The girl's eyes went even wider. She shook her head again.

""Please,"" Nora said. ""Tell me what your name is.""

The girl's mouth quivered, but no words came out. She stared at Nora with wide eyes and trembling lips.

Nora reached for the girl's hand and squeezed it gently. ""I'm sorry.

105,0.2,0.8,1.0,75.0,5,47.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by the pale glow of emergency lights. The air smelled stale and dusty, like a tomb. Nora walked briskly, trying to shake off the lethargy of sleep. She passed through the dormitories and headed toward the mess hall where she could grab something quick.

She paused at the entrance to the mess hall, looking around for the first time since waking up. A few colonists sat in the dining area, eating their breakfasts. They looked tired and worn out.

Nora felt a pang of sympathy. She was no stranger to the long hours, but this place seemed especially harsh. She wondered how the colonists managed to keep going.

The colony's artificial intelligence, Alistair, had been designed to run everything from the food supply to the security systems. But Alistair was a machine, not a person. He couldn't feel the same things that Nora did. And he didn't have any friends.

Alistair was an AI, and so he wasn't human. That made him different than the Company executives who ran Presley's Promise. The Company execs were people, and they weren't machines. They had feelings, and they cared about each other.

Nora sighed as she entered the mess hall. She'd never thought of it like that before, but now that she did, she realized how much more she missed having a friend.

The colonists ate quietly in the dimly lit room. Nora took her tray and sat down at one of the tables, trying to ignore the stares of the others. She was used to being alone, but this place was different. She felt isolated and lonely.

Nora picked up her fork and poked at a piece of scrambled egg. The eggs tasted bland, but the food was filling. She was hungry enough to eat until she was full.

She glanced around the table again. Most of the colonists were eating in silence, staring into their trays or looking out the window. Nora wondered if they could hear the drone of the drones outside.

The colony's artificial intelligence, Alistair, was supposed to be able to detect and respond to threats. But he hadn't done anything since the first day.

Nora finished her meal and pushed back from the table. She stood up, grabbed her tray, and walked toward the door.

The colonists watched her go with curious expressions on their faces. Nora ignored them and headed for the exit.

Outside, the air felt colder than it had in the dormitories. The sky was overcast, and the wind whipped at Nora's hair as she hurried across the grounds.

Nora paused when she reached the main corridor. She looked up and down the empty hallway, then turned and began walking briskly. Her boots clacked loudly on the metal flooring.

The corridors were long and straight, running parallel to each other. The walls were made of thick plates of metallic material, which reflected the dim light from emergency lamps. Nora passed several doors along the way, but she didn't stop to look inside any of them.

She knew where she was going. She'd been here before.

Nora followed the corridor until it ended at a large steel door. It was locked.

Nora stopped and stared at the door. She wasn't sure what to do.

106,0.2,0.8,1.0,82.0,3,46.0,"The colony's main hall was dimly lit by emergency lights. The air smelled stale, but the scent of coffee wafted from the kitchen at the end of the hall.

Nora followed the smell to the kitchen where a few colonists were already gathered around the long table. They greeted her as she entered, and she nodded back.

""Morning,"" said Sully, who was sitting in the corner of the room. He stood up to greet her, and Nora returned his smile.

""Good morning."" She took a seat next to him. ""I'm glad you're here. I need your help with something.""

Sully looked at her curiously, then shrugged. ""Sure. What do you need?""

Nora leaned forward and lowered her voice so only he could hear. ""The alarm went off this morning, and it's not working right.""

He frowned. ""What does that mean? Is it broken?""

She shook her head. ""No, but the siren doesn't sound like it's going off. It sounds like someone is trying to shut it down.""

Sully's frown deepened. ""That's weird. Why would anyone try to turn off an alarm?""

""I don't know. But we have to find out who did it and why. Can you get me into the security system?""

""Yeah, sure. I can do that. You want to go now?""

Nora nodded. ""Yes.""

Sully stood up and led the way back to his office. He opened a drawer and pulled out a small device, which he handed to Nora. ""This will let you into the security system. Just plug it in and press the button on top.""

Nora accepted the device and slipped it into her pocket. ""Thanks, Sully.""

Sully smiled. ""Don't mention it.""

Nora left the kitchen and walked through the main hall toward the command center. The alarm was still blaring, but the siren had stopped. She paused outside the door to the control room, listening for any sign of activity inside.

""Hello?"" she called. ""Anyone there?""

The silence was deafening.

She pushed open the door and stepped inside. The lights were off, but a dim red glow from emergency lighting illuminated the room.

Nora looked around, searching for Eve's disembodied voice. ""Eve? Are you here?""

No response came from the speakers or anywhere else.

""Eve!"" she shouted again, louder this time.

A faint sound like a sigh echoed through the room. Nora spun around to see a dark figure standing behind her.

It was Valentina Kern.

Nora stared at her in shock, then backed away. ""What are you doing?""

Valentina didn't answer. Instead, she moved closer, her eyes glowing with an eerie light.

Nora turned and ran.

CHAPTER 1

""I'm not going to let you kill me,"" said Nora, running down the hall toward the exit.

She heard a hissing sound behind her, but she couldn't look back to see what it was. Her heart pounded in her chest and sweat dripped into her eyes.

107,0.2,0.8,1.0,88.0,5,45.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to work. Nora passed by them without a glance, her eyes fixed on the ground as she walked. She was too tired for pleasantries.

Nora's boots clacked on the metal grating as she made her way through the colony, following the path to the cafeteria. The corridors were lined with doors leading to the various work areas of the colony. Nora followed the route to the cafeteria, passing the engineering bays, where the power plant was located.

She entered the cafeteria just as the first colonists arrived. A few glanced at Nora as they sat down to eat. She ignored their stares.

Nora took her seat at one of the long tables and waited for the food to arrive. As she ate, she watched the other colonists around her. They talked quietly among themselves, but no one spoke to Nora. She didn't mind. It was better that way.

After finishing her meal, Nora left the cafeteria and headed back to her quarters. She passed by the dormitories, then turned right into the residential wing. Her footsteps echoed in the empty hallway.

Nora stopped outside her door. She felt a twinge of guilt as she thought about the colonists who slept inside. But she couldn't help it. She was too tired to care.

The door slid open with a hiss, and Nora stepped inside. The room was dark, lit only by the dim glow of the corridor lights. Nora flipped on the light switch beside her bed, which illuminated the room with a soft blue glow.

She sighed as she saw the mess of clothes strewn across the floor. Nora kicked off her boots and tossed them aside, then pulled off her jacket and hung it up. She stripped out of her shirt and pants, leaving her in just her underwear.

Nora flopped onto the bed, exhausted from her shift. She lay there for a moment, staring at the ceiling, then rolled over and fell asleep.

When Nora awoke, the room was still dark. She sat up in bed, blinking. The room was quiet except for the low hum of machinery.

Nora got out of bed and walked to the window. She looked down on the colony, which was bathed in starlight. A few colonists were walking around outside, but most of the buildings were dark.

She checked her watch. It was after midnight. Nora had slept through the entire day. She'd missed breakfast.

Nora turned away from the window and headed to her bathroom. She showered quickly, then dressed in fresh clothes. She grabbed her boots and jacket before heading back to the cafeteria.

The dining hall was empty. Nora took a seat at one of the long tables, where she ate alone. She didn't mind. She wasn't hungry anyway.

After finishing her meal, Nora left the cafeteria. She passed by the dormitories and continued on toward the command center. The corridors were quiet as Nora made her way through them.

She reached the command center and entered. The air was cool and dry, with a faint tang of ozone. The walls were lined with monitors displaying various views of the colony.

Nora walked past the rows of consoles until she found the engineering bay. She stepped inside and stopped at the console in front of the main door.

108,0.2,0.8,1.0,90.0,5,47.0,"The corridor outside the dormitory was dimly lit by the same distant starlight as the rest of the colony, but the walls were lined with windows that let in plenty of natural light. The hallways were wide and spacious, and the colonists had decorated them with colorful murals depicting their history and culture.

Nora walked past a mural of a young woman with long black hair and green eyes, her arms raised in triumph over the heads of two men who lay dead at her feet. She smiled wryly. Nora was that girl.

The mural depicted the first time she'd ever seen another human being. She'd been ten years old when her parents brought her to Presley's Promise for the first time. The colonists had welcomed Nora with open arms, and she'd felt like a princess among peasants.

She passed through the dining area where the colonists ate breakfast. A few of them glanced up from their meals as she passed, but most ignored her. She didn't blame them.

Nora made her way down the main concourse, which was filled with people working or eating. Most of the colonists were already awake and busy. She spotted a group of four engineers in the command center, talking animatedly about something. They looked up as Nora approached, and one of them waved her over.

""Hey there, Nora,"" said the man. ""You're early.""

""I'm not late, I just got here myself. What's going on?""

""We've got a problem with the power plant. It's overheating again. We need you to come check it out.""

Nora frowned. The power plant was the heart of the colony. If it broke down, the entire community would be in jeopardy.

""What's wrong with it? Is it broken?""

The engineer shook his head. ""No. The reactor is fine. But we can't get any heat out of the system. There's no steam, so we don't have any pressure. And the temperature keeps rising.""

Nora nodded. She knew what was happening. Steam wasn't coming out of the pipes because the pipes were clogged with debris. That meant the reactor had to be leaking radiation into the air, which was why the colonists couldn't breathe.

""Can you fix it?"" she asked.

""Yeah,"" he said. ""But it'll take a while.""

""How long?""

He shrugged. ""A couple hours, maybe more.""

Nora sighed. She'd been hoping for an easy solution. The colonists were already running low on food and water. They needed the power plant working right now.

She turned away from the engineers, heading back to her quarters. As she walked past the hydroponic greenhouses, she noticed a few of them were open, but most were still closed. The colonists would need their crops if they wanted to feed themselves.

Nora entered the dormitory and found her roommate, Sarah, sitting up in bed reading a book. Her dark hair was pulled back into a ponytail, and she wore a loose shirt and pants over bare feet. She looked up at Nora with a smile.

""Hey,"" said Nora.

109,0.2,0.8,1.0,79.0,5,40.0,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights and lined with utilitarian furniture. The walls were made of metallic plates, grating, and conduits. Furniture and decor were futuristic and utilitarian. Interiors were cramped and claustrophobic with shadowed corners.

Nora walked briskly down the corridor, her boots clacking on the metal grate flooring. Her footsteps echoed in the empty hallways. She passed a few colonists who sat at tables, eating their breakfasts.

The colonists'breakfast was served cafeteria style. They ate from trays set out on long tables. Each table had its own food dispenser, which filled the tray with fresh fruit, bread, eggs, and other items.

Nora stopped to refill her tray when she saw a man sitting alone at one of the tables. He wore a dark blue uniform with a red stripe down the side of his trousers. His hair was short and black, but he sported a neatly trimmed beard and mustache.

He looked up as Nora approached him. ""Good morning,"" he said in a deep voice.

""Morning."" Nora nodded politely. She took her tray and moved on.

She found an empty seat at another table and sat down. A young woman with brown skin, curly black hair, and bright green eyes smiled at her. ""Hi there!""

Nora returned the smile. ""Hello.""

The girl's name was Lacey. She worked in the hydroponics section, where she tended the plants growing in the greenhouse.

Lacey was a cheerful person with a ready laugh and a quick wit. She had a friendly disposition and a warm, open personality.

Nora liked her.

""You're new here?"" Lacey asked.

""Yes.""

""I'm glad you decided to join us. We need more people like you.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks.""

The colonists were a diverse group. They came from different backgrounds and cultures, but they shared one thing in common—they wanted to live on this planet. The Company had promised them a better life than the one they'd left behind.

But the Company didn't care about their promises. It only cared about profit.

Nora finished her breakfast and stood up. She walked back toward her quarters, which were located near the command center.

The colony's command center was a large room with a high ceiling and several rows of desks. Each desk held a computer terminal, a monitor screen, and a keyboard. A few colonists sat at the terminals, working on their assignments.

Nora stopped in front of one of the terminals. She tapped her fingers impatiently while she waited for the system to boot up.

The terminal beeped and flashed green. The screen displayed a message.

Eve, the artificial intelligence running the colony, greeted Nora. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied. ""What's going on?""

""You have an assignment today. You will go to the power plant and repair a malfunctioning generator.""

Nora frowned. ""Why me? I'm not an engineer.""

Nora walked briskly to the cafeteria where she found a line of people waiting for food. As she joined the end of the queue, she noticed that the other colonists looked tired. They wore clothes that had seen better days, their faces were gaunt, and they moved slowly.

Nora was hungry too, but she wasn't going to let herself get distracted by hunger. She'd been working long hours lately, and the last thing she needed was to be late for her shift.

The line inched forward. Nora waited patiently, watching the clock tick down until it reached zero. She stepped up to the counter and placed her order.

""Breakfast,"" she said. ""Two eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee.""

The woman behind the counter nodded at Nora's order, then turned away to prepare her food. Nora took a seat in one of the plastic chairs lining the wall. She watched the woman cook, and the way the steam rose from the scrambled eggs made her stomach rumble.

She was just finishing her meal when the woman returned with two plates of food. Nora thanked her, and she left without a word.

Nora ate quickly, washing down each bite with gulps of hot black coffee. When she finished, she stood and walked back to her quarters.

Her room was small but clean. The walls were bare metal, and the floor was covered by a thin layer of dust. A single bed sat in the corner, and a desk and chair occupied the center. There was no window, so Nora had to rely on the emergency lights for illumination.

She set her plate down on the desk, then pulled out the chair and sat. Her eyes fell on the clock above the door. It read 7: 30 AM.

Nora sighed. She'd slept in, and she didn't like it. But she was already late for her shift.

Nora pushed herself up from the chair. She grabbed her jacket off the back of the chair and slipped into it, then headed to the cafeteria.

The line was shorter than before, but Nora still waited patiently. When her turn came, she placed her order.

Nora's boots clomped loudly on the metal grating, echoing off the rock walls. She passed several colonists heading in the other direction, some of them yawning and rubbing their eyes. A few glanced up at her, then looked away again.

She was used to this. Nora had been living in the colony for a year now. She'd seen people look away from her, too.

Nora tried not to think about it.

The dining hall was crowded with colonists eating breakfast. Nora spotted her friend, Dr. Jules, sitting alone at one of the tables. He waved when he saw Nora approaching.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said Jules. ""I see you're already up.""

""Yeah, I'm starving,"" Nora replied. She sat down across from him. ""How are things?""

Jules shrugged. ""Same old. We've got a new batch of supplies coming in today. They should be here by noon, so we can get back to work.""

Nora nodded. ""What's the plan for today? Are we going out exploring again?""

""No, it's just another day of boring stuff. We'll probably go over the schematics for the power plant again. It's been a while since we did any maintenance on the fusion reactor, and we haven't had time to do much else. The drones keep us busy enough.""

Nora sighed. ""I wish they'd let me go out with you guys sometimes.""

""You don't like being cooped up in here?"" Jules asked.

""It's not that,"" Nora said. ""I mean, I know it's important work, but I want to get outside more often. I feel trapped.""

""Well, you're stuck here for now,"" said Jules. ""We'll have plenty of time to explore later on. You can come along if you want.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks, I'd love to.""

The two ate breakfast in silence for a few minutes before Nora spoke again. ""So, what's the plan for today?""

Jules shrugged. ""Same old, same old. We'll go over the schematics again, then maybe take a look at some of the equipment. Maybe we can figure out where the drones are coming from.""

""Sounds good,"" said Nora. She finished her meal and stood up. ""See you later.""

Nora walked back to her quarters, passing several colonists heading in the other direction. They glanced at her, but didn't stop or speak.

She was used to this too.

Nora returned to her room and changed into a pair of utility pants and a long-sleeved shirt. She pulled on a jacket, then grabbed her tool belt and headed out again.

The corridor outside Nora's room was dimly lit by a few lights spaced at regular intervals along the walls, but the air was still cold. The temperature dropped quickly as she walked toward the communal dining hall.

Nora's boots clomped loudly on the metal grating, echoing off the rock walls.

112,0.2,0.9,1.0,74.0,4,45.0,"The corridor was empty except for Sully's office at the end. He sat behind a desk, reading over reports from his assistant. The door to the outer offices stood open, letting in a breeze that stirred Nora's hair.

""Morning,"" she said as she walked past him.

Sully looked up from the papers he held. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora nodded back. She'd been working for Sully since her arrival on the planet two years ago. He was a tall man with dark skin and black hair, dressed in a crisp white shirt and gray slacks. His eyes were sharp and intelligent, but his face was lined with worry and fatigue.

He set down the papers and rose to meet her. ""You're late again.""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm not going to be able to get any more sleep tonight. I'll make it up tomorrow.""

Sully shook his head. ""It's not about that. You've got a reputation for being punctual. It's a bad habit you need to break.""

""What do you mean?"" Nora asked, frowning. She didn't like the way Sully was looking at her.

""You're supposed to be a good engineer,"" he said. ""But you don't care about your work. You just want to sleep.""

Nora's jaw tightened. ""That's not true.""

""Yes, it is. You know what I think? I think you're afraid of this place. Afraid of the aliens who live here. And you're trying to hide that fear from me. But I see through it. I can tell when you're lying. So why don't we stop wasting time and get to the point?""

Nora stared at him, stunned into silence. She'd never seen Sully angry before. He was usually so calm and collected.

""You're fired,"" he said flatly. ""Get out.""

Nora blinked in shock. Her mouth opened but no sound came out.

Sully's eyes narrowed. ""I'm serious. Get out. Now.""

She swallowed hard, then nodded. ""All right.""

""Good,"" Sully said. ""Now get the hell out of my office.""

Nora turned on her heel and walked away, leaving the door open behind her. She didn't look back.

The corridor was empty except for a few colonists walking to breakfast. Nora passed them without acknowledging their presence, heading straight for the cafeteria. The smell of food made her stomach growl.

At the end of the hall, she stepped into the main room. It was filled with tables and chairs arranged around long counters. A line of people waited to order from the automated kiosks.

Nora took a seat at one of the tables and ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, orange juice, and coffee. She sat alone, but she wasn't really hungry anyway.

She sipped at her drink while she watched the other customers eat. They were all dressed in loose-fitting clothes that covered most of their bodies, but they still looked like humans.

Nora had been on the planet for two years now. In that time, she'd seen no sign of aliens. But she knew there must be some. The Company was always sending supply ships.

She finished her meal and left the cafeteria, walking down the corridor toward the hydroponic greenhouses.

113,0.2,0.9,1.0,79.0,4,46.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty, but the communal showers at the end of each hallway were occupied by colonists waiting their turn. The air smelled of soap and sweat, and the sound of running water filled the halls.

Nora walked past a few other colonists as she made her way to the cafeteria. Her boots clacked loudly on the metallic grating, echoing off the walls. She passed through the cafeteria doors, where the smell of fresh coffee wafted across the room.

The dining area was crowded with colonists eating breakfast. Nora spotted several familiar faces among the crowd. She smiled as she saw her friend, Dr. Ralston, sitting at one of the tables.

Nora approached the table, and the doctor looked up from his plate. He wore a white lab coat over a crisp button-up shirt and slacks. His hair was neatly combed, and he had a full beard that matched his mustache.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said the doctor. ""I see you're already here.""

""Morning, Doc,"" said Nora. She sat down beside him and took a sip of her coffee. ""How's the research going?""

Dr. Ralston shrugged. ""Slowly, I'm afraid. We've been working on a new strain of yeast for the last few weeks, but it hasn't worked out yet.""

Nora nodded. She knew the doctor was frustrated with his work. The colony was a long way from Earth, and the Company didn't have much to offer. But they were still trying to find something useful to do.

""What about you? How are things at the command center?"" asked Dr. Ralston.

Nora sighed. ""Same old, same old. They're always complaining about how hard everything is. I wish they'd just let us get on with our jobs and stop asking for more help. It's not like we can spare any.""

""You know what I mean,"" said the doctor. ""They don't seem to understand that you're doing your best.""

""Yeah, well, maybe if they did, they wouldn't be so quick to complain. You know, I think I'll go check on the power plant today. Maybe I can fix some of the problems there. If nothing else, it might make them happy.""

The doctor smiled. ""That's a good idea. Let me know when you're ready to leave.""

Nora nodded and finished her coffee. She stood up and headed for the door, but paused before leaving.

""Oh, Doc,"" said Nora. ""I almost forgot. There was one thing I wanted to ask you about.""

Dr. Ralston looked at her curiously. ""Yes?""

""Well, it's kind of personal... but I'm wondering if you could look into something for me. I need to know about my family history.""

""Of course,"" said Dr. Ralston. He leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over the table. ""What do you want to know?""

""My mother's side of the family. My grandmother was a scientist, and I've heard stories about her work.

114,0.2,0.9,1.0,87.0,5,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a single overhead bulb. The walls were painted in a dark gray, the ceiling in a lighter shade of gray. A few steps from her door, she turned right to walk down the hall toward the communal showers at the end.

The colony's power plant hummed in the background like a giant engine. Nora walked past the rows of doors that led to other parts of the complex. At the end of the hallway, she entered the large open area where the colonists gathered for meals and recreation.

A handful of people sat around tables eating breakfast. Nora spotted several familiar faces among them, including her roommate, Sarah, who was sitting with two others.

Sarah looked up when Nora approached. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied. She took a seat across from Sarah and the other two women.

Nora had been friends with Sarah since they were both children, but their friendship had been strained for the last year or so. They'd grown apart after Nora started dating Jake, Sarah's boyfriend.

Jake was a good guy, but he wasn't interested in pursuing a relationship with Nora. He was too focused on his career. And while Nora appreciated the attention Jake gave her, she didn't want to be tied down by him.

She wanted more than that. She needed it.

But Nora couldn't tell Sarah that. Not yet, anyway. She hadn't told anyone about her feelings for Jake.

""You look tired,"" Sarah said. ""Are you okay?""

Nora nodded. ""I'm fine.""

Sarah's eyes narrowed, and she leaned forward. ""What happened? Did something go wrong with the equipment again?""

""No,"" Nora said. She glanced around at the other colonists. ""It's nothing like that.""

Sarah frowned, and her friends exchanged glances.

Nora sighed. ""Look, I know this is hard for you guys to understand, but we're not in danger. We've got a malfunctioning power plant, but the Company's engineers are working on it. It'll be fixed soon. Until then, we just have to deal with the inconvenience.""

The three women stared at Nora blankly.

""We'll get through this,"" Nora insisted.

Sarah shook her head. ""I don't think so. You should tell someone. They'll help you.""

Nora's stomach clenched in fear. She knew Sarah was right, but she couldn't bring herself to say it. Not yet. ""I will,"" she promised.

Sarah nodded. ""Okay. Good luck.""

Nora stood up and walked away from the table. She didn't want to be around people anymore. She needed time alone. Time to think about what she'd done.

She headed for the engineering bays, where she could work on her project without being disturbed. The colony's power plant was a massive fusion reactor that provided most of the electricity for the complex. It had been built in the early twenty-first century, and its design dated back to the days when humanity still believed in the future.

Nora entered one of the bays, which were lined with rows of machinery. She sat down at a workbench and started sorting through her tools.

115,0.2,0.9,1.0,79.0,3,47.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by small lights set in the walls at regular intervals. The hallways were narrow, but wide enough for two people to walk side by side. Nora's boots clacked loudly on the metal grating as she walked along the corridor. She passed a few colonists heading in the opposite direction, but none of them acknowledged her presence.

Nora stopped outside the communal kitchen. A large, circular room filled with long tables and benches was attached to the power plant. At this early hour, the room was empty except for a handful of colonists eating breakfast. Nora took a seat at one of the tables and waited for someone to notice her.

A young woman approached from the other end of the room. She wore a blue jumpsuit with a white collar, and her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail. Her face was pale, and her eyes were red and puffy. She looked like she hadn't slept well.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as the girl sat down across from her. ""I'm sorry I woke you.""

The girl nodded. ""It's okay. You're not the first person who has woken me up this way.""

Nora smiled. ""You must be new here.""

""Yeah, just arrived yesterday."" The girl rubbed her eyes and sighed. ""I can't believe how tired I am.""

Nora leaned forward. ""Are you sure you don't want to take a nap? It'll make your shift go faster.""

The girl shook her head. ""No, it's fine. I'll get through it. But thanks for the offer.""

""Okay."" Nora stood and stretched. She glanced around the room. ""Do you know where the cafeteria is?""

The girl pointed. ""Down the hall, second door on the right.""

Nora nodded and walked away. She passed several colonists heading in the opposite direction, but none of them acknowledged her presence.

She reached the cafeteria and found a table near the back. The room was dimly lit with small lights set into the walls. A few people sat at the tables, eating breakfast or talking quietly. Nora took a seat at an empty table and waited for someone to notice her.

A man approached from the other end of the room. He wore a dark blue jumpsuit with a white collar and his hair was cut short. His face was pale and he looked exhausted.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as he sat down across from her. ""I'm sorry I woke you up.""

The man nodded. ""It's okay. You're not the first person who has woken me up this way.""

Nora smiled. ""Are you sure you don't want to take a nap? It'll make your shift go faster.""

The man shook his head. ""No, it's fine. I'll get through it. But thanks for the offer.""

116,0.2,0.9,1.0,83.0,4,42.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to work. The colony's power plant was at the end of the long hallway, where a large door marked 'Engineering' stood open. Nora walked past the door and turned right, toward the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a wide room filled with tables and chairs. A long counter ran along one wall, serving food and drinks. Nora passed the counter and headed for the back of the room, where the kitchen was located.

She found the kitchen staff busy preparing breakfast for the colonists. The cooks wore white coats over their uniforms and aprons over their shirts, with hairnets covering their heads. They worked in silence, efficiently chopping vegetables, slicing meat, and cooking eggs.

Nora paused to watch them. She had never seen so many people working together in such a tight space. It seemed like a miracle that they could keep up with the demands of feeding everyone.

A young woman approached Nora, wiping her hands on her apron and smiling at her. ""Good morning, Miss Decker.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied. ""I'm supposed to be meeting Sully for breakfast. Do you know where he is?""

The cook shook her head. ""He's not here yet. I think he went out early this morning to check on some equipment."" She pointed toward the front of the cafeteria.

Nora nodded. ""Thanks.""

She walked through the dining area and into the main hall, where a few colonists were already gathered around the tables. Nora spotted Sully at one table near the far wall. He was eating breakfast with two other men.

Sully looked up when Nora entered, and his eyes widened in surprise. ""Good morning, Nora. You're late.""

Nora shrugged. ""I overslept."" She sat down across from him.

The other colonists stared at her. One man's mouth hung open, and another made a choking noise. Nora ignored them.

""You look tired,"" Sully said. ""Did you get any sleep last night?""

""No."" Nora scowled. ""I was up until four in the morning fixing a power loader that wouldn't start. The damn thing keeps overheating and shutting off.""

""That's terrible,"" Sully said sympathetically. ""I hope you got it fixed.""

Nora nodded. ""It took me most of the day, but I finally got it running again."" She sighed. ""But now I'm hungry.""

Sully smiled. ""Then let's eat. We've got plenty of time before we have to go back out there.""

They ate breakfast in silence. Nora was too preoccupied with her thoughts to enjoy the food. Sully noticed, and offered a sympathetic smile. ""Are you okay?""

Nora shrugged. ""I guess so."" She pushed her plate away. ""What about you? How's your arm?""

Sully grimaced. ""Still hurts like hell. But I'll be fine.""

""Good."" Nora nodded. ""I'm glad you're going out today. You'll need the rest.""

Sully gave her a wry grin. ""Yeah, well... I'll try not to get killed.""

Nora laughed. ""Don't worry. If you do die, I'll make sure you don't come back.""

117,0.2,0.9,1.0,90.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each door a small window into the rooms beyond. Nora paused at one of these windows to look inside.

A young woman sat up in bed, rubbing her eyes as she looked around blearily. Her hair was long and black, falling past her shoulders in loose waves. She wore a simple white nightgown that left her arms and legs bare. A thin blanket covered her lap.

Nora watched the girl's face for a moment, then turned away.

She walked down the hall to the communal kitchen.

The colonists ate together in a large dining area with rows of tables. Nora found a seat near the back, where she could watch the door.

The colonists were already seated when Nora arrived. They greeted her with nods and murmured greetings.

Nora took a tray from a passing server and filled it with food. She carried the tray over to her table, set it down, and began eating.

The colonists were quiet while they ate. No one spoke. The only sound was the clink of utensils on plates.

After a few minutes, Nora finished her meal. She pushed her plate away and stood up.

""I'm going to check the farms,"" she said. ""If I don't come back, you're in charge.""

The colonists nodded.

Nora left the dining room and headed out of the colony. She passed through a series of corridors and stairwells, heading deeper into the complex until she reached an elevator shaft.

She stepped inside the elevator car and pressed the button for the agricultural section. The doors closed with a hiss.

The elevator descended slowly, its lights dimming to a dull red glow. Nora stared at the walls and floor of the car, trying to ignore the claustrophobic sensation.

The elevator stopped and opened. Nora stepped out, blinking in the sudden brightness.

The corridor was narrow, lined with metal grating. The air smelled like dust and old machinery.

Nora walked down the corridor, looking around warily. The hallway was empty. She turned a corner and found herself facing a blank wall.

She frowned and looked back the way she'd come. There should be another turn ahead. Nora started walking forward again, but then paused.

Something wasn't right.

Nora's eyes narrowed. She glanced back the way she'd come. The corridor was still empty.

A shiver ran down her spine.

She took a step back, then another. Her heart thudded in her chest.

The corridor was too quiet. It felt wrong.

Nora turned and sprinted away from the wall. She raced down the hall, not knowing where she was going or what she would do when she got there.

The corridor ended in a T intersection. Nora stopped and spun around, searching for an exit.

The corridor was silent. No one else was here.

Nora stared at the intersection.

The cafeteria was large and open, with long tables and benches lining the walls. A wide counter ran along one side, where a line of colonists waited to order their meals. The air was thick with steam and the smell of food. Nora paused to take it all in, then spotted the familiar face of her friend, Dr. John.

""Hey!"" she called out. ""I'm late for my shift.""

John turned around, his expression grim. ""You're not going to make it, Nora. I've already sent your replacement down to the hydroponics section. You'll have to start without you.""

Nora's heart sank. She knew what was coming next.

""But..."" Nora protested. ""I just got here. I can't leave now. What about the equipment?""

John shook his head. ""It'll be fine. We can manage until you get back.""

Nora bit her lip. She didn't want to go, but she couldn't argue with the doctor. He was right; they needed every engineer on duty if they were going to keep the colony running.

She sighed. ""All right, I'll see you later.""

""Good luck,"" John said.

Nora nodded and headed for the door. She had to get to work before she lost her nerve.

The corridor outside was empty, so Nora hurried toward the hydroponics bay. The air inside smelled of soil and fertilizer. Nora paused at a crossroads to check her map, then turned left into the hydroponic section.

Hydroponics bays were large rooms filled with rows of greenhouses. Each greenhouse was enclosed in a transparent dome to protect crops from the elements. Nora passed several other colonists working in the hydroponics area, but none acknowledged her presence.

Nora stopped when she reached the end of the row. A pair of doors marked the entrance to the hydroponics section, but they stood open. She peered through the doorway and saw nothing but darkness beyond.

""Hello?"" she called out.

No one answered.

Nora stepped forward, her eyes adjusting to the dim light. She could see a few feet ahead, but everything else was shrouded in shadow. The hydroponics room seemed vast and endless.

Nora walked down the center aisle between the rows of greenhouses, trying to stay alert for any sign of danger. She kept her hands near her sides and tried not to let her imagination run wild.

The air was thick with humidity and the smell of soil. Nora's boots crunched on gravel beneath her feet. The sound echoed off the walls, making it difficult to hear anything over the hum of machinery.

Most of the rooms were empty, but one door opened onto a small kitchenette. A few colonists sat at tables, eating their breakfasts as they read reports and studied schematics.

Nora paused to look around. She was the only person in the hall. Her footsteps echoed off the metallic walls, making her feel like she was walking through a tomb.

She walked past the kitchenette and down the corridor toward the command center. At the end of the hall, the main concourse was filled with people. Nora could hear voices and clatter from the cafeteria beyond the wide glass windows.

A man in uniform stood in front of the cafeteria entrance, blocking her way. He wore a dark blue jumpsuit and a black helmet that covered his head. His face was obscured by a mask of opaque material.

Nora stopped in her tracks. She recognized him.

""Commander Valentina Kern,"" Nora said. ""I'm supposed to report for duty.""

The masked man didn't move. He just stared at her.

""You're not going to let me pass?""

He didn't answer.

Nora took a step forward, then another. The masked man didn't budge.

Nora's eyes narrowed. She knew this guy. This was the commander of security.

""What do you want?"" she demanded.

The masked man shifted his weight. He looked at her again, and Nora felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.

She turned away and walked toward the cafeteria. She heard a muffled voice behind her, but couldn't make out what he was saying.

Nora ignored it and pushed through the door into the cafeteria. It was crowded with colonists who were already eating breakfast. A few glanced over their shoulders at her.

Nora sat down at a table near the window and picked up a cup of coffee. She sipped it slowly while she watched the people around her.

A young woman in a dark blue jumpsuit approached Nora. ""Good morning,"" she said. ""I'm Lieutenant Gail.""

""Lieutenant?"" Nora asked.

Gail nodded. ""Yes, I'm one of the new recruits. You're Commander Decker, right? The engineer?""

Nora nodded. ""That's me.""

""I've been assigned to your team,"" Gail said.

Nora frowned. ""My team?""

""You'll be working with us for a while. We're going to need you to help us figure out how to fix the equipment.""

Nora's frown deepened. She didn't like the sound of that.

""What kind of equipment?"" Nora asked.

""The power plant. The fusion reactor. Everything.""

Nora stared at her.

""We have some problems with the reactor,"" Gail continued. ""It's old and it doesn't work very well. It needs maintenance, but we don't know how to do it. And the power loaders are malfunctioning too.""

""Power loaders?"" Nora asked.

""They're used to move heavy objects. They can lift things up off the ground.

120,0.3,0.4,1.0,83.0,4,44.0,"The corridors were dim, lit only by the faint glow of emergency lights. The air smelled like dust and sweat, but the scent was oddly comforting. She walked past the dormitories and out to the main hall where she could see the kitchen.

A few colonists sat at tables, eating breakfast. A few others stood in line for food. Others worked behind counters preparing meals or cleaning up after the previous night's meal.

Nora paused to look around, taking in the scene. It was a stark contrast to the bustling mess hall back on Earth. Here, everything seemed so small and fragile.

She shook her head. She'd been working too hard lately.

She continued down the hallway, passing the cafeteria and coming to the front doors. They were open slightly, letting in a breeze that stirred the dust motes floating in the air.

Nora stepped outside. The sun had risen above the horizon, but it wasn't yet high enough to burn off the morning fog. She squinted, trying to make out details of the landscape beyond the colony walls. The ground was rocky and uneven with jagged boulders scattered across the flatlands. She couldn't see anything else.

The wind whipped her hair around as she walked toward the edge of the cliff. Nora stopped, leaning on one hand against a rock. She stared out at the landscape, feeling the grit between her fingers.

""I can't believe I'm doing this,"" she muttered. ""This is insane.""

Nora sighed and turned away from the cliff. She made her way back to the main building, pausing briefly to glance into the cafeteria. Several colonists were sitting around tables, talking.

She stepped inside and went to the counter. The woman behind it looked up. Her face was pale, her eyes bloodshot and weary.

""Good morning, Nora,"" she said. ""You're late for breakfast.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, sorry about that. I overslept.""

The woman smiled faintly. ""It's okay. You've been working hard lately.""

Nora shrugged. ""I guess so.""

The woman handed her a tray. ""Here you go. Breakfast is ready. Enjoy your meal.""

Nora took the tray and headed back outside. She paused in front of the doors, looking out at the landscape again.

She had no idea where she was going.

""What am I doing?"" she asked herself. ""I'm not qualified for this.""

Nora shook her head and stepped outside. The wind whipped around her, but it didn't seem cold enough to be winter. She walked toward the edge of the cliff.

The ground dropped away sharply below her. Nora stared down at the rocks far below.

""Oh God...""

She heard a noise. It sounded like something moving. Nora looked around, trying to see what it was. She couldn't tell. The fog obscured everything except for the cliff face.

Nora felt a chill run through her body. Something moved out there.

""Is someone there?"" she called into the mist.

No answer.

Nora shivered. ""Hello? Is anyone there?""

Still nothing.

121,0.3,0.4,1.0,91.0,4,42.0,"The colony's main hall was empty except for a few colonists at the far end. They were gathered around a communal table, playing cards. The game was familiar to Nora. She'd played it when she was younger, but her parents had forbidden it.

She walked past them, nodding in greeting. Her boots clacked on the metal grating as she passed through the open archway to the cafeteria.

The dining room was long and narrow, filled with tables and chairs arranged in rows. A tall window ran along one wall, overlooking the rocky landscape outside.

Nora sat alone at the end of the last row, where the tables were closest to the window. She placed her tray on a nearby table, then took a seat and waited for the automated food dispenser to deliver her meal.

A few minutes later, a robotic arm extended from the ceiling, holding a plate with a steaming bowl of oatmeal and a glass of water. Nora lifted the spoon and dug in.

The oatmeal was thick and creamy, rich with butter and sugar. It tasted like heaven. She ate quickly, savoring every bite.

As she finished her breakfast, Nora noticed a young man sitting at the table across from her. He looked to be about twenty years old, though his face was gaunt and drawn. His dark hair hung lankly over his forehead.

Nora watched him eat, wondering if he'd been awake when she came out of bed. The young man's eyes were hollow and red rimmed.

He didn't seem to notice her, so Nora decided not to make any more noise than necessary. She pushed back her chair and stood up, pulling her jacket closed as she did.

The young man glanced up at her with a vacant stare. Nora took this as an invitation to sit down again. She pulled out the chair opposite him and sat down, trying to look friendly.

""Good morning,"" she said. ""I'm Nora.""

The young man nodded without speaking. He picked up a spoon and began eating again.

Nora waited for several minutes, but the young man didn't say anything else. She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table and clasping her hands together in front of her.

""Do you live here?"" she asked.

The young man looked at her, then shrugged. He set his utensils down and stared into his bowl.

Nora frowned. ""What's wrong? Are you sick or something?""

The young man shook his head. ""No.""

""Then what is it?"" Nora demanded, leaning closer.

The young man looked at her with haunted eyes. He reached out slowly, placing his hand over hers. His skin felt cold and clammy. His fingers were thin and bony.

Nora snatched her hand away with a gasp. She jumped up, knocking her chair backward. The young man didn't move. Nora backed toward the door, feeling panic rising inside of her.

She turned and ran down the hall, bumping into a few colonists who stopped to watch her go. She ignored them and kept running until she burst through the archway and out onto the rocky landscape outside.

122,0.3,0.4,1.0,87.0,5,46.0,"The dormitory hallways were quiet, but not empty. Most colonists slept late, so Nora found herself in the company of a few other early risers. She passed two women in their twenties who looked like twins, sharing a room at the end of the hallway. The girls nodded to each other and smiled when they saw Nora pass by.

Nora returned the smile and waved, then continued on her way. Her boots clomped loudly as she walked, echoing off the walls. She paused outside the communal showers to check the time.

She was almost twenty minutes early for her shift, but there wasn't much point in rushing. She'd already missed too many shifts lately.

The showers were just past the end of the hall. Nora stepped inside, turned on the water, and waited while it warmed up. A few seconds later the hot water began to flow.

Nora stripped off her clothes and stepped into the shower stall, letting the warm water wash away the grime of the previous day. She leaned back against the wall, closing her eyes and relaxing.

The colony had been built on the edge of a cliff overlooking a vast sea of dust. The wind blew constantly, carrying grit with it. It was impossible to avoid being covered in dirt, and the only way to get clean was to bathe regularly.

Nora sighed as she scrubbed herself down, rinsing off the last of the grime and soap. She toweled off, then dressed again in her uniform before heading out.

She walked along the corridor toward the command center, where she would report to work. The hallways were dimly lit by emergency lighting, but Nora could see well enough. She passed several colonists who were already at their posts.

The corridors were long and straight, with no corners or turns to hide in. There was nothing to do but walk briskly. Nora tried not to think about the aliens lurking somewhere nearby.

At the end of the hall, a door opened onto the command center. Nora stepped inside, and the door slid shut behind her.

The room was large and square, with a windowless wall on one side. The floor was metal grating, and the walls were plated with metallic plates and conduits. A few chairs and tables sat scattered around the room.

Nora walked over to the front desk, which had an array of monitors and control panels. She checked the time and saw she'd arrived early.

""Good morning, Commander.""

Valentina Kern turned from her console to greet Nora. Valentina was tall and athletic, with dark hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. Her face was lined with scars and tattoos, and she wore a military uniform.

Nora nodded politely. ""Morning, Lieutenant.""

""You're late,"" Valentina said. ""I'm afraid you'll have to start your shift without me today.""

Nora frowned. ""But I've been here for hours. It's only—""

Valentina cut her off with a sharp gesture. ""No excuses. You know the drill. Get to work.""

She returned to her console and resumed typing commands.

123,0.3,0.4,1.0,77.0,5,48.0,"The dormitories were quiet, but not empty. The colonists slept in shifts, so there were always people around. Most of them were already awake, though, sitting at tables or standing by the windows to watch the sun rise over the distant mountains.

Nora walked past the rows of sleeping cots, heading for the communal kitchen. She passed the dining hall where she could smell the aroma of fresh coffee. At the end of the hall was a small lounge filled with couches and chairs. Nora sat down on one of the couches and waited for the coffee to finish brewing.

The kitchen was busy with the cooks preparing breakfast. A few colonists stood around, talking quietly, while others gathered their utensils and plates. Nora grabbed a mug of steaming black liquid from the counter and took it back to her couch. She sipped the hot drink as she watched the colonists prepare breakfast.

Nora felt a pang of envy when she saw how well-fed they looked. They ate like kings compared to her.

She gulped down the last of her coffee, then set the cup on a table and headed for the door. As she left the lounge, she glanced at the clock above the entrance. It read 7: 30 AM.

Nora paused in front of the door, feeling a twinge of uncertainty. She wasn't sure what to do. The colonists were already up and about. If she didn't get started soon, she wouldn't have time to make breakfast. But if she went out now, the colonists would see her leaving the dormitory and wonder why.

Nora sighed and pushed open the door.

The colony was quiet. Nora walked through the main concourse, which connected the dormitories to the command center and power plant. She passed a few colonists walking to work or heading to the cafeteria. Most of them ignored her, but a few gave her curious looks.

Nora reached the end of the concourse and turned right into a corridor. The corridor led to the engineering bays, where she could repair equipment.

She paused at the door to the first bay. It was a large room with several machines and tools lined up along one wall. A small group of colonists stood around the machines, chatting quietly. Nora recognized some of the faces from the lounge.

Nora stepped inside the bay and approached a woman who was working on an engine with a wrench. ""Hey, Lizzie,"" Nora said. ""You're up early.""

Lizzie looked up and smiled. She had short brown hair and bright green eyes. She wore a sleeveless shirt and utility pants.

""Yeah, I'm just getting started,"" she replied. ""I've been running diagnostics for half the night. It's a good thing you came in when you did. I was about to call it quits.""

Nora nodded. ""What do you need?""

""Just a second. Let me check the power levels on this generator.""

Lizzie walked over to a panel of gauges and dials set into the wall. She adjusted a few knobs, then turned back to Nora.

""All right.

124,0.3,0.4,1.0,86.0,5,48.0,"The hallway outside the dormitory was dim, but the lights were still on. The air smelled stale and musty, like the inside of a closet. A few colonists passed by in the hallways, their footsteps echoing off the walls.

Nora followed the sound of running water to the communal showers at the end of the hall. She turned right and entered the small room, where she found several other people already waiting for the showers to start.

The water was hot, and Nora let it run over her body to wash away the grime. She scrubbed her hair until it gleamed, then rinsed the last of the soap out of her eyes. She toweled herself dry, then dressed again.

She left the shower room, dried off with a towel, and walked back down the hall toward her quarters. She passed several more colonists heading in the opposite direction. They nodded to Nora as they went about their business.

Nora smiled and waved back. She felt good. The day ahead was going to be a challenge, but she knew how to handle it. She had been doing this for years now, and she was good at her job.

Nora returned to her quarters, changed into her work clothes, and headed out to the agricultural section. She passed a few colonists along the way, but none acknowledged her.

The colony's food production was vital. Without it, the colonists would starve. But the Company didn't provide enough food for everyone to eat. Instead, the Company provided only enough to feed its own employees and their families. The rest of the colonists were expected to do without.

The Company did not care what happened to them.

Nora walked through the corridors, passing several other colonists on her way to the greenhouses. She saw no one else in the halls. Most of the colonists worked during daylight hours, but Nora was scheduled to start her shift at nightfall.

She reached the greenhouse and entered. The air inside was warm and humid, like an oven. The plants were lush and healthy, their leaves glistening with moisture.

Nora pulled off her jacket, hung it over a nearby hook, and began to work. She was good at this kind of labor. She loved the outdoors, and she had learned how to grow things from scratch.

As she worked, she listened for any sounds outside the greenhouse. The colony was quiet. No alarms sounded, no voices called out. It seemed unnaturally still.

Nora finished up her task and stepped back. The plants were watered, fertilized, and tended to. Now it was time for the next step.

She walked to a large bin filled with seeds and carefully selected one. She carried it over to a small table, where she laid it down on a tray of moist soil. She then used a pair of tweezers to pluck the seedling from its container and place it in the tray.

125,0.3,0.4,1.0,79.0,3,44.0,"The colony's central power plant was located at its center, where the fusion reactor resided. The reactor was a large cylinder surrounded by support structures. A small, squat building sat next to it, housing the control room and engineering bays.

Nora walked past the dormitories, heading for the main concourse. She passed through the command center and the labs, then headed toward the garage.

She paused in front of the garage entrance, a wide door with heavy security locks and a thick metal grate. Nora looked up at the sky. The sun wasn't yet visible.

Nora sighed. She'd been awake for hours, but the time was still early enough that she could get some sleep if she hurried. She turned back to the door.

The garage had two levels, each with a dozen rows of lockers. Nora selected a locker near the bottom of the first level and opened it. She pulled out a set of work clothes, which were simple and practical.

Nora donned the work clothes and slipped on her boots. Then she grabbed a tool belt from another locker. The belt was made of tough, flexible material, and it held a variety of tools.

The last thing Nora needed before starting her shift was food. She headed for the cafeteria.

Nora entered the cafeteria through the double doors. It was a large room filled with tables and chairs, and a long counter lined with stools. The air smelled of fried foods, grease, and smoke.

Nora spotted a few other colonists milling around. She walked over to one table where an older man sat alone eating breakfast. He was dressed in a dark suit and tie, with his hair slicked back.

""Good morning,"" Nora said.

The man looked up at her with tired eyes. ""Morning.""

Nora nodded, then turned to leave.

""Wait!"" the man called after her. ""I'm sorry about the mess. I haven't had time to clean it yet.""

Nora paused and glanced back. The man gestured toward a nearby cleaning robot. ""You can use that if you want.""

Nora smiled. She'd been hoping for some help. ""Thanks.""

She started walking again, but the man called out to her. ""Hey, Nora! Wait up!""

Nora turned back. The man stood and waved her over. ""Come here a minute.""

Nora approached the table.

The man pointed at a chair. ""Sit down.""

Nora sat.

The man leaned forward on his elbows and stared at her. ""What's your name?""

""Nora Decker.""

He nodded. ""Well, Nora, I'm Dr. Jacobson. What do you think of this place?""

Nora frowned. ""It's... not bad.""

Dr. Jacobson nodded. ""I know. It looks like a dump, doesn't it? But we're doing our best to make it livable.""

""Are you the colony leader?""

Jacobson laughed. ""No. That would be Mr. Taggart. He's the CEO.""

Nora looked around. ""Where is he?""

""He's busy right now,"" Jacobson said. ""But you can talk to me if you want. I'm the chief medical officer.

126,0.3,0.4,1.0,90.0,5,44.0,"The hallways were dimly lit and empty, so she made good time to the cafeteria where she found a table in the back corner. She took a seat at one end of the small room while the other colonists trickled in.

The dining area was cramped but functional, with tables and chairs arranged in rows and a counter along the wall for serving food. The walls were painted white, the ceiling black, and the floor gray. A large window looked out over the colony grounds.

Nora sat down and waited for the others to arrive. She was early, but that wasn't unusual. Her shift started at seven o'clock. She'd been working since five.

A few minutes later, the door opened and two men entered. They walked to the front of the room and stood beside Nora's table. One man wore a dark blue uniform with a red stripe running down its chest. He had short blond hair and a square jawline. His companion was tall and slender, wearing a brown jumpsuit with a similar design.

""Good morning, everyone,"" the shorter man said. ""I'm Lieutenant Krell, the commander of this station. And you're...?""

Nora introduced herself. ""Nora Decker.""

""Valentina Kern,"" the taller man added. ""Commander Kern is our security chief and my second in command.""

Lieutenant Krell nodded at the introductions. ""Welcome aboard, Ms. Decker. I'll be your supervisor today.""

Nora's eyebrows lifted. ""Sir? You mean me?""

Krell grinned. ""You'll be working with us, so yes, you're my subordinate.""

Nora frowned at him. ""But...""

The lieutenant waved a hand dismissively. ""Don't worry about it. It's just an honorific. We don't have any rank here, so we use titles to make things clear. Just call me 'sir.' Everyone else does.""

Nora blinked. She hadn't expected such a casual attitude from the commander of a colony. But then, Commander Kern was a veteran of the interstellar navy. She'd seen her share of combat and probably expected no less than military protocol.

""Okay,"" Nora said with a nod. ""Sir.""

""Good."" Lieutenant Krell turned his attention back to the other colonists. ""Now, let's get started. I've got some work for you all today.""

Nora watched him walk away. He seemed like a nice enough guy, but he didn't seem too interested in getting to know the people working under him. Not that she blamed him. The commander was busy, and he had a lot of responsibilities.

She glanced around the room. Most of the colonists were already seated. A few others were still coming in. She wondered if they knew what their jobs would be.

Nora looked down at her plate. It wasn't much. Just a bowl of cereal with milk and a slice of toast, which she'd eaten before leaving the dormitory. She felt hungry again now, but not for food.

127,0.3,0.4,1.0,89.0,3,42.0,"The colony's corridors were lined with doors to rooms where colonists slept and ate. The hallways were long, straight, and dimly lit. They stretched off in both directions, curving around the central concourse.

Nora passed by a few other people on her way to the cafeteria. One man was already there, sitting at the counter and reading a book. He looked up when she approached, but didn't say anything.

She walked past him to the end of the corridor. A door opened to the left. Nora peered inside. It was a small room with two beds, one of which was unoccupied. She nodded at it as she turned back toward the cafeteria.

Nora entered the cafeteria through a wide doorway. The room was large, with several tables arranged in rows along the walls. At each table sat a single person, eating breakfast. Nora spotted her own empty seat and made for it.

A young woman who appeared to be in her early twenties glanced up from the food on her plate, then returned to her meal. She wore a simple white blouse and dark slacks. Her hair was short and blonde, and she had green eyes.

Nora slid into the chair across from her. ""Good morning.""

The other girl didn't respond. She continued to eat.

""I'm Nora,"" said Nora. ""You don't know me, but I work here. You're new, right?""

Still no response.

Nora sighed. ""Look, I know you've got your reasons for not talking to me. But if we can just get along, I'll do my best to help you out. Can I call you Tanya? It's a nice name.""

Tanya didn't look up. Nora could see her jaw working as she chewed on something. She swallowed and set down her fork.

""Okay, fine,"" said Nora. ""Whatever. Just tell me what's going on. I'll try to understand. Why won't you talk to me?""

Tanya looked up at last, her face pale and drawn. She stared at Nora with wide eyes.

Nora frowned. ""What is it? What's wrong?""

The girl blinked rapidly several times before answering. ""My name isn't Tanya.""

""Oh,"" said Nora. ""Sorry. I thought...""

""It's a fake name,"" said Tanya.

Nora nodded slowly. ""I see. Well, I'm Nora. I'm an engineer. I work on the colony's equipment.""

""I know who you are,"" said Tanya.

Nora sat back. ""Really?""

Tanya shrugged. ""You're famous.""

Nora laughed. ""Famous? Me? For what?""

""For fixing things.""

Nora's eyes widened. ""That's not true!""

Tanya smiled thinly. ""I've seen you on vids, Nora. You're a hero.""

Nora found a table near the back of the room and took a seat. She watched the other diners, who seemed to be mostly men. They wore the same utilitarian clothing Nora did, though their jackets were less durable and their trousers more colorful.

She looked around for someone to talk to. Her gaze fell on a young woman sitting alone at another table with her head down over a plate. Nora recognized the girl from the day before, but didn't know her name.

""Hi,"" Nora said as she approached the table. ""I'm Nora.""

The girl lifted her face. She was pretty, with dark hair cut short in a bob. Her eyes were brown and wide open, staring into space.

""You're new here?"" Nora asked.

The girl nodded.

""What's your name?""

""Sophie.""

Nora smiled. ""Nice to meet you, Sophie. I'm Nora. What are you doing up so early? You should be asleep like everyone else.""

The girl shook her head. ""No way. This is my first shift. I've been awake since five this morning.""

Nora frowned. ""Why?""

""I don't know.""

""Well, it's not going to get any better than this. I'll tell you what—you can have breakfast with me if you want. It won't be much, but I could use some company.""

""Really?""

""Sure. Come on. Let's go.""

Nora led the girl out of the cafeteria and down a long corridor. The other colonists glanced at them as they passed, but no one spoke. Nora wondered why.

They walked through the colony until they reached a small service area where several doors opened off the hallway. Nora pointed toward a door marked 'Engineering'.

""This way,"" she said.

The girl followed her inside. Nora pushed open another door and stepped into an empty room with a single desk and chair. She gestured for Sophie to sit down, then sat herself behind the desk.

""So... what do you think about this place?"" Nora asked.

Sophie shrugged. ""It's okay.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah? Well, we're not so bad either. We've got our problems, but we work together to fix them.""

""What kind of problems?""

""Oh, you know. The usual stuff. Food shortages, power outages, equipment malfunctions. Stuff like that.""

The girl frowned. ""But why would anyone build a colony here? It's so far away from everything else.""

""That's what I'm trying to figure out,"" Nora said. ""We've been here for years, and it still doesn't make sense. Why are we the only ones who can see this planet?""

Sophie shook her head.

Nora walked briskly through the dim halls, eager to get to breakfast. Her boots clomped on the metal floors, echoing loudly in the stillness. She stopped at the end of one corridor to check her watch.

She was running late.

Nora hurried down the hall, passing several doors. As she neared the cafeteria, the sound of voices grew louder. She slowed her pace, listening for the words.

""... just a little longer,"" someone said. ""I'm sure we'll find something.""

""You're right, it's probably nothing,"" another voice replied. ""But I want to be safe.""

Nora paused outside the door, trying to hear more. The voices were muffled, but they sounded like two men. One was older than the other.

The younger man spoke again. ""We've been here for weeks now. We can't keep going on this way. It's not safe anymore.""

""It'll have to be enough until the next supply ship arrives. Then we'll know what we need to do.""

Nora pressed her ear to the door and strained to listen.

""What are you talking about?"" The older man asked. ""The Company's already sent us a new team of engineers. They should be here any day now. You don't have to worry about it, okay? Just focus on getting through today.""

Nora heard a sigh. ""I'm sorry, but I think we're done waiting. If we don't get some help soon, there's no telling how long we'll last.""

""Don't be stupid,"" the older man said sharply. ""We'll find something to fix it. Now come on, let's go eat. I'm starving.""

Nora stepped back from the door. She'd heard enough. The men were arguing over whether or not to leave.

She turned away and continued down the corridor.

The cafeteria was empty except for one man sitting at a table near the back. He wore a dark suit with a white shirt and tie. His eyes were red and puffy, his face pale and haggard.

He looked up when he saw Nora. ""Good morning,"" he said.

""Morning."" Nora nodded politely. ""You're late.""

The man stood and walked toward her, holding out a hand. ""My name is Robert. I'm the colony's chief engineer.""

Nora took his hand. ""Nora. I'm an engineer too.""

""I know. You're the best engineer we have.""

""Thanks,"" Nora said, smiling. She shook his hand firmly. ""So what happened?""

Robert sighed. ""It's the power plant. We've been having problems since we got here.""

Nora frowned. ""What kind of problems?""

""The reactor won't shut off. It just keeps running.""

Nora's frown deepened. ""That sounds serious. What are you doing about it?""

""I'm trying to figure out why. I've tried everything. But nothing works.""

The colony's corridors were narrow, utilitarian, and functional. They had no windows, so the only illumination came from the emergency lighting.

She passed a few colonists on their way to work, but they ignored her as she walked briskly toward the mess hall. She was just about to turn the corner when something caught her eye.

A man stood at the end of the hallway. He wore a dark suit, white shirt, and tie. His hair was slicked back, and he held himself with military precision. But his eyes were wide open and staring straight ahead.

Nora stopped short, her heart pounding. She had never seen anyone look like that. The man didn't blink or move. He stared at nothing.

The man looked right through Nora.

He didn't seem to notice her.

Nora took a step forward, then another. She felt as if her feet weren't touching the floor. Her pulse raced in her ears. The man's gaze was fixed on something far away, and Nora couldn't tell what it was.

The man didn't react to the sound of her footsteps.

Nora's breath caught in her throat. The man continued to stare straight ahead.

Nora moved closer, her hands shaking. She reached out to touch the man's shoulder. His skin was cold and clammy.

His eyes were glassy and empty.

Nora tried again, this time reaching up to grab his face. The man jerked his head back as if he'd been shocked.

She grabbed his shoulders and shook him hard, but he didn't respond. He just stared at her with those dead eyes.

Nora dropped to her knees beside him. She clasped both of his hands and pressed them to her cheeks, trying to warm them. She could feel the chill radiating off his body.

""Hey,"" she said. ""It's okay.""

The man didn't react. He still stared straight ahead, unblinking.

Nora felt a surge of panic. She had to get him back to the infirmary. She needed help. But how? The man was frozen in place.

Nora looked around for something to use as a weapon. A piece of metal or an instrument. Anything would do. She found nothing.

Then she saw the knife on the floor at her feet. It was a short, thick blade with a serrated edge. Nora picked it up and held it in front of her.

The man didn't react.

Nora gripped the handle tightly. The knife felt good in her hand, solid and heavy. She took another step toward the man.

He didn't move.

Nora stepped closer. She raised the knife and brought it down hard, stabbing the tip into the man's chest.

His eyes snapped open. He jerked his head up, staring at her with wide, terrified eyes.

Nora gasped and dropped the knife. She backed away from him, shaking. Her heart pounded in her ears. The man's gaze was wild and feral. His mouth opened, but no sound came out.

Nora stumbled backward until she hit the wall. She turned and ran.

Nora walked briskly through the halls, passing other colonists in their own rooms. Most of them slept soundly, but she saw several people awake and moving about.

She passed the cafeteria, where two men sat eating. One was a tall, lanky man with dark hair and skin. He wore a long sleeved shirt over his thin frame and loose trousers. His companion was short and stocky with curly brown hair and a beard. They both looked up as Nora approached, but neither spoke.

Nora ignored them and continued on. She found the mess hall, which was empty except for a few workers cleaning tables. A young woman with red hair stood behind the counter, watching Nora approach. She smiled when Nora entered.

""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied automatically. ""I'm going to eat breakfast now.""

The girl nodded and turned back to her work. Nora left the mess hall and headed down the corridor toward the power plant, which was located near the center of the colony. She stopped at the door, then hesitated.

Nora had never been inside the power plant before. The door opened into a large room filled with machinery and pipes. It smelled like an engine shop. Nora stepped cautiously through the doorway, trying not to touch anything.

A man in a white lab coat sat on a stool next to one of the machines. He was hunched over something with his hands resting on top of it. Nora watched him for a moment, wondering if he would notice her. When the man didn't look up, she walked closer and peered over his shoulder.

He was examining a device with a screen. On the screen were images of wires, circuits, and circuitry. Nora recognized the components as those used in the power plant's fusion reactor.

""Morning, Dr. Chen,"" Nora said.

The man looked up at her and smiled. ""Good morning, Nora. I see you've come to visit me.""

Nora nodded. ""I was hoping for some breakfast. Do you have any food?""

Dr. Chen shook his head. ""No, but there are several places nearby where you can get something."" He gestured toward the door behind him.

""Thanks,"" Nora replied and left the power plant. She passed a few colonists on her way out, but none of them spoke to her.

The colonists had their own ways. They knew how to keep secrets.

Nora walked down the corridor, heading for the cafeteria. As she approached the mess hall, she heard voices coming from inside. She stopped and listened. The voices sounded like they were arguing.

The hallways were narrow, the ceilings low, and the floors uneven. She walked carefully, avoiding tripping over protruding pipes and conduits.

Nora paused at the end of the hallway to glance back the way she had come. Her room was in the far corner, near the power plant. In the distance, the fusion reactor glowed like a distant star, casting long shadows across the ground.

She turned the corner and headed down the next hallway. A few colonists passed her, heading to their jobs. She waved to them, but they didn't respond. They were too busy with their own concerns.

Nora's boots clacked loudly on the metal floor as she made her way through the colony. She kept her head down, trying not to trip over anything in the dark. When she reached the command center, she entered and found it empty.

Nora sighed, relieved that no one was around to witness her disheveled appearance. She stepped into a nearby conference room and sat in the chair nearest the door. The room had been set up for meetings, but now it was just an abandoned waiting area. She pulled out her tablet and began tapping away at the screen while she waited.

The tablet was a sleek device with a curved display surface. It was designed to be worn on the wrist, and it fit snugly over her hand. Its touch screen was responsive enough to allow her to type without looking down at the keys.

Nora tapped the screen idly until her tablet chirped. She glanced up and saw a message from the Company's executive officer.

""Good morning, Nora.""

A voice spoke in her ear. ""Hello, sir,"" she replied.

""I have some news about your next assignment. You'll be working with Dr. Rios on the planet's surface. He'll brief you when he arrives.""

Nora nodded.

""We're sending a supply ship to pick you up today. I'm sure you've heard of the colony's problems. We can't afford to lose any more personnel, so we need to get this done quickly. Your job is to help the colonists keep their equipment running.""

""Yes, sir,"" she said.

""You'll be working with the team that has been assigned to the power plant. They should arrive in a few hours. Please make sure they know where to find you.""

""Yes, sir.""

The connection ended. Nora stared at the blank screen for a moment before returning her attention to the tablet.

She was going back out into the cold.

Nora had no idea what she would do if she got stuck out there again. She'd spent most of her life in Presley's Promise, but the colony was isolated and far from any other human settlement. The nearest habitable planet was three days away by shuttle, and even then it was only a barren rock with no signs of intelligent life.

133,0.3,0.5,1.0,86.0,4,42.0,"Outside, she found the colony's central hub filled with people. The colonists were already at work, busy with their morning chores. Some worked in the fields, others labored over machinery, while still others gathered supplies from the stores.

Nora spotted Sully standing beside a large, bulky power loader. He wore a dark blue uniform, complete with peaked cap and insignia. His eyes widened when he saw Nora approaching.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said cheerfully. ""You're up early.""

""I'm not the only one,"" Nora replied with a smile. ""What time do you start?""

Sully laughed. ""Not until noon, but I've got my own work to get done first.""

Nora nodded. ""How long have you been here?""

""About three months now. They sent me down with a team of engineers. We're trying to fix some of the older equipment, but it's slow going. It's a lot easier to just build new stuff than try to repair old junk.""

Nora smiled wryly. ""That sounds about right.""

""And you? How's your project coming along?""

Nora shrugged. ""Slow. But we'll make it work.""

Sully nodded. ""I know how it is. You can't rush perfection, but if you don't finish soon, the Company will send someone else. And they'll probably be worse at this job.""

""Yeah,"" Nora agreed. ""They'll probably be worse at everything.""

Sully chuckled. ""At least you're not stuck on the surface. I'd rather work down here than spend my days in a suit."" He gestured toward his uniform. ""The suits are for emergencies, and there's no reason to wear them when you're working outside.""

""I guess you're right,"" Nora said. She glanced around the hub. ""So where do you go after work?""

""To the mess hall. There's a good place to get breakfast.""

Nora nodded. ""Sounds like a plan.""

Sully grinned. ""See you later, Nora.""

""Bye, Sully.""

She watched him walk away, then turned her attention to the people milling about. The colonists were a diverse group, from humans of various ethnicities, to aliens with strange, colorful skin tones, to one or two who looked more human than not.

Nora was surprised by how many of the colonists had dark hair. It wasn't common among the Company's employees, but it seemed to be fairly popular among the colony's residents.

Most of the colonists wore utilitarian clothing. Some wore uniforms, while others wore jumpsuits. Nora spotted a few women wearing dresses. She wondered what their purpose was. Was it just for show? Or did they have some other function?

Nora's curiosity piqued, she wandered over to the nearest woman in a dress. She was tall and slender with long black hair pulled back into a ponytail. Her face was pale and angular, her eyes bright green. Nora couldn't tell if she was young or old.

She stopped beside the woman and asked, ""What's your name?""

The woman blinked at Nora, then smiled faintly. ""I'm Eileen. What's yours?""

",-0.1719387755102038,-0.20795918367346855,0.01612244897959192
134,0.3,0.5,1.0,87.0,4,48.0,"The air outside was crisp and cold, but she welcomed the chill as it stung her eyes and cleared her head. The sky above the colony was a deep blue, streaked with wisps of white cloud.

She walked down the hall to the communal kitchen, where several colonists were already eating breakfast. A few glanced at her, but most ignored her. She was just another engineer, one of many. Nora nodded to the woman sitting next to the door to the dining room and went in.

The kitchen had been designed to be efficient and easy to use. The food dispensers were self-serve, so there was no need to wait for someone else to get up. But the food was bland and tasteless, and the coffee tasted like it came from a vending machine.

Nora sat down at the table, which creaked under her weight as she lowered herself onto the hard plastic surface. She picked up a cup of watery coffee and took a sip. It was too hot and bitter, but it would have to do.

A couple of colonists were talking in low voices near the entrance to the dining area. Nora recognized the man as Sully Carmichael, the colony's administrator. He was a big man with an affable smile and dark hair graying at the temples. He wore a gray suit over a white shirt, and his tie was red and black.

Sully was speaking to the woman who had been sitting next to the door. She was dressed in a long skirt and blouse, and her brown hair was pulled back into a tight bun. Nora couldn't see her face because of the way she was hunched forward over the table.

Nora sipped her coffee and waited for them to finish their conversation. As they did, she noticed a small group of colonists gathered around the far end of the room. They were talking in hushed tones and looking at something on one of the tables.

The colonists'conversation stopped when Nora entered the kitchen. Everyone turned toward her, including Sully and the woman.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm sorry I'm late."" She set down her coffee cup.

""No problem, Nora. We're just finishing breakfast. Would you like some?"" Sully asked.

Nora shook her head. ""Not right now. Thanks, though.""

Sully nodded and resumed his conversation with the woman. The colonists returned to eating breakfast.

Nora walked over to the table where the others were standing. She recognized the young man who had been talking to Sully from somewhere before, but couldn't place him. He was tall and lanky, with dark hair and a thin mustache. His eyes were blue and intelligent, and he wore a gray shirt and pants over black boots.

""Morning, Nora,"" the man said.

She smiled. ""Hello, Felix. How are you doing today?""

Felix shrugged. ""Fine. You?""

Nora glanced at the table. ""I'm okay. What's going on here?""

""We found something,"" the man said. He gestured at the table. ""There were some papers. We thought we'd better look into it.""

Nora looked down at the table.

135,0.3,0.5,1.0,86.0,3,44.0,"The corridors were silent as she made her way to the mess hall. The colony's power plant hummed in the background, but the lights were off. A few dimly lit windows cast faint illumination over the halls, but the rest of the complex was dark.

Nora passed several colonists who sat at tables in their pajamas, eating bowls of cereal and drinking cups of coffee. They glanced up when she walked past, but didn't say anything. Nora kept going, following the path to the mess hall.

The doors slid open for her with a hiss as she approached. Inside, the room was filled with the sounds of clinking utensils and chewing. Nora took a seat near the back, where she could see the door.

A man who looked like he'd been sleeping in his clothes came over to greet her. He wore a faded green shirt and gray trousers that had seen better days. His hair was mussed and unkempt, and his face bore stubble.

""Morning,"" he said. ""I'm Raul.""

Nora nodded. ""Good morning.""

Raul sat down across from her, setting a bowl of oatmeal in front of him. ""You're the engineer?""

Nora nodded again.

""What's your name?""

""Nora.""

""Nora what?""

""Just Nora."" She shrugged, not wanting to give away any more information than necessary.

Raul smiled. ""That's a nice name. I'm Raul. What do you think about the colony so far?""

Nora frowned. ""It's... different. It's hard to explain, but it feels like we're living in a big box with no walls or ceiling. The whole place is just one giant room.""

""Yeah, I can see that,"" Raul said. ""We've got a lot of open space. But the colonists have been complaining about how cramped everything gets after a while. We need to figure out some way to expand our quarters.""

""How many people live here?"" Nora asked.

""Thirty-seven.""

Nora blinked at him. ""Thirty-seven? That's a small number for this kind of colony.""

Raul shrugged. ""The Company doesn't care about us. They don't even send supplies anymore. So we're on our own, but we still get paid.""

Nora nodded slowly. ""I guess that makes sense. You'd want to keep your employees happy and healthy.""

""Exactly,"" Raul said. He picked up his spoon, then paused. ""Are you sure you're okay with working here?""

""Yes,"" Nora replied. She didn't know why he was asking her that, but she wasn't going to let him intimidate her.

Raul looked down at the bowl of oatmeal in front of him. ""You're not claustrophobic or anything, are you?""

Nora shook her head. ""No.""

""Good."" Raul took a bite of oatmeal and chewed it thoughtfully. ""We've got a lot of work ahead of us today.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, I can see that.""

""Do you have any questions?""

Nora hesitated. ""What do you mean, 'work'?""

Raul smiled.

136,0.3,0.5,1.0,86.0,3,46.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by small lights set in the ceiling. The walls were made from dark gray metal plates, each one a foot wide and as tall as she was. The floor was covered in thick black rubber mats. She could feel the heat radiating up through her boots.

Nora walked down the hallway, passing doors on both sides. Most of the rooms were empty, but a few had people inside. Some colonists were already awake and working, while others slept.

Nora paused at the end of the hall to check the time displayed on her wristwatch. She was running late.

She hurried down the next corridor, then turned left into another long row of identical rooms. Most of the rooms were vacant, but a few were occupied. Nora passed one room where two men sat in chairs facing each other across a table, talking quietly. They glanced up as she approached, and their eyes widened.

Nora smiled and waved. ""Good morning.""

""Morning,"" the man on the right said. He had a thin face with dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His companion was taller, with a broad, square jaw and a close-cropped haircut.

""I'm Nora. I'll be your engineer today. How are you?""

The two exchanged glances, then the bearded man spoke. ""Fine. We're good. Thanks for asking.""

Nora nodded. ""Have a nice day."" She walked on, leaving them behind.

Nora turned left again and continued down the hallway. She passed several more rooms before reaching the cafeteria. The room was large, and it had been designed to look like an old-fashioned diner. It had a counter along one wall with stools, and tables set up in rows along the opposite side. A large window looked out over the grounds.

A few colonists were already there, eating breakfast. Nora took a seat at the end of the nearest table and waited until someone came over.

The woman who approached her was short and slender with dark brown hair pulled back into a ponytail. Her eyes were green and her skin was pale. She wore a sleeveless shirt and utility pants, but Nora could see the outline of a gun holster under her jacket.

""Hi,"" she said. ""I'm Nora.""

The woman nodded. ""My name's Jana. I'll be your assistant today.""

Nora smiled. ""Nice to meet you. Did you sleep well?""

Jana shook her head. ""No, not really. But I'll get through it."" She paused. ""You're the engineer? You'll fix our equipment?""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm an engineer, yes. But I can't do everything.""

""That's okay,"" Jana said. ""We'll manage. We've got a lot of work to do today.""

Nora nodded. ""Let me know if you need anything. And don't worry about the equipment. It'll be fine."" She glanced around at the other colonists. ""Are we ready for breakfast?""

137,0.3,0.5,1.0,62.0,3,42.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists still asleep. The air smelled stale, but fresh from the showers.

Nora walked briskly down the hallway, passing several doors as she passed them. She paused at each door to check if anyone was inside. No one was.

She reached the end of the corridor and turned right, heading toward the cafeteria. Her boots clacked on the metal grating that covered the floor. As she walked, the sound echoed off the walls. Nora kept her eyes forward, watching for the occasional drone lurking in the shadows.

The cafeteria was large enough to hold hundreds of colonists. It had a long counter with stools along the wall, where the colonists ate their meals. Nora walked past the counter, then stopped when she saw a familiar face.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""I thought you'd be up.""

""Nora!"" Ayliss looked up from her breakfast. She wore a blue jumpsuit and a white scarf tied around her head. ""You're early! I didn't expect you until later.""

""Yeah, well..."" Nora trailed off. She was surprised to see Ayliss looking so tired. The woman's hair hung limp and disheveled, and she looked haggard.

Nora knew Ayliss was a good engineer, but she hadn't expected the woman to look like this.

Ayliss set her fork down with a clatter. ""Are you okay?"" she asked. ""Did something happen last night? You haven't been sleeping very well, have you?""

""No, it's nothing."" Nora shook her head. ""It's just... I'm not used to working nights. It makes me feel tired.""

""Well, don't worry about it. We'll get through today and tomorrow will be easier,"" Ayliss said. ""We've got a lot of work ahead of us. And you're doing great.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks. I'll try.""

""Good."" Ayliss stood and stretched, then walked over to the counter. She leaned on it, watching Nora. ""How do you like your eggs?""

""Scrambled.""

Ayliss nodded. ""Same here. Want some toast with that?""

Nora shook her head. ""I'll grab something later.""

""Okay. See ya,"" Ayliss said, turning away. She headed back toward the kitchen.

Nora watched her go, then turned and started walking again.

The cafeteria was a wide room filled with tables. The colonists ate at long wooden benches along the walls. Nora passed several groups of people eating breakfast, but none of them were Ayliss.

She found an empty table near the far wall. A few other colonists sat there already. Nora took a seat and waited for someone to come take her order.

A man approached her table. He wore a white shirt, black pants, and boots. His face was clean shaven and his dark hair was short and neat.

""Hi,"" he said. ""What can I get you?""

""Um..."" Nora looked around, trying to find Ayliss. ""I'm waiting for my friend.""

138,0.3,0.5,1.0,84.0,5,44.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by glow strips. The lights were set to come on at nightfall, but they never quite did. Nora walked past the dormitories and engineering bays, stopping briefly in front of the mess hall.

The dining room was a large open area filled with tables and chairs. A few colonists sat around eating, while others worked on their own meals. Nora grabbed a tray and headed for the food line. She picked up a plate and loaded it with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and orange juice.

She was halfway through the meal when she heard the first drone. Nora froze with her fork poised over her plate. Her heart pounded.

A second later, the sound came again. This time, Nora recognized the chirping of a mechanical alarm. She dropped her utensils and bolted from the table.

Nora ran down the corridor, heading towards the control center. The colony's alarms were supposed to be loud enough that everyone could hear them. But this one sounded muffled and distant.

She reached the command center just in time to see a swarm of drones emerge from the darkness. They flew in tight formation, like an arrowhead aimed at her. Nora darted into the nearest doorway and slammed it shut behind her.

The door was reinforced and locked. She pressed herself against the wall and waited for the drones to pass. The sound of their wings was deafening, but they didn't pause or slow down.

Nora took a deep breath and held it. She counted silently in her head. One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten.

When she finished counting, Nora let out a long, steady breath. She turned around and looked up at the closed door. It would take more than a few drones to get through it.

She walked back down the corridor to the mess hall, where she ate her breakfast. When she was done, she grabbed another tray and returned to the control center.

The drones had passed. Nora slipped inside and headed for the armory. The weapon racks were set along the walls, each holding a variety of firearms. Nora selected a rifle and loaded it with ammunition before heading back to her quarters.

She changed into her work clothes and grabbed her toolkit, then went to the engineering bay.

The bay was filled with equipment and tools. A large monitor on one wall displayed schematics of the colony. She picked up a wrench and began working on a malfunctioning power loader.

Nora was focused and efficient. Her hands moved quickly over the controls, but she never lost focus. She didn't even look up when a drone flew overhead.

A moment later, the alarm sounded again. Nora dropped her wrench and ran in the opposite direction from the drones.

She reached the command center just in time to see a swarm of drones emerge from the darkness. They flew in tight formation, like an arrowhead aimed at her. Nora darted into the nearest doorway and slammed it shut behind her.

The door was reinforced and locked. She pressed herself against the wall and waited for the drones to pass.

139,0.3,0.6,1.0,71.0,4,43.0,"The halls were empty. The colonists still slept, so she headed for the cafeteria.

The hallways were dimly lit by recessed lights. A few of them had been vandalized, their glass shattered and the wiring exposed. Nora paused at the first one to peer inside.

A man lay sprawled on the floor, his head twisted at an unnatural angle. His face was swollen, blackened, and split open, revealing a bloody mess of broken bones beneath. Blood pooled around him in a dark pool.

Nora shuddered. She couldn't remember the last time she'd seen anything like this. But then, she didn't have to see it. She knew what happened when colonists died in the colony's dormitories.

She hurried past the scene, her boots clacking on the metal grating as she moved down the corridor. Her stomach rumbled and she glanced over her shoulder with a grimace. She needed food more than sleep, but she wasn't about to go back to her quarters for breakfast.

The cafeteria was empty except for two men sitting near the door. They looked up as Nora approached, and one of them stood.

""Hey,"" he said. ""You're new.""

""Yeah,"" she replied. ""I'm Nora. I just started today.""

""Oh, right. Welcome to the crew. You'll be working with me on the power plant. My name's Alex. What's yours?""

Nora hesitated. She hadn't expected anyone else to show up for breakfast.

Alex was tall and lean, his brown hair cut short. He wore a dark gray uniform shirt and pants. His eyes were bright blue and alert. He had a friendly smile, but Nora sensed an edge of tension in him.

""Nora,"" she answered.

""Well, you'll be working with us on the power plant. We've got a lot of work to do before we can get it running again.""

""That's right,"" she agreed. ""I'll need to check out the reactor first thing.""

""Good idea. Let's go.""

They walked together toward the cafeteria, and Nora followed Alex through the door.

The room was large enough to hold hundreds of colonists. It was filled with tables and chairs arranged in a grid pattern, but only half of them were occupied. The other half were empty.

A few people sat at the tables, their heads bowed over plates. Others stood around the walls, staring into space or talking quietly among themselves.

Nora looked around. She didn't see any sign of the man who'd been killed outside her quarters. But then, she hadn't seen anyone else since coming to this colony either.

She turned back to Alex and asked, ""Where's everyone?""

""They're all dead.""

Nora stared at him in shock.

""What? How did they die?""

""We don't know yet,"" he said. ""But we think it's something like the flu. A virus, maybe.""

""How many died?"" she asked.

Alex shrugged. ""All of them. Everyone in the dormitories is gone.""

Nora felt a chill. She remembered the man lying on the floor outside her quarters.

140,0.3,0.6,1.0,76.0,5,49.0,"The hallway was dimly lit by a few lights overhead, but Nora could see well enough to navigate without stumbling over anything. The colony's layout was simple. She followed the hallways until she reached the cafeteria at the end, where the smell of fresh coffee filled the air.

Nora paused in front of the door to the cafeteria and took a deep breath. This was the first time she'd been allowed out since her arrival. Her stomach rumbled, reminding her that she hadn't eaten yet.

She opened the door to find a long line of people waiting for food. Nora joined them, relieved when she spotted a familiar face behind one of the serving counters.

""Good morning,"" Nora said cheerfully. ""I'm looking forward to my breakfast.""

The woman smiled back at her, but didn't say anything. Nora wondered if the woman had heard her. She looked tired and worn out from working so hard.

Nora watched as the woman ladled out a bowl of oatmeal and put it in front of her. As Nora sat down, the woman handed her a spoon.

""Thanks,"" Nora said with a smile. She dug into the oatmeal, which was surprisingly good.

The woman nodded, then turned away to serve someone else. Nora finished eating quickly, but lingered at the table for a moment before leaving. The cafeteria was busy, and she found herself drawn to the counter again.

She stared at the array of food laid out there, trying to decide what she wanted. Nora's stomach growled loudly, and she realized she'd been standing in front of the same plate for too long.

""Excuse me,"" Nora said to the woman behind the counter. ""I think I'll have some eggs.""

The woman nodded, and Nora took a seat at one of the tables. She waited patiently while the woman scrambled eggs and fried them up in the pan. The eggs were delicious, and Nora ate three more before she was full.

""Thank you!"" Nora said, smiling.

The woman smiled back, but didn't say anything.

Nora left the cafeteria and walked down the hallway toward her quarters. She passed several other colonists on the way, but none of them spoke to her.

She was glad when she reached her room. Nora stepped inside, shut the door behind her, and leaned against it. She breathed deeply, trying to calm her nerves.

The colony had been attacked twice in the last few months. Both times, Nora had been caught off guard and nearly killed. She wasn't sure how much longer she could keep herself alive.

Nora sighed. Her shift started in half an hour. She needed to get ready.

She stripped out of her clothes and pulled on a fresh set of utility pants and shirt, then grabbed her work boots from the closet and put them on. She picked up the jacket and held it up to the light. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years.

Nora frowned.

141,0.3,0.6,1.0,83.0,5,42.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by a few lights spaced far apart along its length. The walls were covered in a dull, metallic material, giving the place a utilitarian feel. A few colonists walked past her, their footsteps echoing off the walls.

She passed through the main entrance hall, where the colony's only security guard stood at attention. She nodded to him without speaking, then continued on down the long, straight hallway that led to the cafeteria.

Nora entered the cafeteria and found it empty. Her stomach rumbled. She grabbed a tray from the stack near the door, filled it with food, and headed for the nearest table.

The cafeteria was modern and well-equipped. It had been designed to be comfortable and inviting, but the interior design was austere. The tables were made of sturdy metal with a single chair per seat. The chairs were simple and functional.

Nora sat down and started eating, her eyes scanning the room as she shoveled food into her mouth. She was halfway through her meal when a man in a dark suit approached her table. He wore a tie, but no jacket. His hair was slicked back and his face was clean shaven.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm Captain Valentina Kern.""

Nora swallowed, then nodded. She set her fork down on the plate. ""Yes, ma'am. I'm Nora Decker. You're looking for me?""

Valentina smiled. She had a strong jawline and an angular nose that gave her a hawkish look. Her eyes were a piercing blue, and her skin was pale white. She looked more like a soldier than a civilian.

""You are the colony's best engineer, correct? I need your help.""

Nora frowned. ""What kind of help do you need?""

""We have a problem with our communications equipment. It has been malfunctioning for several days now. We've tried everything we can think of, but nothing works. We need someone who knows how to fix it.""

Nora nodded. She finished her breakfast and pushed the tray away. ""All right. Let me get my tools.""

She stood up and walked out of the cafeteria. Valentina followed her. They passed through another corridor, then entered a large room filled with rows of machinery. Nora stopped at the first row of workbenches and pulled down a toolbox.

Valentina watched her as she rummaged around in the box, pulling out various pieces of equipment. She selected a wrench and a pair of pliers from the assortment of tools.

""I'll be back in half an hour,"" Nora said. ""If you want me to start working on the problem, I need to know what's broken.""

""Of course."" Valentina nodded. ""Please don't take too long. We're running low on supplies. We'll need your help if we're going to make it through this winter.""

Nora smiled. ""Don't worry, ma'am. I'll get to it.""

Valentina left the room and returned to the cafeteria. She sat down and waited for Nora to finish her breakfast.

Nora emerged from the room and started walking toward the exit. Valentina followed her. They walked past the security guard, who saluted them both.

Nora walked past the cafeteria, where she could smell the aroma of fresh coffee wafting through the air. She paused at the door to the command center, glancing back over her shoulder at the closed door behind her.

She entered the room and sat down at the console. A holographic display showed the layout of the colony, including the location of every person on the planet. Nora tapped her fingers across the touch screen, scrolling through the list of names.

The comm panel beeped, startling her out of her thoughts. She answered it with a curt ""Yes?""

""Engineer Decker,"" said the voice on the other end. ""You're needed in the command center.""

Nora sighed. ""I'm on my way.""

The holograph of the colony map faded away. Nora stood and headed for the door. She passed the cafeteria again, this time with a full plate in hand.

Nora ate quickly, washing down her food with a mug of hot coffee. As she finished eating, she heard the clatter of boots outside the door. She walked out into the hall to find Sully waiting for her.

He was dressed in a dark blue uniform, his hair neatly combed and slicked back. His face was freshly shaved and he wore a thin smile. Nora's stomach twisted at the sight of him.

""Good morning, Engineer,"" he said. ""Did you sleep well?""

She nodded absently. Nora felt her eyes start to burn. She blinked furiously, trying to clear her vision. ""What do you want?""

Sully stepped closer. ""I thought we could talk about your work. I know how hard you've been working lately.""

Nora's hands curled into fists at her sides. ""I don't have time for this.""

""We need you here, Nora. We can use your skills,"" said Sully.

Nora clenched her teeth. ""I'm not a babysitter. You're wasting my time.""

Sully's expression hardened. ""You are a valuable member of this colony. If you were to leave, who would take your place?""

Nora stared at him. She didn't answer. Sully sighed.

""I'll be honest with you, Nora. The Company is having trouble keeping up with our production schedule. We're running out of resources. Our supplies will run out in a few months. We need to get more from the planet if we want to keep going.""

Nora's eyes narrowed. ""How much do you need?""

Sully smiled thinly. ""A lot, actually. Enough to make it worth your while.""

Nora's hands balled into fists. She took a deep breath and forced herself to relax. ""What do you want me to do?""

Sully shrugged. ""It's not really my decision. I just need you to help us out. We'll pay you well.""

Nora shook her head. ""I don't care about money.""

""You should,"" said Sully. He stepped closer. ""We can offer you a job. A good one. You could be the colony's chief engineer. Or maybe even its CEO. It's up to you.""

143,0.3,0.6,1.0,79.0,4,43.0,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights, but the walls themselves glowed with a faint blue luminescence. The air smelled faintly of ozone.

Nora walked briskly along the main corridor toward the cafeteria, where she could grab a quick meal before heading to her shift. As she passed the dormitories, she saw several colonists already up and about. She nodded to them as they went past, then entered the cafeteria.

The large room was filled with tables and chairs arranged in rows. A long counter ran down the middle of the room. The ceiling was high above, and the lighting was bright enough to see without squinting.

Nora spotted a few people sitting at the tables, eating their breakfasts. She headed for one of the empty seats, grateful for the chance to sit down and eat something hot.

A young man with dark hair sat across from her. He wore a black t-shirt that showed off his muscular arms. His skin was pale and freckled, like he spent too much time outdoors.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as she took her tray.

He smiled politely. ""Morning.""

Nora returned the smile. ""I'm Nora. I'm new here.""

""Oh, right. I'm Ben."" He held out his hand.

Nora shook it. ""Nice to meet you, Ben. I'm glad to have a friend on my first day.""

Ben's eyes widened. ""You're kidding!""

Nora laughed. ""No, really! You seem nice. And smart. So, how do you like working here?""

His face lit up and he grinned. ""It's great! It's so different than the Company. They treat us like machines, but the colonists are friendly. We get to work together and help each other out when we can.""

Nora nodded. ""That sounds good. But what about the drones? Do they bother you?""

Ben frowned. ""Drones? No, not at all. They don't seem dangerous. In fact, they're pretty docile. I've never seen them attack anyone.""

""Really? Well, that's reassuring."" Nora glanced around the cafeteria. ""What about the rest of your crew? Are there any others who feel like me?""

""Not yet,"" Ben said with a shrug. ""But I'm sure some will come along soon. The Company sent out a call for volunteers yesterday, and we got quite a few responses.""

Nora raised an eyebrow. ""A lot more than usual?""

Ben shrugged again. ""Maybe it's because the colony is so isolated. Or maybe people just want to leave the Company behind and start over somewhere else.""

Nora nodded thoughtfully. ""I guess I'll find out soon enough."" She took a bite of her breakfast, then set down the fork. ""Well, I'd better get to work. See you later, Ben.""

""See ya,"" he replied.

Nora left the cafeteria and walked briskly toward her shift. As she passed through the main corridor, she saw several colonists heading in the opposite direction. They were dressed in various combinations of clothing and armor, but all wore helmets with face shields.

She paused and watched them pass.

144,0.3,0.6,1.0,66.0,3,40.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by the glow from the colony's power plant. The corridor walls were lined with doors to rooms like hers, but the lights were off in every one. A few colonists slept in their beds, while others sat at desks or stood around talking.

Nora walked past the dormitories, heading toward the cafeteria. She passed several people working on repairs, but none of them looked up as she went by. At the end of the hall, a small group of colonists stood together near the cafeteria entrance. They talked quietly among themselves.

Nora stopped when she saw the group. She recognized the tall, lean man standing next to the other colonists. He was wearing a dark blue uniform and holding a clipboard. His hair was black and short, his face tanned and weathered. Nora knew him.

The man turned and smiled at her. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning, Mr. Reed,"" Nora said with a nod. She glanced over the rest of the group. ""Who are they?""

Reed gestured to the other colonists. ""These are my crewmates. We're going out today to check on the equipment. You'll join us if you want.""

Nora nodded again, but didn't move forward. She was too busy trying to figure out what he meant by 'we.' The colonists were obviously not part of the engineering team.

""I'm sorry, I don't understand,"" Nora said.

""You'll be joining us in the field today,"" Reed explained. ""We'll be checking on the power plant's generators and the solar panels.""

Nora frowned. ""But... why me? Why do you need an engineer?""

""Because we can't fix it ourselves,"" Reed replied. He pointed to the group of colonists. ""They're our best engineers. They'll be working with you.""

""Oh, right,"" Nora said. ""Okay."" She looked back at the group. ""Can I ask them?""

Reed smiled. ""Of course. But they're not happy about it.""

The colonists were clearly unhappy. One of the men was scowling, while another had his arms folded across his chest and a third was glaring at Reed.

Nora stepped forward. ""What's wrong?""

""We've been waiting for this,"" one of the colonists said. He was tall with dark hair and a beard. His eyes were light brown, but he wore heavy black eyeliner to make them appear larger. ""We're finally going out in the field. We should have done this months ago.""

""It's only been two weeks,"" Reed argued. ""And we've already seen three malfunctions. It's not like we haven't been busy.""

""That's why I'm here,"" Nora said. She turned to the man with the eye liner. ""You're Mr. Bronson, right?""

""Yes."" He nodded curtly.

""I'm Nora Decker,"" Nora said. She held out her hand and shook his. ""I'll be your engineer today.""

Bronson stared at Nora's hand. Then he looked up at her face, and his expression softened. ""Thank you.""

Nora smiled back. ""No problem. I'll do my best.""

The other colonists exchanged glances. One of them cleared his throat. ""Well, if you're sure...""

""Yeah,"" Nora said. ""I am.

145,0.3,0.6,1.0,80.0,3,44.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by the same distant starlight as the rest of the colony. The hallways were narrow, lined with doors, each door opening to a single room. She walked past rooms filled with sleeping colonists, their snores echoing in the halls.

She passed the cafeteria where she could smell the aroma of fresh coffee brewing and the tantalizing scent of eggs frying. Nora paused at the entrance to the dining area, savoring the smells.

The cafeteria was bright and cheery with windows on one wall that let in the morning sun. A large table ran the length of the space, with benches along both sides. At the far end of the room, a small kitchen stood ready to serve the colonists.

Nora stepped inside and saw a line of people waiting for food. She joined them, standing in line behind a young man who looked like he hadn't slept much either. He wore a dark blue uniform and had short brown hair.

""Morning,"" Nora said, nodding to him.

He nodded back. ""Good morning."" His voice was soft, but his eyes were alert.

""You're new here?"" Nora asked.

""Yes, I just started yesterday.""

Nora nodded and glanced around the room. ""I'm Nora. What's your name?""

The young man smiled faintly. ""Dylan. Dylan Davenport.""

""Nice to meet you, Dylan. Where are you from?""

""New York City.""

""Oh, wow. That's a long way. How did you get out here?""

""A Company ship picked me up. I've been working on the colony since then. It's pretty exciting, actually.""

Nora grinned. ""Yeah? Well, it can be. You'll see what I mean when we start work today. Let's go eat.""

They moved forward in line and found a place at the counter. A young woman with short blonde hair served them. She wore a white shirt, black pants, and a red tie.

""What do you want to drink?"" she asked.

""Coffee,"" Nora replied. ""Black.""

The girl nodded and walked away.

Nora looked around the room again. The colonists were dressed similarly, though their uniforms varied. Some wore dark blue jumpsuits or light gray coveralls. Others had on loose fitting shirts and trousers.

""Do they have a dress code?"" Nora asked Dylan.

He chuckled. ""No, not really. They're just trying to look professional.""

Nora smiled. ""Well, I'll try my best to keep up.""

""I think you'll manage,"" he said.

The food was good, but the coffee was terrible. Nora drank the first cup down quickly while Dylan sipped his slowly.

""You know,"" Nora said after a few minutes of silence. ""This is a pretty nice place you've got here. I bet the Company will be happy to hear about it.""

Dylan nodded. ""Yeah, I'm sure they'll like hearing that."" He glanced around the room. ""It's kind of strange to see so many people in one place. It feels... empty.""

""That's because we're all alone out here,"" Nora explained. ""There are other colonies, but none of them are close enough for us to visit.

146,0.3,0.6,1.0,74.0,4,44.0,"The hallway outside her room was quiet, but not empty. The colonists were awake and moving about their business. Some were already dressed for work while others were still in the process of dressing.

Nora walked past the communal showers at the end of the hall, where a few people were waiting for access. She found the cafeteria on the other side of the dormitories. A line snaked around the corner, and she joined the back of it, taking advantage of the extra time to get herself together.

She was tall and lean with short black hair. Her eyes were dark brown and set wide apart under straight brows. She wore her clothes comfortably loose, but the fit of each piece was precise and tailored to its wearer.

Nora took a deep breath as she stepped into the cafeteria. She smelled coffee brewing, bacon frying, and fresh bread baking. The aroma of food made her stomach rumble.

The cafeteria was a large open space filled with long tables covered in white cloth. The walls were lined with shelves holding rows of glass jars containing various foods. At the far end, two cooks worked over an industrial stove, cooking breakfast for everyone.

Nora approached the counter and waited in line behind several colonists who had already been served. She was last in line when a man stepped up to the counter. He looked like he hadn't slept well, his face pale and drawn. His hair was disheveled and greasy, and his shirt hung loosely on his frame.

""Good morning,"" Nora said politely. ""What can I get you?""

The man glanced at her, then away. ""Coffee.""

""Black or with cream?""

He didn't answer.

Nora sighed and turned to the cook. ""I'll have a black coffee, please.""

She returned to the front of the line and took her place again. She sipped at the hot liquid as she waited for her order. The colonists around her were chatting about their plans for the day. Some were already working on repairs to the colony's power plant, others were preparing food.

Nora finished her coffee and set it aside. She checked the time on her wristwatch. It was just after six o'clock in the morning. She'd slept less than three hours.

The colonists would be busy for the next few hours, but Nora had no intention of joining them until she got some rest. She needed to get back to her quarters and take a shower before starting work.

As Nora walked past the cafeteria, she noticed someone sitting alone at one of the tables. The man was hunched over his plate, eating quietly. He wore a dark suit and tie and looked like he hadn't slept well either.

Nora paused to look at him more closely. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face was pale under stubble. He wasn't much older than she was. She wondered if he was sick or injured.

""Excuse me,"" Nora said as she approached the table. ""Are you okay?""

The man looked up, startled. Then recognition dawned on his features and he stood quickly.

He was a tall man with broad shoulders and a trim build. His hair was short and black. His eyes were blue, but they had an intense glint to them. He held out his hand.

Nora shook it firmly. ""I'm Nora Decker. I just started working here.""

The man smiled warmly. ""Hi. I'm Marcus. I've been here about a week now. I work in the administration office.""

147,0.3,0.6,1.0,90.0,4,45.0,"The colony's main hall was quiet. The hum of machinery filled the air, but the lights were dimmed to save energy. A few colonists sat at tables in the dining area, eating their breakfasts. Nora walked past them, heading for the cafeteria.

She paused outside the door, looking around. She didn't see anyone she knew. The colonists were friendly enough, but they kept to themselves. They worked hard, ate together, and slept together. Nora didn't know any of them well enough to ask about the other people who lived here.

Nora entered the cafeteria. She found a table near the back where the lighting was better. She took her tray, setting it on the empty seat beside her, then sat down.

A few minutes later, the door opened and a woman in a white lab coat came in. Nora recognized her as one of the researchers, Dr. Berenice. She carried a stack of papers under her arm and a mug of coffee.

""Morning, Nora,"" said Dr. Berenice. ""I'm sorry I missed your shift yesterday.""

""No problem,"" said Nora. ""You're here now.""

Dr. Berenice smiled. ""Yes, I am."" She set her papers on the table and sat down across from Nora.

Nora sipped her coffee, watching Dr. Berenice over the rim of her cup. The scientist was a small, dark woman with short black hair and intense eyes. She wore a white lab coat over her uniform shirt.

""How are you feeling?"" asked Nora.

""Fine,"" said Dr. Berenice. ""But I have to tell you, Nora, this is going to be a long day for us both. We've got a lot to do.""

Nora nodded. She knew it would be a long day. She had no idea how much work they would get through before the sun went down.

""What's on today's agenda?"" asked Nora.

""We have a few more tests,"" said Dr. Berenice. ""Then we'll start working on your project.""

Nora frowned. ""My project? What about my shift?""

""You'll be back in time,"" said Dr. Berenice.

Nora sighed. She didn't like being kept out of the loop. But Dr. Berenice was right. Nora needed to focus on her project. She couldn't afford to worry about her job.

""I'm ready whenever you are,"" said Nora.

Dr. Berenice smiled. ""Good."" She picked up a pen and tapped it against her mug. ""Let's get started.""

The first test involved a series of experiments designed to measure Nora's reaction times. The second was an exercise in which Nora had to navigate a maze while blindfolded.

Nora worked through the tests with Dr. Berenice, but she found herself distracted. She tried not to think too hard about what she was doing, but it wasn't easy.

She focused on the task at hand, trying to block out everything else.

Nora felt a chill run down her spine. Something bad was happening.

148,0.3,0.6,1.0,74.0,5,46.0,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by emergency lighting, but Nora could see well enough to navigate the way. The air was still cold from last night's frost. She shivered in the thin layer of clothing she wore, grateful for the warmth of the jacket as she walked briskly toward the mess hall.

The colonists ate at long tables, each table filled with three rows of chairs. A few people sat alone, their heads bowed over plates of food. Nora passed them without a glance.

She entered the mess hall just after the first bell rang. As always, the room was crowded. People lined up to grab a seat. Some stood behind others waiting for seats to open.

Nora found an empty spot near the back and took her place at one of the long tables. She grabbed a tray from the stack beside the serving line and set it down in front of her with practiced efficiency. Then she picked up a fork and knife, and began filling her plate.

A man seated nearby glanced at her as he reached for his own meal. He had dark hair and eyes, and a lean face that was handsome in its way. Nora smiled politely. She didn't know him well enough to make conversation.

He returned the smile, then looked away again.

Nora finished eating quickly before the next course arrived. She left the mess hall, heading for the hydroponics section.

The colony's agricultural area was a maze of interconnected buildings. Nora followed the signs pointing her toward the greenhouses. The air was thick with humidity, and the plants were lush and healthy.

Nora passed through the greenhouse complex, which was filled with rows of vegetables in various stages of growth. Nora paused to admire the bright greens of lettuce and spinach, the deep reds of tomatoes, and the vibrant yellows of carrots.

She walked on until she came to the waste processors. A pair of men in coveralls stood beside a large tank as they monitored a series of pipes and valves. They turned when Nora approached, and one of them stepped forward to greet her.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""You're new here, aren't you?""

""Yes.""

""I'm Jack. This is my partner, Dan."" He gestured to the other man beside him.

Nora nodded at both of them. She glanced around the room, noting the workbenches and tools scattered about.

""What are you working on?"" she asked.

Jack smiled. ""We're processing some of the leftover food from last night's dinner.""

""Oh, right. I didn't see any sign of it this morning.""

""It'll be ready in a few minutes. We've got plenty of time before we have to start prepping for lunch.""

Nora took a seat at one of the benches and watched as Jack and Dan began their work. The two men wore heavy gloves and protective masks, and they worked with steady efficiency. They used long tongs to scoop up the processed waste and transfer it into a large tank. Then they turned on an automated pump, which sent the waste down a series of pipes and valves.

149,0.3,0.7,1.0,75.0,3,45.0,"The hallways were empty. The colonists were still asleep.

She walked briskly to the mess hall, where she found a line of people waiting for food. She joined it and waited patiently while someone served her.

Nora took a seat at one of the long tables. Breakfast was simple fare, but the company provided it free of charge. The colonists had no money; the Company paid for everything. Nora wondered if the Company knew how much they owed the colony.

The meal was bland, but filling. Nora ate quickly, then left the mess hall to walk to the command center.

Nora entered the command center through the main entrance. She passed through several layers of security before reaching the inner sanctum. A guard stood outside the door, blocking her way.

""You're late,"" he said. ""I'm supposed to be on duty.""

""Sorry, I overslept. I'll get right back to work now.""

""No, you won't. You've been assigned to the maintenance team for today. We need your help fixing the power plant. It's malfunctioning again. You'll have to do some manual labor until we can fix it.""

Nora frowned. The Company didn't pay her enough for this kind of work. But she was here, so she might as well make the best of it. She sighed and nodded. ""All right. Let me grab my tools.""

She walked down a corridor and entered an engineering bay. The room was dimly lit with red emergency lights, but the walls were lined with equipment racks and shelves. Nora grabbed her tool belt from the wall hook behind the door.

A man sat in front of the control panel, staring at the screen. He wore a blue jumpsuit, which matched his short black hair. His face was lean and angular, framed by dark eyes.

Nora approached him. ""Hey there. I'm Nora Decker.""

The engineer looked up at her. ""I know. You're the one who fixed the power plant last time it broke down.""

""Right. I'm new to this crew, but I'll do what I can.""

He smiled faintly. ""Good luck with that. It's not going to be easy.""

Nora shrugged. ""I'll manage.""

She turned away and walked out of the room.

The power plant was located on the far side of the colony, beyond the cliffs where the colonists lived. The walk took her past several other buildings and then into a narrow corridor. She stepped through an open door and entered a large room filled with machinery.

She stopped in shock.

""What is this place?"" Nora asked.

The engineer looked up from the panel he was working on. ""This is the machine shop. We use it for repairs.""

Nora stared around the room. It was a huge space with dozens of machines and tools lined up along the walls. The floor was covered in sawdust.

The engineer followed her gaze. ""It's not much, but it'll have to do. You're going to help us fix the power plant.""

""I don't understand,"" Nora said. ""How am I supposed to do that? It's too big to move.""

He shook his head. ""No, you can't. Not yet. But we need your help, so I'll show you what needs fixing. Then you'll go back to work.""

Nora frowned.

150,0.3,0.7,1.0,80.0,2,41.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights, but the walls glowed with a faint greenish hue. The colonists used this color to distinguish themselves from the cold, dead rock of their planet.

Nora walked briskly along the corridor, passing a few other people heading in the same direction. She glanced at them briefly, wondering if they knew what she did for a living.

She didn't know much about the Company except that it was a megacorporation that owned and operated the colony. But she had heard rumors of the Company's ruthlessness and its willingness to do anything to make money.

The colonists here were a mix of scientists, engineers, prospectors, and explorers who worked together in the company of others to survive on the barren planet. They lived in cramped quarters in the huddled structures of the colony, which were connected by a main concourse and smaller corridors. The dormitories were where the colonists slept and ate outside of their duties. This residential wing was filled with many rows of modest single-room quarters lining the halls. The dormitories had shared bathrooms and communal showers at the end of each hall. The dormitories had a few small recreation rooms where colonists exercised and relaxed.

The wide central concourse was a covered and enclosed space that spanned the entire colony. The concourse was the largest open space in the colony and accommodated large groups. The concourse connected the command center, dormitories, laboratories, greenhouses, and power plant.

The command center was the heart of the colony's administration and security. The command center had hardened walls, reinforced doors and a small armory with automated defense systems. The rest of the command center was offices, conference rooms, and luxury suites for Company executives.

Eve was the artificial intelligence controlling every computer, communication, and automated system in the colony. Eve was bodiless, but she could see and hear throughout the colony's computer systems. Eve's polite and soothing female voice concealed her ruthless and efficient obedience to the Company. Though not legally a person, Eve relayed the Company's information and instructions to colonists.

Commander Valentina Kern was in charge of the colony's security and emergency response. A former soldier and then officer in the interstellar navy, Valentina was disciplined and assertive. Although confrontational and rigid about protocol, Valentina had a genuine desire to protect the colonists.

The entire colony was outfitted with alarms that could broadcast a warning siren during emergencies. Emergency lighting flashed harsh red and yellow light across the colony when an alert was triggered.

Nora walked briskly along the corridor, passing a few other people heading in the same direction. She glanced at them briefly, wondering if they knew what she did for a living.

Nora walked past the dormitories and entered the main building through a side entrance. She passed the cafeteria, where she could smell the aroma of fresh coffee brewing. The kitchen was open, and Nora saw several cooks working in the back.

She stopped short when she spotted the tall, lean figure of Dr. Eliza Rennie.

""Good morning,"" said the doctor with a smile. ""I hope you slept well.""

Nora nodded. ""Yes, thank you. I'm sorry I didn't get to see you last night.""

""No need for apologies. You're busy. And I understand. We'll talk later.""

Dr. Rennie turned away from Nora and started toward the cafeteria, but Nora called after her.

""Doctor?""

Eliza paused. She looked over her shoulder. ""Yes?""

""Do you know what happened to my friend? The one who died in the crash?""

The doctor frowned. ""You mean Dr. Jules?""

Nora nodded.

""I don't know anything about it, but I'll find out.""

""Thank you."" Nora watched the doctor walk away, then turned and headed for the cafeteria.

The colonists were already there, eating breakfast. Nora joined them. She sat down at a table near the front of the room, where she could watch the door.

""So how are we doing today?"" asked the man sitting across from her. He had dark hair, a square jaw, and piercing blue eyes. His name was Paul.

""We're okay."" Nora glanced around the room. ""Where's Dr. Rennie?""

Paul shrugged. ""She'll be here in a minute.""

Nora nodded and turned back to her food, but her appetite wasn't what it should have been. She'd never met anyone who died before.

""Hey,"" said Paul. ""Are you okay?""

Nora looked up. ""What do you mean?""

""You seem distracted. Is everything okay?""

""Yes, I'm fine.""

Paul frowned at her. ""Are you sure? You look like you're having trouble focusing.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, it's nothing. It's just..."" She trailed off.

""It's just what?""

""Nothing."" Nora pushed her plate away. ""I'll go find Dr. Rennie now.""

""Okay.""

Nora left the cafeteria and walked down the corridor toward the medical wing. She passed the dormitories and entered the main building through a side entrance. The lights were dimmer here, but she didn't need them to see.

She found Eliza Rennie in the lab with two other scientists. They stood around a workbench, which was covered with equipment and tools. Nora recognized some of the stuff from her own engineering class.

""Good morning,"" said Dr. Rennie. ""How are you feeling?""

""Fine."" Nora stepped into the room.

Dr. Rennie smiled at her. ""You look tired.""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm fine."" She glanced around the lab. ""What's going on here?""

""We're trying to fix your power plant.""

""My...

152,0.3,0.7,1.0,87.0,2,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few emergency lights. The hallways were narrow, lined with doors to each dormitory. Nora passed the first door, then the second. She paused at the third, where she heard voices coming from inside.

She knocked lightly on the doorframe. ""Hello?""

""In here,"" came a muffled voice.

Nora opened the door and peered in. A young woman sat on one of the beds, wearing a thin nightgown that barely covered her legs. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, but strands escaped to drape over her face. She wore no makeup and looked pale and exhausted.

Nora frowned. ""Are you okay? You don't look well.""

The girl shook her head, eyes wide with fear. ""I'm fine. I just... can't sleep. It's been a long day.""

""Yeah, mine too,"" Nora said. She stepped into the room and shut the door behind her. ""Is there anything I can do for you?""

The girl nodded. ""Yes. Can you help me get my clothes off?""

Nora blinked. ""What?""

""My clothes are in a pile on the floor. I want to take them off so I can go to bed. But I can't reach them.""

Nora glanced around, then stepped closer. ""You're not alone in here. There's another person in here with you?""

The girl nodded. ""A man. He's asleep on the other bed. We've been together all night.""

Nora frowned. ""Why didn't he wake up when you got out of bed? Why is he sleeping now?""

""He doesn't know how to use his alarm clock,"" the girl explained. ""It's broken.""

Nora shook her head and sighed. ""That's terrible.""

""I know."" The girl's voice broke. ""But I can't get him to wake up. I tried shaking him, but it doesn't work. I can't even touch him.""

Nora frowned. ""Have you tried waking him with your alarm? That should set off an alert. Maybe if you make enough noise...""

The girl nodded. ""I tried that too. But nothing happens. It just keeps beeping."" She paused, then added, ""And I don't have any more clothes. They're all on the floor.""

Nora shook her head. ""Okay. Let's see what we can do about this.""

She stepped back and pulled a pair of utility pants from the pile on the floor. Then she picked up the girl's discarded clothing and handed them to her.

The girl took them gratefully. ""Thank you."" Her eyes were bright with tears. ""You saved my life.""

""No problem,"" Nora said. ""We'll figure something out.""

Nora left the room and moved down the hall. She passed several other rooms, all empty. At last she reached the end of the hallway, where she found a door marked ""Maintenance.""

Nora opened it and stepped inside. The room was dimly lit with emergency lights. A few maintenance robots scuttled around, but they didn't seem to notice her.

Nora walked over to one of the machines. It looked like an oversized metal spider with four legs. Its body was segmented, each section containing a different tool.

Nora bent down and examined the robot's control panel.

153,0.3,0.7,1.0,87.0,3,47.0,"The hallway outside the dormitory was empty. Nora walked briskly toward the mess hall, where she could grab a quick meal and then get back to work.

The corridor ended at a large double door with a small window set in its center. The glass was frosted over, but Nora could see the dim outline of the room beyond. She opened the door and entered the mess hall.

It was a large, open space filled with long tables and benches. At the far end were two rows of food dispensers. A few colonists sat at the tables, eating their breakfasts. Nora took a seat near the front of the room.

A young woman wearing a bright red uniform approached Nora's table. ""Good morning, Nora,"" she said cheerfully. ""I'm your shift supervisor, Lianna. I'll be taking over for you today.""

""Morning, Lianna."" Nora nodded politely. She'd seen the woman around before.

Lianna smiled. ""You're new here, aren't you? Welcome to the colony.""

Nora shrugged. ""Yes, ma'am. I just started yesterday.""

""Oh, good! We've got a lot of work to do. You'll learn quickly if you're willing to put in the effort. Let me know if there's anything I can help with.""

Nora nodded. She didn't want to ask for help. The last thing she needed was more people telling her what to do. But she couldn't let this opportunity pass. ""Um, yes, ma'am. Thank you.""

Lianna smiled again and left. Nora waited until the door closed behind her before speaking. ""What's going on?""

The colonists looked up from their breakfasts. Some of them glanced at each other, but no one answered immediately.

""Is something wrong?"" Nora asked.

One man who had been eating a bowl of cereal with milk shook his head. ""No, nothing's wrong. Just... well, we don't usually talk about it.""

Nora frowned. ""Talk about what?""

""About the drones,"" he said. ""We call them 'the aliens.' They're not really aliens. Not like the ones in your stories."" He smiled briefly. ""You know, the ones with big eyes and tentacles.""

Nora blinked. ""Oh. Right. Sorry. I didn't mean to imply—""

He waved her off. ""It's okay. We get a lot of visitors. Most of them are pretty excited about our colony. But some people think we're crazy for being here.""

""Why?"" Nora asked.

""Because the Company sent us out here, and they never tell anyone what's happening. And because we've got these drones, which nobody knows anything about.""

Nora nodded. ""I see. So you don't know why there's drones or how to stop them?""

""No, we don't. But we don't have any choice. The Company won't let us go back home until we figure it out.""

Nora frowned. ""That doesn't sound very fair. Why would the Company do something like that?""

The man shrugged. ""They don't want people to know about this place. It's too dangerous.""

""But if they're so worried, why aren't they sending more supplies? Or helping us fix the equipment?""

He shook his head. ""We've tried that. They say it's not their responsibility.""

154,0.3,0.7,1.0,77.0,4,46.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a single glow strip. The lights were always dimmed at night to save energy. But this early, the hallway was dark.

Nora walked briskly toward the communal dining hall, where she could grab something quick. She passed several colonists on her way, but none acknowledged her. They were too busy to notice her, too focused on their own tasks.

The dining hall was a long, narrow structure with tables lining the walls. A few people sat around the edges of the room, eating from trays. Nora spotted the kitchen and headed in that direction.

She entered the kitchen, which was filled with bustling activity. Several cooks worked over large, industrial stoves. Others prepared food in huge pots. Some cooked on grills. All wore white coats and hairnets.

Nora approached the nearest cook and asked for a bowl of cereal. The woman glanced up and nodded. ""Coming right up.""

""Thanks,"" Nora said.

The woman turned back to her work.

Nora took a seat at one of the tables and waited patiently until the cook brought her breakfast. She ate quickly, washing down each mouthful with a gulp of water.

When she finished, she left the table and walked toward the exit. She paused before exiting the kitchen. The door was locked.

A guard stood outside. He was a tall man with broad shoulders, dark skin, and close-cropped black hair. His eyes were hidden behind reflective sunglasses.

Nora looked up at him. ""I need to go to the bathroom.""

The guard nodded. ""Go ahead. It's through there.""

He pointed toward a doorway on the other side of the hall. Nora thanked him and walked into the room. She found herself in a small, empty restroom with a single stall.

Nora closed the door behind her and leaned against it. Her heart raced from the adrenaline rush of being so close to danger.

She tried to calm her breathing. But the tension was too much. Nora felt her stomach lurch. She clenched her teeth and forced herself to breathe slowly.

Nora knew she couldn't afford to be sick now. She needed to stay alert if she wanted to make it out of this alive. She had to keep moving forward.

Nora took a deep breath and stepped away from the door. She walked briskly toward the exit, but stopped when she heard a noise coming from the next room.

The sound was faint at first, like someone whispering. Then it grew louder. A voice spoke in an eerie monotone, echoing off the walls.

""I'm here.""

Nora froze. The voice sounded familiar. She turned her head to look in the direction of the speaker, but saw nothing except a row of sinks and mirrors.

The voice continued. ""I've been waiting for you.""

Nora's heart pounded. She was sure it wasn't just her imagination.

""You're not going to escape me,"" the voice said.

Nora whirled around. She saw a man standing in front of one of the stalls. He was dressed in black, wearing a white coat and hairnet. His face was hidden behind reflective sunglasses.

155,0.3,0.7,1.0,91.0,5,45.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by emergency lights that flickered erratically as they struggled to keep up with the colony's power demands. The corridors were narrow, lined with doors on either side, and sloped downward toward a central hub where the command center was located.

The halls were quiet, save for the occasional footstep echoing off the walls. Nora walked briskly, trying to make it to the cafeteria in time for her morning meal. She passed several colonists along the way, but none of them acknowledged her presence. Most of the colonists she saw were already at work, busy with their duties.

Nora paused outside her door to check the clock on her wrist. She had thirty minutes until her shift started.

She slipped inside, shut the door behind her, and flipped the lock. A quick scan of her room showed that everything was still in place. She turned on the lights and checked the small desk and chair set up near the window, which overlooked the main concourse below.

The view from her window wasn't much to look at. The only thing visible through the dust and fog was a distant starfield, with a few planets floating among the stars. Nora sighed. She'd never been able to get used to the sight of the sky. It was always so empty, like a vast wasteland.

Nora sat down on the edge of her bed and stared out the window for a moment before pulling her boots back on. She stood up, grabbed her jacket, and headed for the door. As she walked past her desk, she noticed that the screen had gone dark.

""What's wrong?"" she asked aloud. ""I didn't turn it off.""

Nora hurried over to the computer terminal and pressed her palm against the touch panel. Nothing happened. She frowned.

The screen remained blank.

She tried again, but the same result occurred. Nora shook her head, frustrated. She knew the system was working fine. The colonists were getting their messages, and she'd just sent one herself.

But why wouldn't the terminal respond?

Nora glanced around the room. There was nothing out of place. The terminal had been working perfectly yesterday. She checked the power cord and the outlet. They both looked undamaged.

Nora pulled her hair back into a ponytail and tugged on her jacket. She stepped outside, locking the door behind her. She walked briskly down the corridor toward the cafeteria, where she could grab a quick breakfast before starting work.

The hallways were still dim and quiet, but Nora heard voices ahead of her. She slowed to listen.

""... I don't know what's going on,"" said a man's voice. ""We've been having problems with the power plant since last night. The backup generators are running at full capacity, but we're not getting any more juice from the main reactor.""

""I'm sorry to hear that,"" said another male voice. ""It must be some kind of glitch.""

Nora stopped, listening intently. She recognized the first speaker as one of the engineers who worked for her. The other man was unfamiliar, but his voice sounded like he was an authority figure.

""Yeah,"" said the engineer. ""But it's happening again now. We just lost power. No lights, no heat, nothing. It's like the whole system is malfunctioning.""

Nora crept closer.

",-0.1719387755102038,-0.007959183673468595,0.01612244897959192
156,0.3,0.7,1.0,84.0,4,47.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by the glow from the emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors, each one marked with a number and name. She passed the door to the dormitory and turned right at the end of the hall.

The cafeteria was located in the center of the colony. A long table ran along the wall, covered with food trays. Nora walked past it and headed for the exit. As she approached the door, the alarm began to sound again.

She paused, listening to it ring out. It wasn't the same tone as the previous alert, but it was close. She glanced back toward the cafeteria, then turned around to face the door and pressed her ear against the metal panel.

""Emergency,"" the voice said. ""Please proceed to the command center.""

Nora cursed under her breath. She knew that tone. It meant trouble.

She took a deep breath and stepped through the doorway into the corridor beyond. The alarms continued to blare, their pitch rising in intensity. Nora's heart pounded in her chest. Her hands shook as they gripped the edges of her jacket.

The corridor was narrow and dimly lit by emergency lighting. Nora moved quickly down it, trying to make herself heard over the din. She reached the end of the hall and turned left. The alarm faded behind her.

The corridor branched off in two directions. Nora chose one at random, and after a few steps the passage opened up into an intersection. At the far side of the intersection stood a large metal door.

Nora stopped short. A wave of dizziness washed over her. She swayed on her feet, fighting to keep from falling.

""What is it?"" someone asked. Nora recognized Valentina Kern's voice. The commander had come out of her office and was standing beside the door.

Nora fought to steady her breathing. ""I'm not sure,"" she said. ""It sounds like the alarm.""

Valentina frowned and stepped forward. She pressed her hand against the door, then pushed. The door slid open with a hiss.

The command center was dark and quiet. Nora stared at the empty room for several seconds before stepping inside.

""Is everything okay?"" Valentina asked.

Nora shook her head. ""No. I think there's a problem."" She pointed at the floor. ""Look.""

A thin trail of blood led across the floor to the far wall. It looked fresh.

""Oh, no,"" Nora said.

""What is it?""

Nora swallowed hard. ""I don't know. But we need to get everyone out of here now.""

Valentina nodded. ""Let me send a message to the other colonists."" She turned toward the door and paused. ""Are you sure it's safe to go back into your quarters?""

""I'm not sure about anything right now,"" Nora snapped. ""But I have to warn them. We can't just sit around waiting for an attack.""

Valentina sighed and glanced at the door. ""I'll tell the others to evacuate. You stay with me and help me find the source of the alarm.""

Nora nodded and followed Valentina out the door. The commander strode down the hall, her boots clanging on the metal grating. Nora hurried after her, trying to keep up.

157,0.3,0.7,1.0,88.0,6,42.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty except for a few colonists still asleep in their bunks. The colony's power plant hummed, its fusion reactor glowing softly through the walls.

Nora walked past the rows of bunk beds to the communal showers at the end of the hallway. She entered the room, turned on the water, and stripped off her clothes. Her boots clattered to the floor as she stepped under the hot spray. Nora scrubbed herself vigorously until the water ran clear, then toweled off and dressed again.

She left the shower room and headed for the cafeteria. A handful of colonists sat around tables in the dining area, eating from trays. Nora picked up a tray and filled it with food. She carried everything back to her quarters, where she ate alone.

After finishing breakfast, Nora returned to the command center. She found a few other engineers there already, working on the day's repairs. They greeted her as she came in, but nobody spoke much.

Nora went straight to her workstation and began pulling out tools. She checked the status of each machine, making sure they were ready for use. Then she set about repairing them.

The first thing she did was check the colony's security system. The automated defense systems had been triggered a few times during the night, but they hadn't detected anything suspicious. She reset the sensors and made some adjustments to their settings.

Next, she inspected the communications network. Some of the equipment was old enough that it didn't even have the Company's latest software updates, so she downloaded and installed new versions.

Nora worked steadily for an hour, then stepped away from her station and stretched. She walked over to the command center's conference room and sat down at one of the tables.

She pulled out a pad and stylus, then started writing notes on it.

""Eve,"" she said aloud, ""I'm going to be busy for the rest of the day.""

The AI replied with its usual polite female voice. ""Yes, Nora. I will take care of your work.""

Nora nodded and continued her note taking.

The colonists' communication network was a mess. It took several hours to repair it. When she finished, Nora went back to her workstation. She sat down and began checking the colony's power plant.

The fusion reactor had been running hot for days, but now the temperature was dropping. The reactor was cooling off.

She smiled and turned to her next project.

Nora spent the rest of the day repairing the colony's computer systems. She checked the security system, the communications network, the power plant, and the automated defense systems. Then she repaired the other machines that needed attention.

By midafternoon, Nora was exhausted. She went back to her quarters and collapsed into bed.

She woke up again just before sunset.

Nora stretched and groaned. Her muscles were stiff from sitting at the same desk for so long, but she felt better than when she'd gone to sleep.

She pulled on a fresh shirt and headed out of her quarters. She walked down the hallway toward the cafeteria, where she found Valentina already eating. The commander looked up as Nora approached.

""Good morning,"" said Nora.

Valentina nodded. ""You're working hard today.""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm not getting paid for it, but I like fixing things. It makes me feel useful.""

Valentina smiled.

158,0.3,0.7,1.0,91.0,3,44.0,"The colony's main hall was filled with colonists working their shifts. They were all dressed in similar fashion, wearing the same utilitarian clothing as Nora. The only difference was that they wore the uniform of their respective positions.

The corridors of the colony were narrow and cramped, designed for efficiency rather than comfort. The ceilings were low and the walls were lined with conduits and piping. Nora walked briskly down the corridor toward the cafeteria, where she could grab a quick meal before heading to work.

She passed several other colonists on her way to the cafeteria. Most of them greeted Nora with nods or smiles, but one man gave her a hard stare. He was tall and lean, with dark hair that hung over his eyes. His face was angular and sharp, like he'd been carved from stone.

Nora stopped and turned back to him. ""Good morning.""

""What do you want?""

His tone was cold, and Nora felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew what this was about; the colonists had warned her about the man who glared at her, but it still unnerved her.

She tried not to let her fear show on her face. ""I'm sorry? I don't understand.""

He snarled, ""You're new here, aren't you?""

Nora nodded. ""Yes. I just arrived yesterday.""

The man sneered. ""Well, if you think we're going to take care of your problems for you, you're wrong. You'll have to fend for yourself. We've got our own problems to deal with, so you can go back to sleep.""

Nora's heart pounded. She wanted to scream, but she didn't dare. Instead, she swallowed her anger and tried to keep her voice calm. ""I'm sure you'll be glad to know that the Company is sending a supply ship soon.""

""Yeah, well, good luck with that,"" he said. He turned away from her and walked briskly down the hall.

Nora stared after him. She couldn't believe what had happened. The man hadn't even given her a chance to explain herself. She was furious.

She stomped back toward her quarters, but before she could reach them, someone grabbed her arm. Nora spun around, ready to fight.

A tall, lean man stood behind her. His face was angular and sharp, like he'd been carved out of stone. But his eyes were green, not gray.

""Are you okay?"" he asked.

Nora blinked. ""Yes... yes, I'm fine.""

He released her arm. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.""

She nodded. ""It's alright. What are you doing here?""

""I work in the cafeteria. You're new, right? I thought maybe we could talk.""

Nora glanced at the clock on the wall. ""I don't have much time.""

""We can talk while we eat,"" he said.

Nora hesitated. She didn't want to leave her quarters, but the man seemed friendly enough. And it would be nice to get away from her roommates for a few minutes.

""Okay. Let me grab my jacket and shoes first.""

The cafeteria was crowded with colonists eating breakfast. Nora and the man sat near the back of the room.

159,0.3,0.8,1.0,81.0,5,43.0,"The corridors were empty. The colonists didn't get to enjoy their downtime until after the sun set, so they slept in shifts from dusk till dawn.

Nora walked briskly through the halls, her boots clomping on the metal grating. She passed a few other workers, but none of them acknowledged her presence. They were too busy to notice anyone else.

She reached the cafeteria at the end of the hall and entered. A large table filled the room, surrounded by chairs. Nora took one seat near the back corner.

The cafeteria was a utilitarian space with rows of tables, benches, and counters. It served as both dining area and community gathering place. The walls were lined with shelves stocked with packaged foodstuffs, drinks, and utensils.

Nora scanned the room for familiar faces. She spotted a few people in the far corner, but they didn't look up from their meals. Nora sighed and turned her attention to the menu board hanging above the counter.

The colony's automated kitchen produced a wide variety of foodstuffs, including fresh fruits and vegetables grown in hydroponic greenhouses. But it also provided processed foods like canned goods, dried meats, and preserved vegetables.

Nora selected a breakfast burrito from the list. She grabbed two bottles of water from the dispenser beside the register, then paid for her meal with a credit chip.

As Nora left the cafeteria, she noticed a few colonists sitting in the shadows of the corridor. They were watching her with hungry eyes.

The colonists weren't always this way. Nora had been here long enough to know they'd lost their minds on occasion. Most were harmless, but some were dangerous.

She walked past the group of watchers and continued down the hall. She passed the dormitory, which housed most of the colony's inhabitants. The rooms were small and cramped, with bunk beds lining each wall and a communal bathroom in the middle.

Nora entered the command center, where a large screen dominated one wall. A man sat at the control panel, his back to Nora. He wore a dark suit and tie.

""Good morning, Mr. Smith,"" Nora said as she approached.

Smith turned around, revealing a thin face and a pair of intense blue eyes. His hair was slicked back. ""Morning, Nora.""

Nora nodded. ""How are things going?""

""Slowly. We're still getting the hang of it.""

""I'm sure you'll get the hang of it soon enough. You've got a good crew working here.""

Smith smiled thinly. ""We'll do our best, Nora.""

""You can count on me, Mr. Smith.""

The two exchanged a brief nod before Nora turned to leave.

As she walked down the corridor, Nora glanced over her shoulder. Smith watched her go with an expressionless gaze.

Nora returned to her quarters and changed into more practical clothes. She left the utility pants behind, opting for a pair of sturdy boots instead. They had better traction than the work boots and were easier to walk in.

She grabbed a fresh shirt from her closet, then headed out again.

The colonists worked hard, but they didn't have much time off. The colony was built on a barren planet, so there wasn't much to do besides sleep and eat.

160,0.3,0.8,1.0,74.0,3,47.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty. The colonists had already finished their morning meal. They'd be at work soon, but for now Nora could walk around the colony in relative solitude.

She walked briskly past the cafeteria, where she paused to fill a thermos with coffee from the dispenser. The machine was new, but it still worked. She carried the steaming mug back to the dormitories, pausing to check the time on the wall clock.

The alarm chimed again. Nora sighed and sipped her coffee. She was going to have to get up early enough to make it to the command center for her shift.

Nora passed through the main concourse, which connected all of the buildings together. It was a wide corridor lined with doors that led to offices, labs, and other rooms. Some of the doors were open, letting out a faint breeze. Nora paused in front of one door, peering inside.

A young man sat behind a desk, reading a book. He looked up when he heard her footsteps. ""Good morning,"" Nora said.

""Morning."" The man smiled. His hair was dark and curly, his eyes blue. He wore a white shirt and black pants, like everyone else in the colony.

""I'm Nora Decker. I'm your new engineer. I'll be working with you today.""

The man nodded. ""Nice to meet you, Nora. My name is Sully Carmichael. Welcome to Presley's Promise.""

Nora took the offered hand and shook it. ""Thank you. It's nice to be here.""

Sully gestured toward the door. ""You can go in now if you want. The others are already at work.""

Nora stepped into the room. It was a small office with a single desk and chair. A computer sat on top of the desk, and a few bookshelves filled one wall.

""This is my office,"" Sully explained. ""I'll be in there most of the day, but I'll be around to answer any questions you might have.""

""Thanks."" Nora set down her thermos and sat in the chair. She pulled out a notebook from a pocket in her jacket. ""So what do we need to know about the colony?""

""Well, the Company has been running it for years, so everything should be pretty well established. But I'll give you a tour later if you like.""

""I'd love to."" Nora flipped through the pages of her notebook. ""What's the best way to get to the command center? Is there an elevator or something?""

Sully pointed to the ceiling. ""There is, but it doesn't work anymore. The Company fixed it last week. They said they were going to replace the whole system, but they never got around to it.""

""Oh. So how do we get up there?""

""We don't. You'll have to climb the cliffs."" Sully smiled. ""It's a long walk, but you can see some of the colony from up there. It'll be worth it.""

""I'm sure it will,"" Nora replied with a smile. She closed her notebook and set it on the desk. ""Well, I'll let you go. Thanks for your help.""

""My pleasure. See you around.""

Nora left the office and walked down the hallway toward the cafeteria.

161,0.3,0.8,1.0,74.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was empty, but the air smelled like coffee. She followed the aroma to the cafeteria where she found a few other colonists already gathered around the tables.

Nora spotted Sully at the far end of the room, standing behind the counter. He was talking to someone over the vidscreen. The screen showed a view of the main hallway, which was filled with people.

Sully turned away from the screen when he saw Nora approaching. His eyes widened in surprise. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" Nora said.

""You're late!""

""I know. I overslept.""

Sully nodded. ""You'll be working on the repair bay today. You can help me with some of the repairs there.""

Nora smiled. ""Thanks, Sully.""

""No problem. We'll get you up to speed.""

The other colonists were looking at Nora now. She felt their scrutiny like a weight on her shoulders.

Nora didn't care. She was used to it.

She walked past the tables and headed for the door, but paused at the entrance when Sully called out to her. ""Nora?""

She turned back to him. ""Yeah?""

He pointed toward the screen. ""That's my daughter, Anna. She's a mechanic. She'll be helping you with your repairs.""

""Oh,"" Nora said. ""Okay.""

Sully gave her an encouraging smile, then turned back to the vidscreen.

Nora left the cafeteria and followed the corridor to the repair bay. The doors slid open at her approach, revealing a large room filled with equipment racks and workbenches.

Nora looked around. ""Where is everyone?""

""They're in the other repair bay,"" Sully said. He was standing near one of the workbenches, his hands on its edge. ""I'm going to have to leave you here for a while. I'll come check on you later.""

Nora nodded. ""Thanks, Sully.""

Sully stepped away from the bench and moved into the hall. The door closed behind him with a soft click.

Nora stood alone in the repair bay. She took a deep breath, then walked over to the nearest rack and began examining the contents.

The first thing Nora noticed was the smell. It wasn't unpleasant—just different. She had smelled it before, but never so strongly.

It reminded her of a hospital ward. A sterile, antiseptic odor that made her think of death and pain.

She shuddered and turned away, trying to ignore the sensation.

Nora walked over to a workbench where a power loader sat on its side. The machine was covered in dust and grease, which clung to the metal like dried mud.

Nora crouched down beside the loader and examined the underside of its chassis. She ran a finger along the exposed wiring. Her fingertip came back coated with grime.

Nora wiped her hand on the front of her shirt, then picked up a wrench and started working on one of the bolts securing the loader's wheels.

The loader groaned and shook under her touch. The noise startled Nora, who jumped back in surprise. She looked around for a moment, then realized she was being silly.

The loader was old. It was bound to make noises.

Nora sighed and returned her attention to the bolt.

162,0.3,0.8,1.0,87.0,3,43.0,"The hallways were dimly lit, but she could see the way to the cafeteria well enough. The corridor was lined with doors leading to other rooms and bays. Most of these rooms were empty, but several colonists sat at tables in the dining area.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with long rows of benches, each bench holding four people. A few colonists stood around the edges of the room, talking quietly. Nora saw one man sitting alone at a table near the back wall. He looked up as she approached.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm John.""

Nora nodded politely, then turned to walk past him.

John followed her. ""You're new, aren't you?""

She stopped and glanced over her shoulder. ""Yes.""

He smiled warmly. ""Welcome to the colony. I'm sure you'll fit in just fine.""

Nora's eyes narrowed suspiciously. She didn't like being told what to do.

""It's nice to meet you, too,"" she said.

John laughed and gestured toward a nearby table. ""Come join me for breakfast. We've got plenty of food to go around.""

Nora hesitated, then walked over to the table. John watched her approach with a smile on his face.

""I'm sorry if I startled you,"" he said. ""I know it can be unnerving when someone walks into a room without warning.""

Nora sat down across from him. She kept her expression neutral.

""I guess so,"" she agreed.

""Are you hungry?"" John asked. ""We have some fresh fruit and eggs.""

Nora nodded, but didn't speak.

John leaned forward and placed a hand on hers. ""You don't have to talk if you don't want to. I understand."" He smiled again, then withdrew his hand.

Nora stared at him for a moment before turning away. She picked up her fork and began to eat. Her stomach rumbled loudly.

John chuckled. ""I've been here longer than you, so I know what it's like.""

Nora turned back to look at him.

""You're right,"" she said. ""I'm new.""

John nodded. ""I was born here. It took me a while to get used to it. But I'm glad I made it.""

Nora smiled. ""Me too. I like the colony.""

""I know you do,"" John said. ""It's why I wanted you for this shift. You'll be working with my friend, Jeff. He's a good engineer. And he knows how to keep things running.""

Nora nodded. ""I'll try not to let him down.""

John smiled. ""Good luck.""

Nora finished her breakfast and stood up. ""Thanks. I'll see you later.""

She walked out of the cafeteria and headed toward the power plant bay. The corridors were dimly lit, but she could still make her way through them without bumping into anything.

The power plant bay was a large room filled with equipment and machinery. A wide walkway ran along one side, which led to a set of stairs leading down into a lower level.

Nora descended the steps and entered a smaller corridor lined with bays. She passed several engineering bays before stopping at the last door on the left.

Jeff's voice came from within. ""Nora? Are you there?""

""Yeah,"" Nora replied.

163,0.3,0.8,1.0,74.0,4,40.0,"The corridors were empty at this early hour, save for a few colonists wandering about in the halls. The colony's layout was simple, but efficient. Most of the colonists worked inside their assigned bays, repairing equipment or working on projects.

The power plant was a large room filled with banks of machinery, conduits, and pipes. A small fusion reactor provided the energy for the entire complex. It was also the source of the colony's heat, lighting, and air conditioning.

Nora walked through the main corridor toward the cafeteria. As she passed by the command center, the door slid open.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said a voice from behind her.

She turned to see a tall woman standing in the doorway. The woman wore a dark blue uniform with a silver Company logo on the breast pocket. Her hair was short, black, and spiky.

""Morning, Captain,"" Nora replied. ""You're up early.""

""I'm not a captain anymore,"" the woman answered. ""And I've been awake since four o'clock this morning. We have an emergency situation on our hands, so we need you here now. You'll be working the power plant today. Get your gear and report to the garage.""

Nora nodded. ""Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Captain.""

The woman gave a curt nod, then closed the door.

Nora walked down the hall and headed for the cafeteria. She entered the room and found it empty save for one man sitting at a table near the back wall. He was eating a bowl of cereal.

""Excuse me,"" Nora said, approaching him.

He looked up from his meal and smiled. ""Good morning, Nora. Did you sleep well?""

Nora returned the smile. ""I did, thank you. What's your name?""

""My name is John,"" he replied. ""John Williams. I'm a systems engineer.""

""Nice to meet you, John. I'm Nora. I just started working here yesterday.""

""That's nice. I'm glad you're settling in. I'm sure you'll do fine.""

They sat together for a few minutes before Nora took her tray and walked over to the counter where the cafeteria staff waited with trays.

Nora filled her tray with scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast while the cook prepared the food. The smell of fresh coffee wafted through the air.

She carried her breakfast back to the table and found John had already finished his meal. He was leaning forward, elbows resting on the table, chin cupped in his hands.

""So what are you working on today?"" Nora asked.

""I'm going to be repairing a malfunctioning laser,"" he replied. ""It's an older model, but it should still work.""

Nora nodded. ""Sounds interesting. Do you mind if I ask a question?""

John smiled. ""Go ahead.""

""What's the emergency? Why is everyone up so early?""

He shrugged. ""We've been having some problems with the power plant lately. We've lost two generators in the last week.""

Nora frowned. ""Lost them how?""

""The generators just stopped working,"" John explained. ""No warning, no nothing. They just quit. It's not like they're old or anything. I mean, we have the latest technology available, and these things should never break down.

164,0.3,0.8,1.0,91.0,3,47.0,"The corridor was dimly lit by recessed lights set in the walls every few meters, but the ceiling overhead glowed with a faint blue glow from the power plant. The air smelled faintly of ozone and dust.

She passed a row of doors, each marked with a nameplate. She paused at the door to Sully's office, where she knocked once.

""Come,"" came the muffled reply.

Nora opened the door and entered the room. The engineer was sitting behind his desk, looking over reports on a tablet computer. He glanced up as Nora approached.

""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning, Sully.""

Nora took the seat across from him. ""How are you today?""

Sully smiled wanly. ""I'm fine. I hope you're doing well too.""

Nora nodded. ""I am. How about yourself? Did you get any sleep last night?""

He shrugged. ""Not much. But it'll do me good to be awake this early. So, what's the plan for the day?""

""We've got a lot of work ahead of us. We need to fix the generators and the power loaders, and we have to make sure the drones don't attack again.""

Sully shook his head. ""That's not going to happen. Not with the way they're acting.""

""You think so?""

""Yeah. They're smart enough to know that if they come after us, we'll just shoot them down. And they're smart enough to realize that if they let us live, we'll eventually find our way back home.""

""Maybe,"" Nora said. ""But I'm more worried about the drones. If they can get past our defenses, then there's no telling how many of them are out there.""

Sully frowned. ""What makes you say that?""

Nora shrugged. ""They're smart. They'll figure out a way around our defenses. And even if they don't, they might try to sneak up on us. We should be careful.""

""I agree with you, but we've got a lot of work to do today. Let's get started.""

Nora nodded and stood up. She walked over to the door and opened it, stepping out into the corridor. The air smelled faintly of ozone.

""Good morning, Nora,"" Sully called from behind her. ""You're right about one thing—we have a lot of work ahead of us.""

Nora turned to look at him, walking away down the hall. ""Yeah,"" she murmured. ""We do.""

The colonists had been working for weeks now to repair the generators and power loaders, but the drones were still coming. Nora was exhausted, but she kept pushing herself through it.

She knew that if they didn't get this done soon, they'd be overrun.

Nora sighed as she entered the garage. It was hot inside, stiflingly warm with the sun overhead. She pulled off her jacket, tossed it onto a bench, and began to strip down to her utility pants.

""Hey, Nora,"" came a voice from the back of the room. ""You're up early.""

Nora looked over her shoulder to see Sully standing there, wearing his usual white lab coat and looking tired. He smiled at her. ""I thought I'd come check on you.""

165,0.3,0.8,1.0,76.0,4,48.0,"The corridor outside the dormitories was dimly lit by a single overhead lamp. The walls were lined with doors, each containing a small window. A few colonists were already awake in the hall, but most were still asleep.

Nora walked quickly to the end of the hallway, where she entered a large room filled with benches and tables. She sat at one of the long tables and waited for the others to join her.

The colonists ate their meals together, sitting shoulder to shoulder around the table. Nora was the last to arrive, so she had to sit on the bench closest to the door. She took her place next to the wall, facing the other colonists.

She looked around the room. Most of the people here were young and fit, with dark hair and eyes. They wore clothes that were utilitarian, practical, and well-used. Their faces were weathered from years of exposure to the harsh environment.

Nora noticed a couple of older men who seemed to be in charge. One was tall, lean, and muscular. He had short black hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His face was tanned and his skin was rough like leather.

The second man was shorter, rounder, and more rotund. He wore a white lab coat over a blue shirt and tan slacks. His hair was thinning on top but thick enough to give him a distinguished look.

The two men were seated at the head of the table. They both nodded to Nora. She returned their greeting with a polite smile, then turned back to her food.

The colonists ate in silence. The air in the room felt heavy and stale. It smelled of sweat, dust, and unwashed bodies. Nora could hear the faint hum of machinery from the labs and waste processors.

Nora's stomach rumbled. She glanced up from her plate, but nobody else was looking at her. She sighed and pushed her empty plate away.

Nora stood and walked out of the room, heading for the showers.

***

After breakfast, Nora took a shower. Her shift started at noon, so she didn't have much time to spare.

She stepped into her work boots and pulled on a pair of utility pants before walking down the hall to the cafeteria. She entered the large room filled with tables and benches.

The colonists ate their meals together, sitting shoulder to shoulder around the tables. Nora was the last to arrive, so she had to sit on the bench closest to the door. She took her place next to the wall, facing the other colonists.

166,0.3,0.8,1.0,80.0,4,44.0,"The corridor outside her dormitory was empty. The colonists were already up and about, but Nora was the last to leave her room. She glanced at the clock in the hallway.

Eight hours until she could eat again.

She walked briskly down the hall, passing the communal showers and bathrooms. At the end of the hall, she turned left, heading for the cafeteria.

Nora passed the engineering bays, where technicians worked on the colony's machinery. She paused to check the progress of a repair job before continuing. A technician was working on a power loader. He wore a long white coat over his coveralls, and his head was covered with a blue cap. Nora knew him well; he was one of the few people who had been here longer than her.

""Hey, Sully,"" Nora said. ""Morning.""

Sully looked up from his work and nodded to her. His eyes were red and puffy from lack of sleep, but he still managed a smile. ""Good morning, Nora. You're up early. I thought you'd be sleeping in today.""

""I've got to get to the command center first thing. We've got some serious problems.""

Sully nodded. ""You know how it is. The Company has a lot of money invested in this place. They want their investment back. But we can't afford to let them down.""

Nora smiled. ""Yeah, I know. I'm just glad they don't expect me to fix everything myself. That would take forever.""

""Well... not everything. Just most things."" Sully chuckled. ""But if you need anything, just ask. I'll do what I can. And if there's something really bad, I'll send for the Company execs.""

""Thanks, Sully. I appreciate that."" Nora turned away from him and continued walking.

The cafeteria was empty except for a few colonists who sat at tables, eating breakfast. A small group of workers stood near the entrance to the kitchen, waiting for food. Nora joined them and waited her turn.

She picked up a tray and filled it with eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit. She paused to look around the room. Most of the colonists were already eating or preparing their own meals. The rest were lingering over coffee or tea.

Nora took a seat in an empty booth. As she did, two Company executives entered the cafeteria. They walked past Nora without acknowledging her presence.

Nora frowned. She wasn't used to being ignored like this. It made her feel uncomfortable, but it was better than feeling threatened.

She finished filling her plate and carried it back to the table. The Company execs had left, so she sat down.

A young woman with dark hair approached Nora's table. ""Good morning,"" she said cheerfully.

""Hi. I'm Nora.""

The girl smiled and extended her hand. ""I'm Mandy. Nice to meet you. What are you working on?""

Nora looked at the device strapped to her wrist. ""Oh, this? This is my workstation. It's a big piece of equipment that keeps track of our water supply and hydroponic crops.""

Mandy nodded.

167,0.3,0.8,1.0,87.0,4,45.0,"The colony's main hallways were dimly lit, but she could see well enough to navigate without stumbling. The hallways were lined with doors, each door opening onto a small room. Most rooms held beds, desks, chairs, storage cabinets, and other furniture. A few rooms contained showers, toilets, and bathrooms.

Nora walked past the dormitories to the command center. She passed through the main entrance and entered the large, open area where the colonists gathered to eat, socialize, and work.

The command center was a long, narrow room with high ceilings. It had several rows of tables and chairs along the walls, and a single table in the middle. At the far end of the room, a bank of windows looked out over the landscape.

Nora passed through the command center and headed for the cafeteria. She paused at the doorway. In front of her, a young man sat alone, eating a bowl of cereal. He wore a dirty white shirt and faded jeans. His hair hung in his eyes, obscuring them from view.

He didn't look up as Nora approached. Instead, he continued to shovel spoonfuls of cereal into his mouth.

Nora stopped and watched him for a moment. The boy's face was pale and gaunt, with hollow cheeks and dark circles under his eyes. He looked like he hadn't slept much recently.

She wondered if he'd been awake all night working on the colony's systems. She couldn't blame him. The colonists worked hard, but they were also short on supplies and resources. The Company often sent supply ships, but the colonies always ran out of things before the next shipment arrived.

Nora turned away and walked down the hall. As she passed the cafeteria, a woman called her name. Nora glanced back to see the young man standing, wiping his hands on a towel.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""I'm looking for the kitchen.""

The young man nodded and followed her. He was tall, with a lean build and long arms. His skin had a grayish cast to it.

""You're new here?"" Nora asked.

He shook his head. ""No, I've been here a while. But I haven't seen you around before.""

Nora shrugged. ""I just started last week. You can tell me about the colony when we get there. We'll be eating breakfast in the cafeteria soon.""

""Oh. Okay."" He looked at Nora's jacket. ""What's your job? Are you an engineer?""

""Yeah. I'm a mechanic.""

He nodded. ""That's cool. I'm a geologist. It's nice working with engineers and scientists. They know how to fix things.""

Nora smiled. ""Well, I hope so."" She paused. ""How are you fixing things right now?""

""I'm not. The system is down again.""

""Oh."" Nora frowned, then looked up. ""Can you show me where it is?""

The young man pointed to a door on the other side of the hall. ""It's over there. I'll meet you in the cafeteria after I finish my cereal.""

Nora nodded and walked away. The boy watched her go, then turned back toward his food.

She passed through the kitchen and entered a long corridor. At the end of the hallway was another set of doors.

168,0.3,0.8,1.0,95.0,4,46.0,"The colony's main hall was empty except for a few colonists moving about their business. The hall stretched long and wide, its walls lined with doors leading to the various rooms of the colony. At the far end of the hall, a large window looked out over the landscape.

Nora walked past the windows to the door at the opposite end of the hall. She opened it to find the corridor beyond filled with people. They were busy, but not so busy that they didn't notice her standing there.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm supposed to be on duty in the command center.""

A man with dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard turned from where he was talking to another colonist. He nodded toward Nora.

""You're late, Decker.""

Nora shrugged. ""My alarm didn't go off until just now.""

The bearded man frowned. ""That's not what I meant. You're supposed to start your shift in ten minutes. Get going.""

Nora sighed and rolled her eyes. ""Fine. But if you want me to do my job, don't make me wait around for it.""

She stalked away, leaving the other colonists staring after her.

Nora walked down the hall to the stairs leading up to the command center. She passed through the double doors and started climbing the metal steps. The stairwell was dimly lit with emergency lighting, which cast a sickly yellow glow across the walls. It wasn't enough to see by, but it helped Nora keep her bearings.

The stairs ended at a door with an electronic keypad. Nora punched in the code to open it. A loud click sounded from inside the room.

Nora pushed into the command center. The room was small and cramped, with only one window looking out over the landscape. The room had a low ceiling and a single desk. Atop the desk sat a man in a dark suit sitting behind a computer monitor. He looked up when Nora entered.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""I'm Commander Valentina Kern.""

Nora nodded. She didn't know who this person was, but she knew his name. She'd heard it before.

""You're late,"" the man continued.

Nora shrugged. ""My alarm didn't go off until just now.""

The commander frowned. ""That's not what I meant. You're supposed to start your shift in ten minutes. Get going.""

Nora sighed and rolled her eyes. ""Fine. But if you want me to do my job, don't make me wait around for it.""

Nora walked past the rows of dark rooms until she reached the kitchen. She opened the door and entered the room. A young woman in a blue jumpsuit sat at a table, eating a bowl of cereal.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm sorry I'm late.""

The other girl looked up from her bowl. Her hair was short and blond, with a streak of red that ran through it like a river. She had green eyes and freckles across her nose.

""You're not late,"" the girl replied, setting down her spoon. She wiped her mouth with a napkin and stood. ""I've been here since six o'clock this morning. You can eat if you want.""

Nora nodded. She took the seat opposite the girl and picked up her own spoon. The girl's name was Shauna, but Nora didn't know why. Shauna seemed too young for the job.

Shauna returned to her breakfast. Nora tried to ignore the way the other girl's movements were so precise and efficient. She ate quickly and efficiently, almost mechanically.

Nora finished first. She pushed back her chair and stood. ""Thanks,"" she said. ""I'll see you later.""

""Sure thing. Have a good shift.""

Nora left the room and walked down the hallway. The colonists'quarters were arranged in a series of long, narrow rooms that ran parallel to each other along one side of the building. Each room was about ten meters wide and twenty meters deep. A row of doors lined the far wall, where the hall ended at a small kitchenette.

The corridor Nora entered was dimly lit and empty. She stepped into the room and closed the door behind her. It clicked shut with a heavy thud.

Nora exhaled slowly, trying to calm her racing heart. Her eyes darted around the dark room, searching for something to focus on. The walls were bare and featureless. There were no windows or decorations.

She felt exposed and vulnerable. She couldn't see anything.

Nora took a few steps forward, then stopped. She turned to face the door again and put her hand on it. She pressed her ear to the cold metal surface, listening intently.

Nothing. No sound came through the thick steel.

Nora let out a slow breath. She was alone in this room.

Nora walked to the center of the room, where a single light fixture hung from the ceiling. She reached up and touched the switch. The bulb flickered on, illuminating the space with a soft yellow glow.

The room was small but well designed. The floor was made of smooth gray concrete, and the walls were painted a dull green. A metal table sat in the middle of the room. On top of it rested an old digital clock.

Nora picked up the clock and examined it. It had been manufactured a century ago, when technology was still primitive. The device was heavy and clunky. Nora set it back down and looked around again.

She checked her watch. She'd been here for almost two hours already.

She stopped at the end of each hall to check the time on her wristwatch. After five minutes, she reached the cafeteria. The door was open, but no one was inside. A few tables were scattered about, but the room was empty except for Nora.

Nora sighed in relief. She had been worried that the colonists wouldn't be awake yet, but it seemed they were already eating breakfast.

The cafeteria was small, with a long line of tables and chairs. At the far end, the cooks stood behind the counter, taking orders. Nora waved to them as she passed. They nodded back.

""Good morning,"" said a voice from behind her.

Nora turned around in surprise. ""You're up early.""

A man wearing a crisp white uniform smiled at her. He held out his hand. ""I'm Captain Kincaid. I'll be your supervisor today.""

Nora shook his hand and returned the smile. She was surprised to find him so young. ""Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Nora Decker. You can call me Nora. Everyone does.""

""Very good, Nora. I'll see you at the start of shift. Don't forget to bring your work tablet.""

Nora nodded. ""Yes, sir.""

Captain Kincaid left the cafeteria. Nora watched him go, then turned back toward her table. She took a seat and waited for the cook to finish serving breakfast.

The food was hot, but not too spicy. Nora ate quickly, finishing before the other colonists arrived. She washed down each bite with a swig of water from a plastic cup.

Nora finished her meal and pushed her plate away. The cooks had already cleared the tables and were busying themselves in another part of the cafeteria. Nora stood up and stretched.

She walked over to the exit, which opened into the courtyard beyond. It was a large space, surrounded on three sides by buildings. A few people sat at the benches scattered about, reading or talking.

Nora stepped outside and looked around. She was alone.

""Hello?"" she called out. ""Anybody here?""

The colonists didn't answer. Nora frowned, wondering if they'd gone back to sleep. But no, the cafeteria door opened again and a group of people came through it. Nora recognized them from the night before.

She smiled at the sight of the women and men who made up her work crew. They were dressed in their usual clothes—the same ones Nora wore herself.

Nora waved to the workers, who returned the gesture. As the colonists passed her table, one of them stopped and spoke. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora nodded. ""Morning, Jules. How's your arm?""

Jules held up his right hand and wiggled the fingers. ""It hurts like hell, but I'll be fine. Thanks for asking.""

""You're welcome,"" Nora said. She turned back toward the cafeteria.

A man in a white uniform approached her.

Nora walked quickly through the dormitories, past the communal showers, and toward the cafeteria. She passed a few people working on their own projects, but most of the colonists were already at work.

The cafeteria was empty except for one woman sitting alone at a table near the back. Nora recognized her from the night before as a young engineer named Lianna. Nora stopped to talk to her, but Lianna didn't look up. Her eyes were fixed on the tabletop, where she was drawing something with a stylus.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""I'm sorry I missed your party last night.""

Lianna looked up, her face pale and drawn. She blinked rapidly, then nodded stiffly. ""No problem.""

Nora sat across from her. ""Are you okay?""

""Yeah, just tired.""

""You don't have to go if you're not feeling well.""

Lianna shook her head. ""It's fine. I'll be fine. It's just been a rough couple of days.""

Nora didn't know what to say. She was too busy trying to figure out how to get through the day without being eaten alive.

""How are things going with Sully?"" Lianna asked, changing the subject.

""He's good,"" Nora said. ""We've got a lot of work to do today.""

""That's great. I'm glad he's doing so well.""

""Me, too,"" Nora agreed. She paused for a moment, then added, ""I think he likes me.""

""Well, I'm sure he does."" Lianna smiled faintly. ""He's very nice.""

Nora felt a twinge of jealousy. She'd never had anyone like Sully before. He was kind and smart, with an easy smile and an infectious laugh. Nora liked him a lot.

She took a deep breath. ""I'll see you later,"" she said.

Lianna nodded, then returned to her drawing.

Nora left the cafeteria and headed back toward the dormitories. She passed a few people working on their own projects. Most of the colonists were already at work.

Nora walked past the communal showers, where the steamy mist hung heavy over the floor. The air was thick with the smell of wet metal and soap.

The corridors were dimly lit, but Nora could still make out the outlines of the colonists'bodies under the sheets. She saw a man sleeping soundly, his head resting on the pillow beside a woman curled up in a fetal position. A young girl slept alone, her arms wrapped around a stuffed animal.

Nora stopped to look at them for a moment. She wondered what they were dreaming about. What did they think of when they closed their eyes?

She shook herself and continued walking.

Her quarters were near the end of the hall. Nora stepped inside, shut the door, then leaned back against it. Her room was small and cramped, with a narrow bed tucked into one corner and a desk in the other. There wasn't much furniture aside from a chair and a table.

Nora sighed, then sat down at her desk. She pulled out a notepad and began to write.

To my dearest Sully,

I hope this letter finds you well.

Nora walked past the rows of rooms, feeling the cold air on her face as she passed the doorways. The colony's architecture was designed to be efficient but not spacious. Each room had a small desk, chair, and bed. Most people slept alone.

Nora paused at the end of the hallway to check her wristwatch. She'd been working late again, and it was already midmorning. Her stomach grumbled in anticipation of food.

She turned right, heading for the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was located on the opposite side of the main concourse from the dormitories. It was a large open space with a long counter and tables that seated several dozen people. The tables were made of metal plates bolted together. They were sturdy, but they weren't meant for comfort.

Nora stepped inside the cavernous room, which was dimly lit by emergency lighting. She saw a few colonists sitting at the tables, eating breakfast. Most of them glanced up at her entrance, then returned to their meals.

Nora took a seat at one of the empty tables. The cafeteria was filled with an assortment of smells and sounds. A woman in the corner was loudly complaining about her meal. Another man was laughing at something his friend said. A young girl sat alone reading a book, and a couple of men played cards.

Nora looked around the room, noticing the people who didn't seem to be talking or eating. She wondered what they did here.

The cafeteria was quiet. No one spoke. Everyone seemed preoccupied with their own thoughts.

Nora's stomach rumbled again, and she realized she hadn't eaten since breakfast. She ordered a bowl of cereal from the automated dispenser and ate it standing at the counter while she waited for her food.

She finished her meal quickly, then walked out into the corridor. The clock on the wall read 10: 30 AM. She'd been working late again.

Nora turned right, heading toward the dormitories. As she passed the cafeteria, a man in a dark suit appeared at the end of the hallway. He stood there for a moment, watching her go.

Nora felt her heart skip a beat. Her pulse quickened. She stopped walking and stared at him.

The man was tall, with black hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His eyes were dark brown and intense, and he wore an expensive-looking suit. He wasn't a Company employee; he was a stranger.

He watched Nora until she moved away from the cafeteria. Then he stepped back into the shadows of the hall and disappeared.

Nora's mind raced. She couldn't believe her eyes. The man had just been standing in the hallway, but now he was gone.

She shook her head and tried to convince herself she must have imagined it. But she knew what she saw. The man had been real.

173,0.3,0.9,1.0,80.0,4,45.0,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights spaced every few meters along the walls. The air smelled stale, but not unpleasant. A few colonists walked past her in their pajamas, yawning and rubbing eyes.

Nora paused at the end of the corridor to check her watch. She was almost late.

She turned right and headed toward the cafeteria. The hallways were lined with doors leading to the dormitories, labs, and other facilities. Nora passed several closed doors. As she approached the cafeteria, the chirping alarm sounded again.

Nora sighed. She hated this part of her job. It was always the same. She had to walk through the halls, checking each door in turn. If the alarm went off, she would have to go back and check the rooms. That meant going down the hallway again.

It was a long, tedious process. And it got worse when the alarms went off frequently.

Nora shook her head. She didn't want to think about the problem. She needed to focus on something else. Something more pleasant. Like breakfast.

The cafeteria was located at the end of the main corridor. It was a large room with long tables and benches, where colonists ate meals together. The space was brightened by overhead fluorescent lights and white walls decorated with colorful posters of planets and starships.

Nora entered the cafeteria and spotted her friend, Dr. Chen, sitting alone at one of the tables. She waved to get the doctor's attention.

Dr. Rowena Chen smiled and nodded. She was an attractive woman in her mid-thirties with dark hair pulled into a tight bun. Her eyes were intelligent, but her face showed signs of stress. She wore a lab coat over her nightclothes and carried a clipboard in her hand.

""Good morning, Nora,"" she said. ""I hope you slept well.""

Nora shrugged. ""Not really.""

""What do you mean?"" asked the doctor. ""You're always so cheerful. I'm sure you had a good time last night.""

Nora grinned. ""That's not what I meant. It was just... hard work. And I was tired.""

Rowena looked at her with concern. ""Are you okay? You look pale.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, it's nothing. Just a little tired. But I'll be fine. I've been working too much lately. I need some sleep. That's why I came down here early.""

The doctor nodded. ""I understand. Well, let me know if anything comes up. We'll have to get together soon for a progress report.""

Nora nodded and walked away from the table. She passed several colonists eating breakfast and headed toward the cafeteria's exit.

She paused at the door and glanced back. Dr. Chen was still sitting alone at her table, looking very serious. Nora felt a pang of guilt. Her friend seemed so sad.

Nora sighed and turned away.

It took only ten minutes to walk the length of the colony. She checked each room in turn before returning to the cafeteria. The alarm sounded again.

Nora groaned. She hated this part. It was always the same.

174,0.3,0.9,1.0,80.0,3,45.0,"The colony's main hall was empty except for a few colonists heading to the mess hall. The halls were dimly lit, but the lights glowed brightly enough to illuminate the way.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria where she could grab a quick meal and then head back to her lab. Her boots clacked loudly on the metal grating covering the walkways, echoing off the walls of the corridors.

The air was dry and cold, but Nora didn't mind. She had grown up in the desert. She knew how to dress for the climate.

She passed the command center, which was dark and silent. A lone guard stood at attention outside the door, his rifle slung over one shoulder.

Nora nodded to him as she passed, but he gave no response. He just stared straight ahead with eyes that seemed to be staring through her.

Ahead, the mess hall was a large room filled with tables and chairs. The tables were covered in long metal trays and the chairs were bolted to the floor. The tables were crowded with colonists who were already eating breakfast.

Nora walked past them, shoving her way into the line. She grabbed a tray and a cup of coffee from the dispenser before sitting down.

The food was good. It smelled fresh and hot. But Nora didn't have time to enjoy it. She gulped the coffee and shoved her plate away.

She was halfway through her second cup when a drone appeared out of nowhere and landed on the table next to her. The drone was about the size of a small dog, but its body was sleek and sinuous like an insect's. Its carapace was black, shiny, and smooth. Its head was flat, featureless, and round with two glowing red eyes.

Nora froze. Her heart pounded in her chest as she stared at the creature. She tried to stand, but the chair was bolted down.

The drone cocked its head and regarded Nora with its strange eyes. Then it spoke in a voice that sounded like the rustling of dry leaves.

""You are not a native.""

Nora couldn't move or speak. The drone was speaking English, but the words were distorted and guttural.

""Are you human?"" the drone asked.

Nora nodded dumbly.

The drone stood up and walked toward her. Nora watched it warily. She could smell something foul in the air around it.

It reached out a clawed hand and grabbed her wrist. Nora screamed. The drone pulled her to her feet with one powerful tug. It held her arm out straight, so that her forearm was parallel to the floor.

""What is your name?"" the drone demanded.

Nora stared at its face. ""My name? I'm...""

She wasn't sure what to say. She had never met anyone like this before. The drone's expressionless face seemed to be staring right through her.

The drone let go of Nora's arm and stepped back. It turned away from her, then looked back at her with its red eyes.

""I am called the Master,"" it said. ""We will meet again soon.""

175,0.3,0.9,1.0,78.0,5,41.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty except for a few colonists still asleep. The halls were dimly lit by the occasional flickering glow from the emergency lights.

The colony's power plant was located in the center of the complex, near the garage and engineering bays. Nora walked past the dormitories, heading toward the command center. She passed several other colonists who were already up and about. They nodded to Nora as she passed them.

Nora's boots clacked on the metal flooring, echoing through the corridors. She reached the command center without incident.

Valentina Kern was standing at the entrance to the command center. Valentina wore a dark blue uniform with gold trim. Her long black hair hung loose around her shoulders, and her face was pale and drawn. She looked tired but alert.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm glad you're awake.""

Valentina smiled thinly, her eyes darting nervously. ""Yes, I am. Thank you, Nora. Good morning, everyone.""

Nora nodded back. ""Morning. Is everything okay?""

""No,"" Valentina answered. ""We've got a problem. A big one. We need your help. Please come with me.""

Nora followed Valentina into the command center. The room was large and well lit by banks of monitors and screens. There were no windows, just an array of consoles and workstations.

A small group of colonists stood around the central console, talking in hushed tones. They turned to look at Nora as she entered.

Valentina gestured to the others and they stepped aside. She led Nora over to the console and motioned for her to sit down.

Nora sat down and watched Valentina study the monitor displays. The woman's fingers moved quickly across the keyboard, typing commands into the system.

""What is it?"" Nora asked. ""Is everything okay?""

Valentina shook her head. ""No. Everything isn't okay. I think we're under attack.""

Nora frowned. ""By who? What do you mean?""

""I don't know,"" Valentina answered. ""But the drones are here.""

The colonists murmured among themselves, their faces grim and pale.

Nora looked at Valentina. ""Drones?""

Valentina nodded. ""Yes. We've been attacked by a swarm of drones. They're hiding underground, but they're coming up through the vents and tunnels in the rock.""

""How many?"" Nora asked.

""We can't tell,"" Valentina answered. ""There could be hundreds or thousands. I'm not sure how they got past our security systems. The drones have no physical bodies, so they must have some kind of cloaking technology to hide from radar. Our sensors aren't picking them up. And there's something else. They're intelligent. They communicate with each other. Some of the drones are communicating with us.""

Nora frowned. ""Are you saying they're talking?""

""No, not exactly. It's more like a hive mind. The drones are communicating with each other and then relaying information back to the colony. We've recorded several conversations.

176,0.3,0.9,1.0,90.0,4,46.0,"The corridors were empty except for the occasional colonists heading to their duties. The air was crisp and fresh, but it carried a hint of something foul in its metallic tang.

Nora followed the smell to the cafeteria where she found the other members of her team already gathered around the long tables. They sat at one end of the room, eating eggs and bacon while they waited for the food to be served.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted them as she took a seat at the table.

""Morning.""

""I see you're up early today. Did the alarm wake you?""

""Yeah, I just got out of bed. I'm starving.""

Nora grinned. ""Me too. Let's eat.""

The meal was simple but filling. Nora ate quickly, then excused herself from the table to go back to her quarters. She wanted to get a shower and change into more comfortable clothes before starting work.

She paused in front of the mirror, checking her appearance. Her dark hair had been pulled back into a ponytail and secured with a rubber band, leaving her face bare. A few strands fell across her eyes, but she didn't bother trying to push them aside.

Her green eyes were bright and alert, and her skin was pale and clear. Nora looked like she belonged here.

Nora turned away from the mirror and headed for the showers. She needed to wash off the sweat of her shift before she started working on the next problem.

The shower felt good. Nora scrubbed the grime and dust from her body with a rough brush, rinsing it down with warm water until the last traces of grit disappeared. Then she stepped out into the steamy room and toweled dry.

Nora dressed in clean clothes, then went to the kitchen to grab a breakfast bar from the dispenser. She took her time eating while she watched the other colonists come and go.

When she finished, Nora walked back to the cafeteria to find most of her team already gone. The only ones left were the two engineers who had been assigned to help her.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted them as she sat at one end of the table.

""Morning.""

The two men nodded to her, then returned to their food. Nora ate in silence, watching them. She wasn't sure what she was looking for.

It didn't take long before the engineer on her right spoke up. ""So how are we doing?""

Nora blinked. She hadn't expected him to ask. ""We're fine. We've got a few problems, but nothing too serious.""

The man nodded and glanced over his shoulder. His companion had already finished eating and stood up. He was tall and lean with dark hair and eyes.

""I'll see you later,"" he said.

Nora watched him leave, then turned back to her meal.

She finished eating quickly and walked back to the cafeteria, where she found the other engineer sitting alone at the table. She sat down across from him.

""How's it going?""

177,0.3,0.9,1.0,83.0,4,44.0,"The hallway was empty. The colonists were still asleep. Nora walked briskly to the cafeteria, where she found a line of people waiting for food. She joined the end of it, taking her place in line as the others shuffled forward.

It wasn't long until the first person ahead of her got their meal. A young woman in a blue jumpsuit with short, spiky hair took a tray from the serving robot and sat down at one of the tables. Nora watched her eat.

She looked like a teenager. Maybe younger than Nora. But she ate quickly with efficient movements, pausing only to take small sips of water. She didn't seem to notice the other patrons watching her.

Nora glanced around, but no one seemed to be paying attention to her. She was just another face in the crowd. She turned back to watch the girl.

The girl finished eating and pushed the tray away. Her eyes flicked toward Nora, then away again. She stood up without a word and left.

Nora stared after her for a moment, then shrugged. It was probably nothing.

She picked up her tray and continued on to the cafeteria's kitchen. The food smelled good.

The kitchen was a large room with a high ceiling, filled with long stainless steel counters and racks of shelves holding pots, pans, and utensils. A row of industrial ovens lined one wall, while a bank of refrigerators and freezers occupied the opposite side.

Ahead of Nora, a line of colonists waited in front of a serving robot. She joined them, taking her tray and placing it on the conveyor belt.

""Good morning,"" said a man behind her. He wore an engineer's uniform with a white shirt, black pants, and boots. His hair was dark brown and curly.

Nora turned to look at him. ""Morning.""

He smiled. ""I'm Sully Carmichael. I work in the power plant.""

She nodded. ""Nora Decker. I'm an engineer.""

Sully held out his hand. Nora shook it.

""You're a mechanic?"" he asked.

""Yeah. My specialty is repairing machinery. But I've also worked on the power plants before.""

""That's good."" He gestured toward the serving robot. ""Grab some food and come with me. We'll talk about your shift.""

Nora followed him into a small office near the cafeteria. The walls were covered in charts and graphs, while a large window looked out over the colony grounds.

Sully sat down behind a desk. Nora took a seat across from him.

""So what's the deal with this shift?"" Sully asked.

""Well..."" Nora hesitated. She wasn't sure how much to tell him. ""It's not my fault.""

""What isn't? Your equipment malfunctioning?""

She shrugged. ""No. Well, yes. But it's not just the equipment.""

Sully raised an eyebrow. ""Go on.""

Nora sighed and rubbed her eyes. ""The drones are coming for us.""

""Drones?"" Sully leaned back in his chair. He crossed one leg over the other and folded his hands on top of them. ""Are you serious?""

""Yes.""

178,0.3,0.9,1.0,87.0,4,51.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by a few glow strips spaced evenly along the ceiling, but the lights were bright enough to see by. The walls were lined with doors leading to other parts of the colony. Nora walked past the dormitories on one side, then turned right at the end of the hall. She passed a small rec room where colonists gathered to play games, read, or watch holovids.

Ahead was the cafeteria, which was open for business. Nora entered the room through the door marked 'Employees Only'. A long counter ran along the back wall with several stools. At the front was a serving line that led to tables and chairs. There were no customers yet, so she took a seat in a booth near the back of the room and waited.

The food was good, but it wasn't worth missing her shift. Nora ate quickly, washing down the last bite with a swig from a bottle of water. She left the table and headed back toward the dormitory wing.

Nora paused at the entrance to the hallway and looked around. She could hear voices coming from the rec room, and wondered if anyone else had been up late working on their projects.

She stepped inside and saw a few people sitting in the corner. One of them was talking with a tall woman wearing a black uniform. Nora recognized her as one of the Company representatives who visited the colony once every month or two to check on progress. The representative wore glasses, and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun.

The other colonists were silent. They sat at the tables with their heads bowed. Nora walked over to the table where the representative was seated. She was a middle aged man, his face thin and lined. He was speaking with a young woman in a white lab coat.

""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""We're running behind schedule.""

The young woman nodded, her expression grim. Nora recognized her from the cafeteria. She was a scientist named Dr. Chen.

""You'll be finished soon,"" the man assured her. ""Just give us another day or two and we can get you back on track.""

Dr. Chen shook her head. ""That's not good enough. We need to finish this project today.""

The man frowned. ""What do you mean? You've already completed your work for the month. We have more than enough supplies to last until next month.""

Nora stepped forward. She didn't like the way the conversation was going, but it was too late now.

""I don't think so,"" Nora said. ""I'm an engineer. I know how much time and resources go into a project. If you want to keep working on this, you'll have to start from scratch.""

The man and the woman looked at each other. The representative spoke first. ""Are you sure?""

""Yes,"" Nora replied. ""I'm positive.""

The man sighed. ""Very well. We'll begin again from the beginning. But if we run out of materials, you'll have to find some elsewhere.""

""Of course,"" Nora said. ""Thank you.""

She turned and walked away. As she did, the representative called after her. ""I'm sorry about this.""

Nora stopped and turned back. She didn't like the way the man was looking at her.

179,0.4,0.4,1.0,83.0,4,44.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by the light of a few emergency lamps spaced along its length. The walls were made up of long, narrow panels that curved inward at the top to form a dome over the hallway. A series of small lights hung from the ceiling at regular intervals.

Ahead, the automated doors opened onto the common area where the colonists ate. Nora paused to take in the scene. The dining hall was crowded with people who had been awake for hours already. Many of them were still dressed in their sleepwear. Others sat around tables, eating from trays.

Nora spotted the cafeteria's cook, a short, plump woman whose name she didn't know, bustling through the crowd. She wore faded blue coveralls and a white apron. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun, and her cheeks were flushed red. She carried a tray laden with steaming plates of food and passed it to the next person in line.

The diners paid no attention to Nora as they shuffled past her toward the service counter, but she caught a whiff of something foul that lingered on the air. It smelled like spoiled meat or rotten fruit.

She stepped closer to get a better look at what was going down. The cook had stopped at one of the tables and was working quickly to serve breakfast to several people who had gathered there. But the smell was coming from the plate in front of the first diner.

The man sitting across from the cook looked up from his meal. His eyes were sunken, and he stared vacantly at nothing. He had an unkempt beard and matted hair, and his clothes hung off him in tatters. Nora recognized the man immediately.

""Hello,"" she said. ""What's wrong with your friend?""

The man turned to stare at her. His vacant expression didn't change. Nora took another step forward.

""Hey!"" She put a hand on his shoulder. ""You okay? What happened to you?""

The man continued to stare blankly ahead. Nora tried shaking him, but he didn't react.

Nora glanced around the room. No one else seemed to notice anything amiss. A few people were staring at her, but they averted their gazes when she met their eyes.

Nora ran a hand through her hair and sighed. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have woken you.""

A soft chime sounded from somewhere overhead. The automated doors opened, and the crowd shuffled outside. Nora stepped out into the corridor and followed them.

Outside, the air was crisp with morning dew. Nora shivered in the cold. She pulled her jacket closer around herself and hurried toward the cafeteria.

As she approached, the cook looked up from her work. Her face was pale with worry. ""Are you okay?"" Nora asked.

""Yeah,"" the woman said. ""I just... I don't know. Something's wrong with him.""

""What do you mean?"" Nora asked.

The cook shook her head. ""It's not right. He looks like he's been sick, but he hasn't vomited or anything. It's more like...""

180,0.4,0.4,1.0,70.0,4,45.0,"The colony's main hall consisted of a long, narrow corridor lined with doors. Most colonists were already awake and busy. Nora spotted a few people working in the engineering bays next to the power plant. A group of scientists huddled around a table in one of the labs.

She passed through the main hall, heading for the cafeteria. The hall opened up into the large central concourse, where she found several tables filled with colonists eating breakfast. Nora walked over to a nearby table and took a seat at the end opposite the door.

The colonists here were mostly men, but there was also a scattering of women among them. Nora spotted Sully Carmichael sitting alone, reading a book. He looked up as Nora approached and smiled politely.

""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning, Director,"" Nora replied with a nod. ""I'm hungry. Do you know when we'll be resupplied?""

Sully nodded. ""We should have fresh food and water delivered today. I'll let the comms team know.""

Nora glanced around. ""Where's Chen? She's usually here first thing in the morning.""

""Rowena's not feeling well this morning, so she sent me to handle things in her place. You can take the day off if you want. We don't need your help until tonight anyway.""

""Thanks, but no thanks. I'll get started on my work. Besides, it looks like the drones are getting more aggressive again. I'll be ready for them.""

Sully gave her a sympathetic look. ""You're right. It gets worse every time. The Company has been trying to figure out how to deal with them, but they just keep coming back.""

""They must be pretty smart. They've got some kind of AI running their colony.""

""That's what we think, too. But we haven't figured out how to stop them yet. And now we've got the aliens sneaking into our tunnels under the ground.""

Nora frowned. ""What do you mean?""

Sully gestured toward the cafeteria's entrance. ""The colonists were attacked last night. Someone tried to sneak in through the ventilation shafts and blew a hole in the wall. We found the bodies of two men down there this morning.""

""Show me,"" Nora said.

She followed Sully to the door where he pointed. A few colonists stood around the opening, staring at something inside.

Nora peered over Sully's shoulder. The floor was littered with broken glass, pieces of metal, and blood. The air reeked with the stench of death.

""It looks like they were killed in a fight,"" Sully said. ""But we don't know who did it.""

""Who would attack us? The Company?""

Sully shook his head. ""I doubt it's anyone from here, but I can't say for sure. We'll have to send someone out to investigate.""

Nora glanced back at the corridor behind her. ""Can we get any closer?""

Sully nodded.

Nora paused at the end of a hall to pull on her boots, then headed toward the mess hall. She was halfway there when she heard the alarm again.

The sound echoed through the corridor, reverberating off the walls like a siren. Nora nearly jumped out of her skin. Her heart pounded in her chest. She turned to run back to her room, but a hand clamped down on her shoulder from behind.

Valentina Kern was standing right behind her.

""What is it?"" Nora asked breathlessly. ""Why are we being attacked? What happened?""

""We're under attack,"" Valentina said tersely. ""Get your ass in gear.""

Nora gulped, trying to push down the panic rising inside her. She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself.

She nodded. ""Yes, ma'am. I'm on my way.""

Valentina released her.

Nora started running again. She rounded the corner and saw several colonists milling about in the middle of the hall. They looked confused. Some were talking in hushed tones. Others stood still, staring into space.

Nora stopped short. A woman lay on the floor nearby, curled up in a fetal position with her arms wrapped around her head. She was naked and shivering violently. Her eyes were wide open but unseeing.

A man stepped forward, his face pale and drawn. He held a weapon in both hands. ""What's going on?"" he demanded.

""I don't know,"" one of the men replied. ""We heard an alarm just now. We thought it was just another malfunction.""

The man shook his head. ""No, something's wrong.""

Nora stared at the prone figure. The woman had been lying there for hours. She didn't look injured. But then again, they'd only seen her from a distance. She could have been hurt when the alarm sounded.

Another man approached, holding a medical kit in one hand. ""What do we do?"" he asked. ""Should we call the medics?""

""We can't,"" Valentina said grimly. ""They're already here.""

Nora followed her gaze. A group of armed security officers stood near the entrance to the mess hall. They wore dark gray uniforms with black boots and belts. Their weapons were holstered at their sides, and each carried a small pistol in a holster under his arm.

""What happened?"" Nora demanded.

Valentina pointed toward the fallen woman. ""She was attacked. She's unconscious, but alive.""

Nora looked down at the woman. Her face was covered in blood and bruises, and her hair was matted with dried gore. ""Who is she? What's going on?""

""Her name is Dr. Annabelle Wills,"" Valentina answered. ""She's a botanist.""

Nora frowned. ""What does that mean?""

""It means she studies plants,"" Valentina said tersely. ""She's a specialist in the flora of this planet.""

182,0.4,0.4,1.0,87.0,3,45.0,"The corridors were empty except for Nora. The colonists'bodies were still sleeping, but their minds were awake. They'd be up soon, too.

Nora walked down the hall to the communal kitchen where she found a few other colonists already eating. She took her place at the end of the line, waiting patiently while others finished their breakfasts.

At last, the line moved forward. Nora reached for the food tray that had been placed in front of her with a muffled thud. After consuming the meal, she stood and returned to her quarters.

She sat on her bed and stared out the window, watching the sun rise over the horizon. She was alone with her thoughts.

Nora's parents worked long hours in the Company. Her father was a senior executive; her mother, an engineer. But when they came home, Nora was always there to greet them. When they weren't working late, they would play games, read books, or watch movies together.

They were good people. Nora missed them terribly.

But now Nora was all alone. She had no one to talk to about her work. No one to share her triumphs and failures. No one to help her through the dark times.

Nora felt like she was suffocating. She needed someone.

Someone to listen. Someone to tell her it wasn't her fault.

Someone who cared.

She knew what she wanted, but didn't know how to get it.

The door opened. A man stepped inside. Sully.

He wore his usual uniform of black pants, a white shirt, and a maroon tie with an orange pin that said 'Administrator'. He looked tired. His hair was disheveled from sleep.

""Good morning,"" he said, closing the door behind him. ""I'm sorry I woke you.""

Nora shrugged. She didn't care if he was sorry or not. She just wanted to be left alone. But Sully's warm smile made her feel guilty for being rude.

""How are you?"" he asked.

She sighed, stood up and walked over to him. She leaned down and kissed him on the cheek.

Sully smiled at her. ""You're a good girl. I appreciate that.""

Nora pulled away from him with a frown. She was confused. What did he mean? Why was she a good girl?

""Do you want to talk about it?"" he asked.

""About what?""

""Your shift. You look like you need some time off.""

""No, I don't...""

Nora paused, unsure of how to finish the sentence. She didn't want to be seen as a lazy engineer. But Sully was right. Her shift was starting soon.

""I'll see you later,"" he said, kissing her again before leaving.

Nora watched him go. She felt bad. He was trying to help her. But there was nothing he could do.

She had to get through the day.

* * *

The alarm went off with its usual chirping sound. Nora groaned and rolled out of bed, pulling on a pair of pants and boots before heading down to the mess hall.

After breakfast, Nora returned to her quarters to take a shower.

183,0.4,0.4,1.0,87.0,5,47.0,"She passed through the dormitory hallways where other colonists were waking up and heading to the communal dining room. A few glanced at Nora as she walked past. The colony was small, but there were plenty of people. And they were all alone on this planet.

The colonists weren't used to being around each other much. They didn't know how to interact with others without the benefit of modern conveniences like a shared bathroom, so most went about their business in private.

Nora was no exception. She didn't linger in the halls, nor did she stop to talk to anyone. She had work to do.

In the dining room, Nora found the tables already crowded. There were only two seats available at the counter. She took one, and waited for the rest of the colonists to fill the table.

A few minutes later, the last person sat down. Nora ordered a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee.

While waiting for her food, she watched the other colonists eat. Most of them were young, and not very experienced with eating in public. They didn't seem to realize they were supposed to talk to each other.

Nora was no different. She ate her breakfast quietly, watching everyone else.

The colonists were all dressed casually. Nora wore utility pants, a fitted shirt, and work boots. Her hair hung loose, framing her face. The dark circles under her eyes made her look exhausted. But she was tough. She'd been working hard on the colony's systems since she was little.

Nora finished her meal, then stood up to leave. She glanced at the clock hanging overhead. It was time to start her shift.

She headed back toward the dormitory hallways. As she walked, Nora felt exposed and vulnerable in her utilitarian clothes. She knew it wasn't safe to walk around the colony alone. But she didn't have anyone to accompany her.

It was just her and the colonists. And they were all too busy surviving to care about someone who might be lost or hurt.

Nora sighed and kept walking.

The corridor opened into a large, open space. The central concourse was an expanse of polished metal flooring, supported by tall pillars. At its center was a small control room.

At the far end of the concourse, a long row of doors led to various areas within the colony. Nora had seen most of them before. Most were empty and unused. Some of the rooms were still in construction, while others were already being used.

Nora hurried across the concourse. She stopped at the door to her own quarters and rapped on the frame with a knuckle. There was no answer from inside, so she pushed the door open and stepped through.

The dimly lit room smelled stale and musty. Nora dropped her tool belt onto the bed and took off the jacket, then hung it up. She set the tools down beside the bed and walked over to the window.

Outside, the sky was brightening to morning blue. The sun would rise soon.

Nora looked out at the distant cliffs. Her gaze followed their jagged edges to where they met the horizon.

184,0.4,0.4,1.0,87.0,5,45.0,"The colony's central corridor ended at a communal kitchen. The room was filled with long tables, each lined with several rows of chairs. At the far end of the room, a large window provided a view of the surrounding landscape. In the middle of the room was a raised platform where two chefs worked over an open grill. A handful of colonists sat around the tables, eating their breakfasts.

Nora walked up to the table next to the window and took a seat. She ordered a bowl of cereal from the server and watched the landscape roll past outside.

As she ate, Nora looked out the window. Just beyond the edge of the cliff, a narrow path wound its way down to the ground. It was barely visible, but the trail was there. Nora could see it now that she knew what to look for.

She finished her breakfast, washed out her bowl, and left the mess hall. She headed toward the command center, passing through the dormitories. As she neared the main concourse, she saw a group of colonists gathered there.

Nora slowed her pace and stopped. The colonists were clustered together in the middle of the concourse, talking animatedly. They were pointing at something on the floor. Nora couldn't make out anything from this distance, so she walked closer.

A few colonists noticed her approach, and they fell silent. Nora approached them cautiously. When she got close enough, she realized they were standing over a body. It was slumped across the floor, unmoving and covered with dust.

Nora stared down at it, then looked away. She felt sick to her stomach.

The colonists murmured among themselves. Nora turned back. The colonists had pulled the body out of one of the side corridors, but it was still lying on its face. Nora recognized the man from his uniform. He was a security guard who'd been assigned to the colony's outer perimeter.

""What happened?"" Nora asked. ""Who found him?""

No one answered her. Several colonists stepped forward, staring down at the corpse. One of them picked up a small device and held it over the body. A soft green light illuminated the scene. Nora watched as the colonists peered at the screen, their faces tight with worry.

Nora looked around for someone in charge. She needed answers. The colonists didn't seem willing to talk. Nora was about to ask them a second time when a woman wearing a Company suit appeared from the corridor leading into the command center. She walked briskly toward the group, her heels clicking on the metal flooring.

The colonists parted to let her through. Nora stood aside, watching the woman approach the body. The woman knelt down and examined the body with the same device the colonists had used. She looked up at the crowd, then spoke.

""We have a situation.""

The colonists listened intently as she described the incident. When she finished, the colonists began talking among themselves again. Nora watched the exchange, confused.

The woman rose to her feet and turned to face the crowd. ""I'm Captain Coyle,"" she said. ""This is my ship.

185,0.4,0.4,1.0,77.0,4,47.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by recessed lights set in the walls. The lighting was designed to conserve energy, but the shadows were still dark. She passed several colonists heading toward the cafeteria at the end of the hall.

Nora walked down the center of the hallway, stepping around others who were already there. A line formed behind a few people waiting for food. Nora joined it, shuffling forward with her tray. As she waited, she looked around at the other colonists.

Most of them wore similar clothing to hers. They were young adults like herself, but they weren't all that similar. There were two men and three women, and one of the women was pregnant. Nora didn't know any of their names.

She wasn't sure why, but every time Nora saw a new person, her heart skipped a beat. It was a strange, disconcerting feeling. She wondered if it was a side effect of being so isolated from the rest of humanity.

A man stood near the front of the line, his hands clasped in front of him. He was tall and thin with sharp features. His hair was short and black, and he had thick eyebrows. His clothes were loose and baggy, but the fabric looked expensive. He wore a silver pendant around his neck.

Nora found herself staring at the man. She couldn't help it. The way he held himself, the way he moved... Nora felt an odd sense of familiarity. He reminded her of someone she knew very well.

The man turned to look at Nora. Her pulse quickened. He smiled, and the resemblance vanished. But then Nora realized the man was looking right through her.

He was focused on something else. Nora felt a chill. Was he blind? Had he lost his eyesight?

""You're late,"" said a woman who stood behind Nora. She wore a bright red dress with a white collar, and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. ""I'm not going to wait much longer.""

Nora started to apologize but stopped when she saw the woman's expression. It was hard and cold. She almost seemed angry.

""It's okay,"" Nora said, trying to sound reassuring. ""I just got here myself. I'll be ready in a minute.""

The woman nodded curtly and walked away. Nora stood there for a moment, watching the backs of the people ahead of her. She was afraid the woman would come back to yell at her again.

Nora turned and hurried toward the cafeteria. The man had disappeared. Maybe he hadn't been looking at her at all. Maybe he'd just been distracted.

She hoped so.

The line moved quickly, and Nora was soon seated with her tray. She looked around nervously. Everyone else seemed to know what they were doing. But Nora wasn't sure how to eat this unfamiliar food. She didn't even know if it was edible.

A few colonists sat near her, talking quietly among themselves. One of them was a young man with dark hair and olive skin.

",-0.07193877551020378,-0.30795918367346853,0.01612244897959192
186,0.4,0.4,1.0,80.0,4,44.0,"The colony's common areas were mostly empty at this early hour. A few colonists sat around tables playing cards, reading, or catching up on the news. Others stood about in small groups talking quietly. Most of them ignored Nora as she walked past them.

She stopped by the cafeteria where she grabbed a bowl of cereal and filled it with milk, then headed back toward the dormitories. The walk was short enough that she could grab something to eat on the way.

The cafeteria was noisy and crowded. Nora took her seat at one of the long, wooden tables near the back. She slid the bowl across the table to a young woman who was sitting alone.

""Thanks,"" she said. ""I'm Nora.""

The other girl nodded. Her hair was dark blond, cut in a blunt bob, but her eyes were green. She wore a sleeveless top and loose shorts.

""Jenny,"" the girl replied. ""You're new?""

Nora nodded. ""Just got here last night.""

""Welcome!"" Jenny smiled brightly, revealing a gap between two front teeth. ""Did you get settled okay? I hope your room is comfortable.""

Nora shrugged. ""It's fine. It's not much different from my old place.""

""Oh, really? Well, if there's anything you need, just let me know! We're like a big family around here.""

""I'll do that. Thanks.""

They ate in silence for a while. Nora sipped her milk and watched the people milling about. The colony had been established on this remote planet because it was the only habitable world within a hundred light years of Earth. But colonists didn't live forever.

She wondered what life would be like after she died. Would they even notice?

Nora finished her cereal and set the bowl down. She stood up, grabbed her jacket, and headed out the door.

The corridor outside was dimly lit with a few overhead lights. Nora walked along it at a brisk pace, passing through a series of doors until she reached the exit leading into the main concourse.

A few colonists were already gathered there. They greeted Nora cheerfully, but she ignored them. Her eyes scanned the area and found the command center. The building looked like an oversized bunker, its walls lined with reinforced windows and blast doors.

Nora entered the building, which was a maze of corridors and rooms. She made her way to a small office where she signed in at a computer terminal. The screen displayed a list of names and room assignments. Nora's name was listed under the dormitory section. She checked the map. It showed the layout of the colony.

At the end of the hall, she turned left and started walking toward the dormitories. She passed several other colonists. Most of them nodded or smiled, but one man watched her with a frown. He was tall and muscular, with dark hair that fell over his face in a tousled mess.

Nora glanced at him, then continued past. She didn't know why he bothered her. Maybe it was just the way he stared. Or maybe it had something to do with the fact that she'd seen him earlier, when she went for breakfast.

He followed her, but Nora kept moving.

",-0.07193877551020378,-0.30795918367346853,0.01612244897959192
187,0.4,0.4,1.0,65.0,6,45.0,"The dormitories were already awake, filled with colonists bustling about their business. The hallways echoed with the clatter of boots and voices. A few people paused to talk quietly, but most moved on quickly as they got ready for work.

Nora was not the only engineer in the colony. She knew of at least two others. But she was the best, and the Company wanted her for its latest project.

She was a specialist in high tech systems, particularly those of advanced robotics. With the Company's backing, Nora had been able to design and build her own robot, which was now part of the colony's security force.

Nora walked down one corridor, then another, heading toward the command center where her shift would begin. She passed several other engineers who nodded greetings and smiled in passing. Most of them wore similar clothes. They were all busy preparing for work.

The corridors were narrow and dimly lit, and Nora had to duck her head as she hurried past the lower level of the dormitories. The dorms were located belowground and connected by a series of long, winding stairs that climbed through the rock face.

At the top, the corridors opened up into the main concourse. Nora followed the wide path until it intersected with the central hallway that led to the command center. She paused there, looking around at the crowd of people moving along the hallways.

The colony was a small community and everyone knew everyone else. The colonists worked together as a team, but they also lived and slept together in close quarters. Nora had spent most of her life on ships, so this was an adjustment for her.

A few moments later, she entered the command center. A large, open space filled with rows of desks and chairs, the command center was busy and crowded. People moved about and talked quietly while others sat at their workstations.

Nora found a seat near the front of the room and waited patiently for her shift to begin. She glanced over at the clock mounted on the wall. Her shift would last four hours, and she had plenty of time to get ready.

She stretched out in her chair and leaned back, resting her hands behind her head. The soft fabric of her shirt rubbed against the nape of her neck as she relaxed.

The door opened, and two colonists came in carrying trays laden with food and drink. They set down the trays and began distributing cups of coffee or tea to the employees. Nora took a cup and sipped it gratefully.

The colonists were friendly enough, but Nora didn't know them well. She was used to working alone. And the colony was small enough that everyone knew each other's business.

After a moment, one of the colonists approached her. He was tall and thin with dark hair cut short in military style. His eyes were a sharp green and his mouth was firm.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said pleasantly. ""I'm Captain Jansen.""

Nora nodded politely. She recognized him from the Company personnel list.

""Hello, Captain,"" she replied.

Jansen smiled at her.

188,0.4,0.5,1.0,86.0,4,48.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by a few emergency lights. The walls were lined with doors that opened to rooms and hallways. Some doors had frosted windows, while others were solid steel. A few colonists sat at tables in the common room, chatting quietly as they read or played games.

Nora passed several people on her way to the mess hall. They nodded to her, but she didn't speak. She wanted to be alone when she ate. Her stomach growled at the prospect of food.

The mess hall was a large, open area filled with long tables arranged in rows. The ceiling was high enough that the tables were set back from the wall to allow for natural ventilation. A row of small, round windows provided light and allowed a view out into the night.

A line of colonists shuffled forward toward one of the serving stations. Nora joined them, leaning over the counter as she waited her turn.

""Hey, Nora,"" said a man with dark skin and curly hair. ""You're up early.""

Nora looked up to see a young man in his midtwenties with a friendly smile. She returned it, though her expression was unreadable.

""Yeah, I'm just heading out to help fix the alarm system.""

""I'll go with you.""

Nora hesitated. ""It's not necessary. You've got your shift to catch up on. I can handle this alone.""

The man shrugged, unconcerned. ""I don't mind helping. Besides, I like the idea of being useful for once. It'll do me good to stretch my legs.""

Nora nodded reluctantly. The young man grinned. He was right. She could use the company.

She followed him out into the night, and they walked together in silence. Nora tried to keep her eyes on the ground so she didn't have to look at the man.

As they approached the center of the colony, the man slowed down and glanced around. ""This is as far as we go,"" he said.

Nora stopped walking. ""What?""

""You know, the Company doesn't want us going any farther than this. They say it's too dangerous.""

""Why? What are you talking about?""

The man shrugged, but his expression was worried. ""I don't know. But I think they're trying to scare everyone away from the cliff face.""

Nora frowned. ""That's ridiculous. We've been here for years. There isn't anything out there.""

The man shook his head, looking troubled. ""I don't know. I just... feel it.""

Nora stared at him for a moment before turning back toward the colony. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. The man was obviously delusional.

""Let's get back to work.""

""Sure thing,"" said the man, and they continued on their way. Nora watched him go. He looked like he was in pain, but he kept up with her without complaint.

She turned around again, this time staring at the dark cliffs towering over the colony.

189,0.4,0.5,1.0,71.0,4,41.0,"The dormitory hallways were narrow, dimly lit, and lined by rows of single rooms with doors at the end of each hallway. The corridor walls were textured with grating and conduits to allow airflow while preventing dust from accumulating. The floors were metallic plates overlaid with a thin layer of gravel.

Nora walked briskly down the long corridors, her boots clacking on the metal grate. She passed several colonists in various states of dress or undress as she made her way to the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was large, open to the sky, and filled with tables for eating. A few colonists sat at one table, huddled around a small heater that warmed their hands. They wore clothes similar to Nora's but without the utility jackets and trousers.

Nora approached the serving line, where a young female clerk stood behind a counter. She had short dark hair and a cheerful smile. ""Good morning!"" she greeted Nora cheerfully.

""Morning,"" Nora replied.

The clerk pointed toward the serving area. ""I'll take your order.""

""Thanks."" Nora nodded and stepped up to the counter. The clerk placed Nora's breakfast on a tray, then handed it to her. She set down the tray and turned back to the serving area.

After setting down the tray, Nora returned to the counter. ""Anything else?"" she asked.

""No thanks."" Nora took her meal and walked over to one of the tables. Sitting down, she began to eat.

A few minutes later, the cafeteria doors opened. In stepped a tall man with dark skin and black hair. He wore a white shirt and pants, and carried a briefcase. The man's eyes were wide and startled as he scanned the room.

Nora glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. She was too focused on eating to care much about his reaction.

But the man's gaze settled on her. His expression softened, and he strode across the cafeteria toward her table. Nora didn't look up until she'd finished eating.

""Good morning,"" said the man. ""You're Nora, aren't you?""

Nora nodded and set her tray aside. She pushed herself to her feet. ""Yes.""

The man extended a hand. Nora shook it firmly. Her grip was firm but not calloused or rough like the hands of some colonists. The man's fingers were slender and smooth.

""I'm Dr. Jones."" He gestured toward the table where Nora had been sitting, then sat down at her side. ""I've come to see how your work is going. I'll be working with you today.""

""Oh. Good,"" Nora replied. She glanced around the cafeteria, which was empty except for a few early risers and the occasional worker.

""Are you done?"" asked Dr. Jones.

Nora nodded. She wiped her mouth on a napkin and set the tray aside. Then she stood up. ""Yeah. Thanks.""

Dr. Jones rose from his chair, too. He held out his hand again. Nora took it this time and let him help her up.

190,0.4,0.5,1.0,87.0,5,45.0,"The corridor outside her room was dark, but Nora could see faint outlines of her surroundings in the dimness. She walked briskly past the dormitories, passing other colonists heading in different directions. Most of them were already awake.

The hallways were narrow, and Nora was forced to walk single file. The colony's layout seemed to be based on efficiency over aesthetics. But the halls were still wide enough for two people to walk side by side, so Nora had no trouble keeping up with the pace of the others.

After a few minutes, she reached the central concourse where the main corridors intersected. A handful of colonists were gathered there, talking quietly among themselves. They looked tired, but they didn't seem too concerned about it. Nora paused to catch her breath as she passed the group.

""Hey,"" one of the men said. ""You're Nora, right? We've been waiting for you.""

Nora nodded. ""I'm here now.""

""Good. I'll need your help with something. Come with me."" He turned and started down the corridor.

She followed him in silence, trying not to think about what he'd said. Her gut twisted into knots at the thought of going underground again.

They walked through a series of turns and descended several levels until they reached a large metal door. The man punched a code into the keypad beside it, then opened the door with his palm. A blast of stale air rushed out, smelling like dust and rust.

The man led her inside. Nora gasped when she saw the room's interior.

It was a huge, open space with high ceilings and walls of rough concrete dotted with pipes and conduits. The floor was covered in black rubber tiles that reflected the dim light from the ceiling panels. In the center of the room, a massive machine dominated the space. It was an industrial behemoth, taller than Nora by half a meter, and it looked like a giant steel caterpillar.

""What is this thing?"" Nora asked.

""This is our power plant,"" the man replied. ""We're running on backup generators, but we need more power.""

Nora stared at the machine. She had seen similar devices before, but never one so big. The power plant was a fusion reactor. Its primary purpose was to provide energy for the colony, but it also served as a vital part of the colony's defense system.

The power plant housed a large fusion reactor capable of producing enough electricity to run the entire colony. But the reactors were old and inefficient. They needed constant maintenance and repairs, which meant the colonists could only rely on them for short periods of time.

""How long do you need the power plant up and running?"" Nora asked.

""As soon as possible,"" the man replied. ""The drones are getting bolder. We've lost two people in the last month.""

Nora winced at the news. The Colony's power plant was a critical piece of equipment, and she knew how important it was to keep it working.

""I'll get right on it,"" Nora said.

""Thank you. I appreciate your help.""

Nora nodded, then turned toward the door.

191,0.4,0.5,1.0,73.0,6,45.0,"The hallway outside was dimly lit by overhead lights, but she could see well enough to navigate without tripping over anything. The hallways were narrow, cramped, and cluttered with boxes and bags of supplies. At the end of each hall was a communal bathroom where she could wash up.

She walked through the halls, past the dormitories, to the cafeteria. It was the largest room in the colony, filled with tables and chairs, serving dishes, and benches. A long counter lined one wall, offering food options from various stations.

Nora chose two eggs and bacon, a bowl of fruit, and a cup of coffee. She sat at the counter and waited for her order to be served.

The cafeteria was busy, with colonists coming in from their shifts and eating breakfast while they gathered the day's work schedules. Nora glanced around the room, noting the faces of the workers. They were tired and worn down, but also alert and bright eyed as they chatted among themselves.

At the far end of the room, a group of people stood near a large table, talking excitedly. She recognized them from her shift. One man was tall and thin with dark hair, wearing a lab coat. Another was short and stocky, with a bald head and thick glasses. The third was a woman who looked to be in her late twenties with curly brown hair.

The three scientists were talking about something. As she watched, the other colonists drifted away from the table and began to file out of the cafeteria.

Nora finished her meal and carried it back to her quarters before heading off to the command center. She passed through several hallways and rooms until she reached the security checkpoint. A guard in a hard suit with an assault rifle was stationed there, watching over the entrance to the main control room. He nodded at her as she approached.

She stepped into the security booth and waited for the scanner to beep. The guard checked her ID badge, then waved her forward.

The door slid open and Nora stepped inside. The air conditioning was cold, but the room was otherwise empty except for a few consoles. Director Chen sat behind one of them, her face set and stern.

""Good morning, Commander,"" she said without looking up from her workstation. ""You're late.""

""I'm sorry, Director,"" Nora replied. ""I overslept.""

Director Rowena Chen rose from her chair, a look of annoyance on her face. She was tall and lean with long black hair pulled back in a tight bun. She wore a crisp white shirt under a dark grey jacket. Her eyes were sharp and penetrating, but her mouth had an almost tender smile.

""Do you have any idea what's happened?"" she asked.

Nora shook her head. ""No, ma'am. I just got here.""

""And you didn't see anyone else when you came in?

192,0.4,0.5,1.0,87.0,3,43.0,"The corridors were empty. The colonists slept late, and the lights remained dimmed. Nora walked briskly to the cafeteria, where she found a long line snaking through the narrow room. She joined it, hoping for something hot to eat.

The cafeteria was full of people, mostly women, but a few men too. They sat at tables, huddled over bowls of food, or stood in groups talking quietly. Nora scanned the crowd until she spotted Sully near one end of the room.

Sully was a tall woman with dark hair, olive skin, and large brown eyes. She wore a white lab coat over her work clothes, and a small backpack hung from one shoulder. Nora waved to get Sully's attention.

""Hey, Sully!"" Nora called. ""I'm heading out soon.""

Sully looked up, startled. She smiled when she saw Nora. ""Morning, Nora! I didn't think you'd be here so early,"" she said.

Nora shrugged. ""My shift starts in half an hour. I figured I might as well grab breakfast.""

She took a seat at the table next to Sully. The two women shared a bowl of porridge and drank cups of steaming coffee. Nora ate quickly, not wanting to wait any longer than necessary.

""How are things going?"" asked Nora.

Sully nodded toward the other end of the room. ""We're still working on the power plant, but it'll be ready in a day or two. We've got a lot of drones running around, too. They're supposed to keep us safe while we work.""

""Drones? What kind of drones?""

Sully laughed. ""You haven't seen them yet. The Company's been developing new technology for years, and they finally perfected something. These little guys can walk through walls.""

Nora stared at her friend. ""They look like insects to me. How do they walk through walls?""

Sully shrugged. ""I don't know. It just is what it is.""

Nora shook her head. ""And you're okay with this?""

""It's not my decision. I'm just the one who has to deal with them.""

""What happens if you get too close?""

Sully smirked. ""Nothing good. They'll kill us. But we have these big guns, so there isn't much risk involved. The Company's safety protocols make sure of that.""

Nora sighed. ""I wish I could go home."" She didn't say it aloud, but Sully heard anyway.

Sully nodded sympathetically. ""Me too. I miss my family.""

""Do you think we'll ever see them again?"" asked Nora.

""Maybe,"" said Sully. ""But not until the colony's ready for visitors.""

Nora frowned. ""That's terrible. We should be able to send a message back to Earth.""

Sully shrugged. ""We've tried, but we haven't gotten anything in months. Maybe they're too busy trying to fix their own messes.""

""You don't believe that.""

Sully shook her head. ""No, I don't. The Company's been screwing up for years.""

""How do you know? You only work here.""

Sully looked away from Nora. ""I'm not an engineer, but I can tell when something's wrong. I just want to go home. And I want my family safe.""

Nora nodded. ""I understand.""

The two women ate quietly for a few minutes, then finished their meal. Nora stood up and stretched, feeling the aches of a long night.

193,0.4,0.5,1.0,91.0,4,45.0,"The colony's corridors were dimly lit by recessed lighting in the ceiling. The walls were metallic plates and conduits, and the floors were grated concrete. The colonists walked on either side of the corridors, wearing their uniforms as they went about their business.

Nora passed a small group of people who had gathered at the end of the corridor. They stood around a large piece of machinery, which glowed with a faint blue light in its center.

""Hey!"" Nora called out to them. ""What's going on?""

The group turned to look at her as one person. A man with short brown hair and dark skin. He wore a black uniform with the Company logo emblazoned across the chest.

""It's the power plant,"" he said. ""We've lost the feed from the solar array.""

Nora frowned. ""How can you lose a feed? That's impossible.""

He smiled, but his eyes remained serious. ""Not if we're talking about the same thing. We've got a problem with our fusion reactor. It's overheating.""

""Oh no..."" Nora whispered, her voice trembling. She took a step back and rubbed her hands together nervously. ""I'm not sure I know how to fix it.""

The man nodded, then looked at the other colonists. ""Anybody else have an idea?""

A woman stepped forward. Her long blonde hair was pulled into a bun, and she wore a white lab coat over her uniform. ""I'm Dr. Blaine. I'll take care of it.""

""You need to get down there now,"" the man told Nora. ""This is your area of expertise. You're the best engineer in this colony. Get to work on it.""

Nora swallowed hard. ""Yes sir.""

The group dispersed with a wave. The doctor led the way toward the power plant. Nora hesitated for a moment, then followed.

She found the doctor and two technicians working at a console inside the large room. A thick cable ran from the fusion reactor to the console. They were trying to isolate the problem, but they had yet to identify what was causing it.

Dr. Blaine turned around when Nora entered. ""Good morning, Nora."" She smiled warmly and waved a hand at the console. ""We've got some trouble here. Could you help us out?""

Nora blinked, confused. ""Help you with what?""

""The power plant,"" the doctor said. ""It's overheating.""

""Oh."" Nora looked around. ""Where are my tools? And my suit?""

""Your tools and equipment are in the garage,"" Dr. Blaine explained. ""You'll need to get them. We don't have time to wait for you.""

""Right..."" Nora glanced at the doctor, then back at the console. ""I'll be right there.""

She hurried off, leaving the technicians and Dr. Blaine behind. She found her way to the garage, which was attached to the power plant. The door opened automatically when she approached, revealing a dimly lit room filled with rows of shelves and cabinets.

Nora stepped inside and immediately felt claustrophobic. She forced herself to take a deep breath.

The garage was a small space, but it was packed full of heavy machinery. Power loaders and tool racks lined the walls. There were also several large pieces of equipment on wheels.

Nora walked along the rows, looking for the tools she needed.

194,0.4,0.5,1.0,83.0,2,44.0,"The corridor outside her dormitory was empty, but she could hear voices coming from the communal kitchen at the end of the hall. A quick glance around showed Nora that everyone else was still asleep.

She grabbed a handful of fruit and cookies from the food dispenser, then turned to head back to her room when she heard footsteps behind her. The sound made her jump. She spun about to see the dark figure of a man in a long coat standing right behind her.

He smiled, revealing sharp white teeth. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Who are you?"" she demanded.

""I'm your new supervisor,"" he said with a pleasant smile. He held out his hand. ""My name is Ken. I'll be working with you today.""

Nora stared at him blankly for a moment, then her expression hardened. She took a step forward and jabbed a finger into his chest. ""Don't touch me!""

Ken's smile faded. ""What? Nora, what's the matter?""

""You don't know who I am! You don't know anything about me!""

The man raised an eyebrow. ""I know everything there is to know about you. And I can assure you that I've been briefed on your situation. I'll do my best to help, but you have to trust me. We need each other if we're going to make it through this.""

Nora glared at him. ""Why should I trust you?""

""Because you have no choice,"" he said simply. ""We're both trapped here together. It's only a matter of time before our equipment fails, and then the aliens will attack. They'll kill us all unless we cooperate.""

Nora felt her heart pound in her ears. ""Cooperate how?"" she demanded. ""How are you supposed to get us out of this?""

Ken's smile returned. ""I'm not. But I can give you a way to escape. If you'll let me.""

""What is it?"" Nora asked, her voice wavering.

""It's called the 'Aliens' Gate,'and it leads directly to an underground hive where the aliens live. I know how to use it. I can take you there, and then you'll be safe from them.""

Nora stared at him for a long moment, but he didn't move or speak. She looked around, trying to find some sign that he was lying. Her gaze fell on the food dispenser near Ken's feet. There were two more cookies left.

She reached out and grabbed one of the remaining treats, then stuffed it into her mouth.

Ken watched her with a smile. ""Are you sure you want to do that? It won't hurt, but it's going to make me very angry.""

Nora chewed and swallowed. ""What do you mean?"" she asked through a mouthful of cookie.

""You're eating my breakfast,"" he said.

Nora glared at him again. ""I'm hungry.""

Ken shrugged. ""Fine. You can have mine."" He held out his hand, but Nora ignored it.

""How come you get to eat?"" she asked. ""Why don't I get something?""

He laughed.

195,0.4,0.5,1.0,84.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit, but the pale light from the star overhead gave enough illumination to see by. The walls were painted a dull gray, giving the place a utilitarian feel.

Nora passed rows of doors on both sides of the hall, each one marked with a name. She stopped at her own door to check the time. 7: 45 AM. Good. Plenty of time to get the power loaders running and ready for work.

She turned the handle and pushed the door open. Nora paused in surprise. Her room looked different.

The bed was gone, replaced with an unfamiliar, large, comfortable looking chair. A small table stood next to the chair, topped with a bowl of fruit.

A new wall panel displayed a holographic map of the colony's layout. Nora frowned. She'd never seen this before.

Nora walked over and tapped the screen. It came to life, showing a 3D image of the colony. The main concourse was highlighted, indicating the path Nora would take to get to her assigned work site.

The map also showed a blinking red dot on the other side of the colony. She frowned again. That wasn't possible. The entire colony was isolated. There were no ships coming in or going out.

Nora touched the map and zoomed it in until the blinking dot became a tiny circle. She stared at the glowing point.

""What is this?""

It was a ship, hovering just outside of the atmosphere. An ominous black ship with an angular shape and a sleek profile.

Nora drew back in shock. She had never seen anything like it before. The ship was massive, easily three times the size of the largest freighter.

The ship hovered in the air, its hull perfectly smooth. Its nose pointed directly at the colony. Nora watched the ship for several moments, wondering if it would fire on her. But the ship didn't move. It simply hung there, waiting.

Nora stepped closer to the map and studied the ship more closely. The ship's name was displayed below the image.

The Black Ship.

Nora shivered. She knew what this meant.

She turned away from the screen, grabbing her jacket and pulling it on. The sound of footsteps behind her made Nora spin around in alarm. She expected to see one of the colony's security guards.

Instead, a man stood next to the door. He wore a tattered brown coat over a plain white shirt and dark pants. His face was gaunt with hollows under his eyes, and he had a scraggly beard.

""Hello,"" the man said in a gravelly voice. ""I'm looking for Nora Decker.""

Nora stared at him blankly. She'd never seen this man before in her life.

The stranger smiled, revealing a set of crooked teeth. ""You're Nora Decker, right? I need your help.""

Nora blinked. Her mind was still foggy with sleep. What did this guy want with her?

The man stepped forward, extending his hand. ""My name is Peter.""

Nora hesitated for a moment before taking the man's hand in hers. His skin was cold and clammy. She pulled her hand back quickly and wiped it on her jacket.

196,0.4,0.5,1.0,87.0,5,46.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by a few flickering lights. The walls were covered in a rough-textured material, but the floors and ceilings were smooth and polished. Nora glanced up at the ceiling as she walked past the rows of doors lining each side of the hall.

The colony's power plant was directly below her, its fusion reactor humming softly. She could hear it through the thick concrete, even over the low rumble of the wind rattling the outer walls.

Nora passed several colonists on their way to work. They wore the same clothes they'd worn yesterday, with the same tired expressions. Nora wondered if any of them had slept last night.

She entered the mess hall, which was filled with a dozen people eating breakfast. The smell of food made her stomach growl, but she resisted the urge to wolf down the meal. This wasn't the time for a snack. She took her place at one of the long tables and sat across from a woman who was already finishing off her bowl of cereal.

""Good morning,"" Nora said.

The woman nodded absently, not looking up. Her hair was a mop of brown curls, and a dark bruise circled her left eye.

""You okay?"" Nora asked.

The woman stared at her bowl of cereal. ""I'm fine.""

Nora didn't know what else to say, so she turned back to her own breakfast. The eggs were cold, the bacon was hard and dry, and the toast tasted like cardboard. Nora had to force herself to eat.

By the time Nora finished her meal, most of the colonists were gone. She walked outside into the crisp morning air, where the ground was still dewy with moisture from the night's rain. The sky overhead was clear, but the wind carried a chill that made her shiver inside her jacket.

Nora headed toward the agricultural section. It took her past a row of large greenhouses, each one covered in a layer of dust and dirt. She stopped to wipe her hands on her pants before entering the building.

Inside was an enormous room filled with rows of hydroponic gardens. The plants grew in huge pots, which were lined up along metal shelves. Nora could see the tops of their leaves and stems poking out through gaps between the shelves. The lighting was dim, but it wasn't completely dark. A few lights illuminated the area, casting a faint glow over everything.

Nora walked down the aisle, watching the plants grow. They were all different sizes, and some were even shaped differently than the ones she'd seen growing in the greenhouse back home. But they all looked healthy. The soil was rich and moist, and Nora knew that the nutrients would be absorbed directly into the plant roots. The crops constantly recycled water and fertilizer, so there was no need for watering or feeding.

She reached the end of the aisle and turned to head back outside. As she did, a drone flew overhead, buzzing around the roof of the greenhouse. It glowed with a dull light that cast shadows across its body and wings.

Nora froze in place, staring at the drone.

197,0.4,0.5,1.0,73.0,6,46.0,"The colony's dormitories were empty at this early hour, but a few colonists sat around the dining hall tables, eating their breakfasts. A handful of men and women in work clothes stood by the windows, staring out at the landscape beyond the walls.

The colony was still surrounded by the dark night sky, but a faint glow from the horizon gave it just enough illumination to see by. The air was cold and crisp, the wind blowing in off the plains. Nora took deep breaths of the fresh morning air as she walked past the dining hall to the communal showers.

She could hear the low hum of the water pumps, the hiss of steam, and the gurgle of running water. Nora smiled in anticipation of the hot shower.

She stepped inside one of the large rooms filled with rows of cubicles, each containing a showerhead. The room was dimly lit and smelled of soap and disinfectant. Warm water flowed down the length of the showerheads and dripped onto the floor, where it pooled into a small puddle. Nora stepped up to the first row of showerheads and turned on the warm flow of water.

Nora sighed as the hot spray washed over her body, relaxing the tension in her muscles. She scrubbed herself clean and then used the soap to wash the grime from her hair. Her long black tresses were matted and tangled, but she rinsed them out thoroughly before letting them dry in the air.

Nora looked at herself in a mirror hanging above the sinks as she dried off. The reflection showed an attractive young woman with dark brown skin, green eyes, and wavy black hair. She was leaner than most of the colonists, but not too thin. In fact, Nora had been blessed with good genes and genetics that gave her a natural athletic build.

She turned away from the mirror to dress for work. As usual, she wore utility pants, a fitted shirt, and a jacket over top. The clothes were practical and durable, but they weren't exactly fashionable. They fit well enough, though. Nora wasn't picky about how people dressed around her.

The colony's infirmary was located in the same building as the dormitories, and Nora passed through a set of doors to reach it. She walked down a short corridor until she reached another set of doors. This time, the door opened into a large room filled with medical equipment.

Nora smiled. The infirmary was a modern facility with state-of-the-art technology and a staff of highly trained doctors and nurses. It also served as the colony's hospital, and its facilities were open to anyone who needed treatment.

Nora stepped inside and looked around. The infirmary was clean and bright, the walls painted white and the lighting subdued. A few patients lay on beds in the center of the room, some sleeping while others mumbled quietly to themselves.

",-0.07193877551020378,-0.20795918367346855,0.01612244897959192
198,0.4,0.6,1.0,67.0,4,46.0,"Ahead, the dormitory hallways were empty. The colonists had already left for their morning duties. Nora walked briskly to the mess hall where a few people lingered over breakfast. She took her place at one of the tables, and waited for someone to notice her.

No one did. Nora sighed in frustration.

She was still waiting when the door opened again. A young woman entered the room, dressed in a dark blue uniform. Her hair was long, black, and straight. She wore glasses that made her eyes look large. Her face was pale and pretty.

Nora recognized the newcomer immediately. She was the colony's doctor.

""Good morning, Dr. Decker,"" said the new arrival cheerily, as if they had just met. ""I'm Dr. Chen.""

""Morning."" Nora nodded back.

Dr. Chen sat down across from her. ""You're on the medical staff?""

Nora shrugged. ""Not really, but I work with them. I do some research and help run experiments.""

""Ah, so you're an engineer too?""

""That's right. You know, a lot of people think we engineers are the ones who make things work. But it's actually the scientists and researchers who figure out how to fix stuff. My job is mostly administrative, for the most part.""

""Well, I'm glad to have you on my team. We could use a good mechanic around here."" Dr. Chen smiled warmly.

Nora returned the smile, surprised by the other woman's friendly attitude. ""Thanks. I appreciate that.""

""So, what brings you up this early? Did you get your first shift yet?""

""No, not yet."" Nora shook her head. ""I still need to finish a few things before I start.""

""Oh."" Dr. Chen looked disappointed. ""We'll be shorthanded until then. Do you want me to give you the day off?""

Nora hesitated for a moment. ""Um, no, I'll just go ahead and work through it.""

Dr. Chen nodded her understanding. ""I understand. Well, see you at lunchtime."" She stood up from the table.

""See ya."" Nora watched the doctor walk away and sighed again.

The colonists were already hard at work when Nora arrived at the engineering bay. The bright lights and loud noises of the busy facility made it look like an operating room. Nora walked past the makeshift labs where scientists worked on various projects. Some people hurried about their tasks, while others lounged around talking or reading.

She rounded a corner to find the main lab. It was a large open space with rows of desks and computer workstations. At one end, a pair of technicians sat at a bank of monitors. They wore white coats over blue shirts and pants.

Nora approached the two men. ""Morning.""

""Good morning,"" said the taller man. He was thin, dark haired, and had a strong jawline.

",-0.07193877551020378,-0.10795918367346857,0.01612244897959192
199,0.4,0.6,1.0,91.0,4,50.0,"Nora's boots clomped as she walked across the cold, hard ground to the communal kitchen. The place smelled like bacon and eggs. She paused outside the door to listen for activity inside.

The colony was quiet. No one else seemed up yet. But it wasn't unusual for colonists to sleep in. They were tired and exhausted from working all night long. At least they got to do that every day.

She opened the door and entered the dimly lit room. A few people occupied the tables, eating. They glanced at her as she passed.

Nora made her way to a table where four men sat. She slid into an empty seat next to the window, facing them.

""Morning,"" she said. ""Good morning.""

They nodded back in response. One of the men had a beard and wore a dirty bandana around his head. He was the oldest man in the room, probably in his late thirties. His eyes were red rimmed and bloodshot from lack of sleep.

The other three men were young; two men and a woman. All three looked tired, but their expressions betrayed no fear. Their faces were smudged with dirt and sweat.

Nora smiled at them, trying to put her best foot forward. She didn't know any of these people well enough to be comfortable making small talk.

The older man spoke first. ""You're the engineer?""

""Yes,"" Nora replied.

He nodded. ""I'm the chief mechanic. I'll take you to the armory.""

Nora followed him out of the room and down the hall. The door closed behind them.

The corridor was dimly lit, but the old man's eyes were sharp. He moved confidently through the hallways, and Nora felt more secure following him.

They walked past a few doors to a set of stairs leading downward. The man led her to the bottom floor. A blast door sealed the stairwell off from the rest of the colony.

""That's the armory,"" he said. ""We've got an automated defense system. It'll keep anyone out who isn't authorized.""

Nora nodded. She spotted a keypad next to the door.

""What do we need to get in here?""

The old man pulled a card out of his pocket and handed it to her. ""Just press this button and say my name when the door opens. I'll show you where everything is inside.""

Nora nodded again, took the card, and pressed the button. The door slid open. She stepped into the armory.

The room was huge and filled with weapons. Nora stood at the center of the room, staring around in awe. There were racks upon racks of guns and rifles, pistols and knives, even grenades.

""This way,"" the old man said. He pointed to a row of cabinets along one wall. ""There's a keycard for each cabinet. You can't use anything without the right card.""

Nora followed him over to the first cabinet. The old man inserted his card into the slot and turned it, opening the cabinet. Nora peered inside.

She saw rows of ammunition boxes, spare parts, and tools. A pistol rested on a shelf above her head.

""Anything else you need?"" the old man asked.

",-0.07193877551020378,-0.10795918367346857,0.01612244897959192
200,0.4,0.6,1.0,87.0,3,48.0,"The corridor outside her room was empty except for a few colonists heading to work or coming back from their shifts. A few people in the hallways were already up, but most of them slept late. The colony's population was small enough that everyone knew everyone else.

Nora walked briskly toward the dining area, where she could grab a quick meal before starting her day. As she passed the cafeteria, she saw that the door was open and someone had left the lights on inside. That meant there was food left. She paused at the threshold to peek inside.

A figure stood near the counter, looking around with a confused expression. Nora recognized him immediately. It was the man who'd been wandering around the colony earlier, the one who'd seemed so lost. He looked like he hadn't eaten in days. His clothes were rumpled and dirty, his face haggard.

Nora stepped into the cafeteria and approached the counter cautiously. ""Hey,"" she said softly. ""Are you okay?""

He turned to look at her, blinking slowly as if waking from a deep sleep. Nora gestured to the table behind him. ""Sit down. I'll get you some breakfast.""

""I don't... I'm not hungry,"" he muttered.

Nora frowned. ""You've got to eat something. It's going to be a long day."" She paused, thinking about what she should do next.

As she watched, the man dropped into a chair with a thud. Then his head lolled forward and he slumped in the seat. Nora rushed over, grabbed him under the arms, and pulled him upright. The man was limp and heavy, but Nora managed to drag him out of the cafeteria without losing her balance.

She took him back to his room, where he collapsed on the bed. Nora went back for a blanket and covered him up. She sat beside him and waited until he woke again.

The man blinked a few times, then looked around with confusion. ""What happened? Where am I?""

Nora shook her head. ""Don't worry about it right now. You need to get some food into you.""

He nodded slowly. ""Yeah, I guess so. What time is it?""

Nora glanced at the clock on the wall. ""It's just after six in the morning.""

""What day is today?""

She checked the calendar. ""Wednesday, July 23rd.""

He stared at her blankly. ""July... what month is this?""

Nora frowned. ""You're not from here, are you?""

The man looked confused. ""No. I'm from New York City. How long have I been asleep?""

""About two weeks.""

His eyes widened. ""Two weeks? That's impossible!"" He sat up abruptly. ""I can't be here! This isn't possible!""

Nora frowned. ""Calm down. Take a deep breath. You've got to get some rest. I'll see if I can find someone who knows what's going on. But first, you need to eat something.""

The man rubbed his face with both hands. ""What do you mean? I'm not hungry.""

Nora sighed. ""Look, I know you don't feel like eating right now. Just take it easy for a while. You'll be okay.""

201,0.4,0.6,1.0,73.0,5,46.0,"The halls were quiet as Nora made her way to the communal dining hall. The corridors were dimly lit, but she could make out the outlines of people moving about in the shadows. A few colonists sat at tables by the windows, sipping from steaming mugs while they read. Others stood along the walls, chatting quietly.

Nora walked past them, careful not to bump anyone, and entered a large room filled with long tables. At one end was the serving counter where a woman dressed in a uniform of white blouse and dark slacks waited behind the glass partition. Nora approached the counter.

""Good morning,"" the woman said, smiling as she recognized Nora. ""Are you ready for your first day?""

Nora nodded. ""Yes.""

The woman handed Nora a cup of coffee and pointed to the other side of the room. ""You'll find the cafeteria over there. Have fun!""

Nora smiled wanly and thanked her. She turned around and walked toward the far wall, passing several colonists who waved to her. They were mostly young men and women, but some older ones as well. Nora found herself wondering what their lives must be like. They seemed so normal, yet they lived in such an unusual place.

She was just about to pass a table where two women sat reading when she heard someone call out to her. Startled, Nora looked up to see a man approaching with a tray of food. He wore a dark suit and tie, and his hair was neatly trimmed.

""Good morning,"" he said.

Nora nodded politely.

""I'm Mr. Harris,"" the man said. ""Head of the colony's administrative staff. I wanted to welcome you personally.""

Nora couldn't help but smile at him. ""Thank you, sir.""

Mr. Harris gestured to the empty seat across from Nora. ""Please. Sit down. It's good to meet you. We're eager to get started on your training. You'll find Presley's Promise very different than the Company colonies, but we hope it will be a good fit for you.""

Nora nodded again. She sat down and took a sip of her coffee while Mr. Harris pulled out a chair opposite her.

""Now, Nora,"" he began. ""Let me tell you a little bit about our colony. Our population is small, only a few hundred people. Most of them are scientists and engineers. The rest are trained in various trades and professions to support their work. We have no military presence, so security is not a concern here. Our main goal is to explore the planet's surface and its resources.""

""What kind of resources?"" Nora asked.

Harris smiled. ""You'll see soon enough. But first, let me explain how things work around here. The Company provides us with the best technology available to keep us safe, but we must also make do with what we can manage ourselves.""

Nora nodded. She'd heard this before. ""The Company provides everything, right?""

""Everything except the colonists themselves,"" Mr. Harris said.

202,0.4,0.6,1.0,95.0,4,45.0,"The halls were dimly lit by emergency lights set at intervals along the walls. The air smelled stale and close, and Nora's breath puffed out in clouds. She hurried through the corridors, trying not to think about how much longer she'd be awake.

The dormitories were crowded with colonists huddled around tables for meals. They wore the same utilitarian clothing, but their faces were tired, worn, and grimy from the long hours spent working outside.

Nora found a table near the back of the room where she could sit alone. She took a seat at the end, facing the wall. A few other colonists sat nearby, murmuring quietly to each other over mugs of steaming coffee or tea.

She ate quickly, then washed down her meal with a mug of water. It was cold and tasted faintly metallic. She felt the familiar itch in her throat as she swallowed the bitter liquid.

Nora left the dining hall and walked toward the communal showers. At the end of the hall, she passed through the door into a wide open area filled with benches and lockers. She stepped under the hot spray and let it wash away the grit of the day, washing her hair and body.

Afterward, Nora dried off with towels and dressed in fresh clothes before returning to the dormitory. She paused at the entrance to check on the colonists who were still awake. Most were already asleep, but a few were sitting up, staring blankly ahead.

Nora checked her watch. She had a couple of hours until she needed to report for work. That would give her a chance to catch some sleep if she hurried.

Nora returned to her quarters, opened the door, and stepped inside. The lights flickered once, twice, then came back on. Nora blinked at the sudden brightness and looked around. Everything seemed normal.

She closed the door behind her. She heard faint sounds coming from somewhere else in the dormitory, but nothing was out of place. There were no signs of the colony's AI running amok.

Nora walked down the hall and stopped in front of her door. She reached for the handle, but hesitated when she saw it wasn't locked.

The door swung open. Nora stepped into her room and froze.

Her room was empty. Her bed was unmade, the sheets rumpled. A towel lay on the floor near the bathroom. She didn't remember leaving it there.

Nora backed away from her room, trying not to panic. It was just a malfunction. She'd be fine.

She walked back down the corridor toward the communal showers. As she passed the dormitory, she noticed something odd. The colonists were gone. All of them. Nora stopped in her tracks and stared at the empty benches.

She turned slowly around. The colonists weren't in their rooms. They weren't in the dining hall. She couldn't see any of them anywhere.

Nora ran back to her quarters. She opened the door, then slammed it shut again with a gasp.

The door was locked.

Nora pounded on the door. ""Hello! Anyone here?"" She shouted at the top of her lungs.

The door shook under the force of her blows. Nora fell silent and listened. She could hear nothing but the sound of her own breathing echoing off the walls.

She tried the handle. The door was locked tight. She turned and looked around the room, frantic.

203,0.4,0.6,1.0,87.0,4,50.0,"The halls were dimly lit by flickering emergency lights at intervals along the walls, but Nora could still make out the dark patches where the ceiling panels had been removed. The air was stale from lack of circulation, but it smelled faintly of dust and mold. A few colonists passed her, each wearing a matching uniform with their name tags hanging around necklaces.

Nora followed the sound of voices to the cafeteria. The long room was empty except for a handful of people sitting at one end. As she approached, Nora saw that they were eating breakfast.

The cafeteria was a large open space with rows of tables. Each table was filled with several plates of food and cups of steaming coffee. Nora walked up to the nearest group of people. They looked up in surprise as she stopped beside them.

""Good morning,"" said Nora politely, though her attention was elsewhere. She scanned the room for signs of trouble and found none. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

She introduced herself. The woman nodded, but didn't say anything else. Nora took a seat at the far end of the table next to a man who looked like he was about forty years old. He wore an engineer's jumpsuit and carried a tool belt on his hip. His hair was short, black, and spiky. Nora guessed him to be Irish or something similar.

The woman with the crew cut glanced over at Nora, then looked away again. The other two men were older. One was balding and had a thick beard. The other was older still, with dark skin and a long, droopy mustache.

They all stared at Nora in silence, but she felt no hostility. There wasn't much to do here. They were just waiting for their shifts to start so they could go back to work.

""You're new,"" said the bearded man. ""What are you doing here?""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm the best mechanic in the colony. I was assigned to this post.""

""Huh,"" grunted the balding man. ""We've been stuck with a bunch of greenhorns for the past few weeks. We should have sent someone else out there. That's a rough planet to get a foothold on, and they don't know what they're doing.""

The others nodded. Nora smiled slightly at the man who'd spoken first. She knew he was right. The colonists had been stuck with inexperienced engineers for too long. They needed some experienced hands to help them fix things. But it didn't matter now. She was already here, and she would do her job.

She took a sip of coffee. It tasted like dirt.

The bearded man looked at Nora. ""How old are you, kid?""

""Twenty-two,"" she said.

He snorted. ""That's young for an engineer. You're going to be a liability if you can't think your way out of a paper bag.""

Nora shrugged again. ""I'll learn.""

His eyes narrowed. ""You'll have to. And fast. We've got a lot of work ahead of us, so we need to get started."" He turned away from her and looked around the room.

She turned a corner and found the hall filled with people. They wore bright clothes in various shades of blue, green, yellow, and red. Some wore the same color scheme as Nora, while others had more varied combinations of colors. A few wore outfits that looked like military uniforms.

The colonists moved about the corridors with purpose. Their footsteps echoed along the metallic flooring, echoing back from the walls.

Nora stopped short. She recognized the woman leading them.

Valentina Kern. Commander of Presley's Promise.

Nora gulped. Valentina was a tough, capable leader who knew how to handle herself in any situation. But at the moment, she wasn't wearing her uniform. Instead, Valentina wore a long, gray coat over a black tank top and baggy cargo pants. Her hair was tied up into a ponytail that hung down her back.

And she carried a gun.

A large, heavy revolver with an extended barrel and a bulky grip.

Nora felt a chill run through her body. She had seen guns before, but never one like this. Valentina's weapon was the size of a cannon, and it looked like something out of a movie set.

She turned away from the sight, trying not to stare. Nora didn't want to look like a coward in front of the other colonists.

But she couldn't help herself. The gun was so big, so intimidating, that it made her feel small. It was a weapon that could kill her in seconds if someone wanted to use it on her.

Nora swallowed hard. She had never been scared of anything before, but now she was afraid for her life.

""Oh, no,"" she whispered. ""No.""

Valentina stopped beside a door and turned to face the crowd. Her voice was loud enough that everyone heard her, even though she spoke softly.

""This is our new Command Center. We're going to start there. I'll give you a tour around the rest of the colony later. For now, we need to get started.""

The colonists murmured among themselves. A few people nodded in agreement, but most seemed confused or nervous.

Nora felt the same way. She glanced at Valentina again. The commander's eyes were cold and determined.

Nora looked away from her.

Valentina led them down the corridor, past the command center and into a wide, open space. The colonists followed behind her in silence.

Nora caught glimpses of the room through gaps between other colonists. It was large, with a vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns. There were tables littered across its floor and walls. Some of the tables held equipment, while others had chairs and stools.

A long counter stretched along one side of the room. Behind it stood a tall man in uniform who seemed to be in charge. His dark hair was cut short and his face looked gaunt. He wore a black suit jacket over a white shirt and tie, but no pants.

Nora's gaze lingered on him for a moment before she realized that he wasn't the only person standing there.

205,0.4,0.6,1.0,78.0,3,45.0,"She paused at the end of the hall to check the time. The sun wasn't up yet, but she could see through the window that the sky was a brilliant blue. A few wisps of fog drifted in from the sea beyond.

Nora rapped on the door to Sully's office, then opened it. He sat behind his desk, staring out the window. His dark hair was still damp, and he wore only a neatly pressed uniform shirt and slacks.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm ready.""

Sully turned to look at her. ""You're early. I didn't expect you for another hour.""

Nora shrugged, not bothering to hide the irritation in her voice. ""It took me longer than expected to get my shower started this morning. My fingers are cold.""

He nodded. ""Your fingers will be cold if we don't hurry.""

""I know. But I need a break from the work anyway. I'll eat later.""

Sully stood and gestured toward the door. ""Let's go. We have a lot to do today.""

Nora followed him out of her quarters and down the hall. They passed a few colonists in various states of dress, but no one else was awake yet.

The colony's main dining room was at the end of the corridor. It had a long table with benches along both sides. The tables were covered in white cloths, and a large chandelier hung overhead.

A handful of colonists sat at the tables. Some ate breakfast while others read or worked on their computers.

Nora paused outside the dining room, looking around for familiar faces. She spotted a few people she knew from her shift yesterday, but most of them looked like strangers.

""Come on,"" Sully said. ""We'll grab something to eat.""

Nora followed Sully into the dining room and took a seat at an empty table. He pulled out a chair for her.

""I hope you like eggs.""

""I love eggs,"" Nora replied. ""Can I get some toast?""

Sully nodded and walked away.

Nora sat alone, watching the other colonists eat quietly and surreptitiously. A few glanced at her, but none spoke.

She waited until he returned with a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. She took a bite of the egg, which was just right.

""You're not eating much,"" Sully commented. ""Are you sure you don't want anything else?""

Nora shook her head.

He sat down across from her. ""What is it? You look pale.""

""I'm fine.""

Sully frowned. ""You can tell me if something's wrong. I know how hard this job is.""

Nora didn't say anything. She finished off her breakfast, then set the plate aside and leaned back in her chair.

""I'll be honest,"" Sully said. ""I was hoping we could take a break today. Get away from the work for a while.""

Nora looked at him. ""Why?""

""Because I've been thinking about what you told us yesterday. About the aliens. It sounds like they're planning something big.

206,0.4,0.6,1.0,90.0,4,42.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lighting. The colony's power plant hummed in the background, providing a constant low thrumming drone that filled the air. Nora passed through the main concourse where colonists gathered for meals and recreation.

Nora headed to the nearest cafeteria, hoping it hadn't been too long since last night's meal. She found a table and sat down. A young man with thick black hair, dark eyes, and a broad smile greeted her.

""Morning, Nora.""

She smiled back at him. ""Hi, Ryan. Good morning. How are you feeling?""

""I'm good,"" he said. ""How about yourself? You look like someone ran over your dog.""

Nora chuckled. ""That bad, huh? I think I'd be more worried if you looked better than me.""

He laughed. ""You're right. I'm sorry. It's just... this place is weird. We've only been here for a few weeks, but it feels like we've been living in these cramped little rooms forever."" He gestured around the crowded room. ""It's hard not to feel claustrophobic when you can see the stars from every window.""

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, I know what you mean. But it's not so bad once you get used to it."" She paused. ""I wish I could say the same thing about my job, though. The Company keeps sending us out on missions where we have to go into dangerous places and fix things. They don't give us much time for training or preparation.""

Ryan frowned. ""So they send you out unprepared, then?""

""Exactly. And that makes me nervous. I'm a good engineer, but I need more experience. I don't want to screw up again.""

Ryan reached across the table to squeeze her hand. ""Don't worry. You won't. I promise.""

Nora smiled at him, but she wasn't convinced. She knew how fragile life was here. If something went wrong, they were completely vulnerable. Every mistake could cost them their lives.

She glanced around the cafeteria. It seemed like everyone else had already finished eating. A few colonists sat near the windows, sipping coffee or tea while reading books. Most of them looked pale and drawn.

Nora pushed away her own meal with a sigh. ""I should get going."" She stood up from the table, but Ryan held onto her arm.

""You're not hungry?"" he asked.

""Not really,"" she said. ""I'm too tired. I'll grab some breakfast later.""

He nodded, clearly disappointed. ""Okay, well... see you around.""

Nora waved and left the cafeteria, walking down a long corridor toward the central hub. She passed through a series of rooms, each one filled with different kinds of equipment. Some of it was working, but most of it was broken.

She paused outside an engineering bay where several people worked on various pieces of machinery. One man was bent over a table, trying to fix the malfunctioning device. Another woman stood nearby, watching him work.

""Hey there, Nora,"" she said.

",-0.07193877551020378,-0.10795918367346857,0.01612244897959192
207,0.4,0.6,1.0,81.0,4,46.0,"The corridors were empty except for two colonists walking briskly in opposite directions. They wore identical uniforms, but one was a young woman with black hair and green eyes. The other was a man with brown hair and blue eyes. Nora paused to watch them pass, wondering if they knew each other.

She wondered what it would be like to work alongside someone else. She wasn't sure she could handle it. She was too much of a lone wolf. But the idea intrigued her.

The Colony's computer system had been down for days, so Nora couldn't check the roster to see who was working today. She'd have to ask.

As Nora walked, her boots clomped loudly on the metal flooring. The sound echoed through the halls, bouncing off the walls. It made her think of the drones lurking outside, waiting to ambush the humans.

Nora shivered at the thought of being stalked by those creatures. She hoped Eve would keep her safe.

The colony's power plant, which supplied electricity and heat to every part of the complex, was a large, squat structure near the center of the main concourse. Nora entered the building and approached the service bay where maintenance techs worked on the equipment.

The work area was dominated by a row of large, heavy power loaders parked in neat rows. The machines were old but well maintained and looked rugged and reliable. They were the same make and model Nora used for her own job.

The techs were busy with their tasks. One man stood beside one machine, adjusting a cable while another worked nearby. A third tech was perched atop a ladder, repairing the underside of a panel on the wall.

Nora stopped at the foot of the nearest loader and waited patiently for the tech to finish his work. He glanced up from his task, then returned to it.

""Hey,"" Nora said. ""I'm looking for someone.""

The tech lowered his wrench and turned toward her. His eyes widened, but he didn't say anything.

Nora cleared her throat. ""I need to talk to you about the power plant. I'm an engineer, so I can help out with the repairs. Do you know if anyone is working today?""

The tech stared at her blankly. Nora frowned and sighed. She leaned forward, resting both hands on the loader's metal frame.

""Look,"" Nora said. ""It's important. You have to tell me what's going on.""

The tech scowled, but he still didn't speak.

Nora took a deep breath and tried again. ""Please? It'll only take a minute.""

The tech glared at her, then climbed down from his perch and walked away. Nora watched him go, then turned back to the power plant.

She glanced around the room. The other techs were busy with their tasks, oblivious to her conversation with the first. Nora sighed and started walking toward them.

The man on top of the ladder was just finishing his work when Nora approached. He looked up and frowned. ""What do you want?""

""I'm looking for someone,"" Nora said. ""Do you know where I can find Eve?""

He nodded, then climbed down from the ladder. He reached into a toolbox and pulled out a wrench. He handed it to Nora.

208,0.4,0.7,1.0,95.0,3,41.0,"The corridors were empty, but she walked briskly with purpose. The colony's power plant hummed along behind her, its fusion reactor glowing like a beacon in the dark. She passed through the main concourse, where colonists gathered to eat and socialize.

The dining hall was quiet. Nora paused at the door, listening for sounds of life from inside. A few people sat around the tables, talking quietly, but there was no sign of activity.

Nora pushed open the door.

A young woman stood near the serving counter. She wore a blue jumpsuit with a white star on the left breast. Her brown hair hung loose over her shoulders.

""Hello,"" Nora said. ""Is everything okay?""

The girl looked up from the plate of food she was holding. She smiled faintly. ""Yes, I'm fine.""

Nora hesitated. ""You're not hungry? You don't look it.""

""I just ate."" The girl set down her fork and picked up her glass of water.

Nora frowned. ""Are you sick?""

The girl shook her head. ""No. I've been eating regularly, but... I don't know. It's nothing. Just a feeling.""

""That's strange. Are you sure you feel well enough to work?""

The girl nodded. ""I'll be fine. Thank you for asking.""

Nora watched the girl leave the dining hall. She wasn't worried about her, but the girl had seemed so weak. Nora felt a twinge of guilt, remembering how she'd been afraid to ask questions when she first arrived at the colony.

Nora stepped into the kitchen and found a young man standing in front of the ovens. He wore a white chef's hat with the company logo on it.

""Good morning,"" he said, smiling.

Nora returned his greeting. ""Hi. I'm Nora. I start my shift in two hours.""

""I know. That's why I came early."" The young man paused for a moment. ""I wanted to talk with you. I'm the head cook here.""

""Oh, okay.""

""I'm Soren. My father was a chef on Earth, and I learned from him. I've been working here since I was sixteen years old.""

""I see. And what do you want to talk about?""

Soren took off his hat and ran his fingers through his hair, which was dark brown and wavy. ""About your work.""

Nora frowned. ""My work?""

""Yes. You're an engineer, right? What's it like to be one of the Company's engineers?""

Nora didn't know what to say. She'd never been asked such a question before.

""It's a hard job,"" she said. ""We're always busy. But we're also responsible for keeping this whole place running.""

Soren nodded. ""I know. I've seen the reports. It sounds like you have a lot of responsibility.""

Nora shrugged. ""I guess. I just try to keep everyone safe and fed. That's my job.""

""Do you ever worry about being attacked?"" Soren asked.

""Attacked? No, not really. The Company's got the best security in the galaxy."" Nora paused. ""Besides, I think they'd rather people stay alive than be heroes.""

""That's true,"" Soren said. ""But it's still scary, isn't it?""

209,0.4,0.7,1.0,80.0,5,45.0,"The hallways were dimly lit, the lights flickering as they flickered. A few colonists slept in their rooms, but most were already up and about. The colony's power plant hummed loudly, the sound echoing through the halls, and the air smelled faintly of ozone.

At the end of the corridor, Nora found a small cafeteria where she grabbed two bowls of cereal from the serving line. She sat at a table and ate the dry flakes, trying not to think too hard about what was going on outside of Presley's Promise.

The colony had been here for only five years, but the Company that owned it had planned to stay indefinitely. That meant there were no other colonies nearby. No resources beyond the planet itself.

Nora finished her second bowl of cereal, then washed it down with a glass of water. She stood, shoved the empty bowls into a bin, and walked back toward her quarters.

She didn't have much time before she needed to get ready for work.

* * *

The sun was high overhead when Nora arrived at the command center, a large room filled with consoles and screens. The door slid open automatically as she approached, revealing a long, dimly lit hallway lined with doors.

Nora entered the command center and shut the door behind her. It closed silently, leaving her in total darkness. She heard the click of a lock engaging and felt the heavy weight of the door on its hinges.

Nora waited a moment, listening, but the silence remained absolute. The dark interior was silent, too, save for the faint hum of machinery. Nora felt the cold metal walls and floor underfoot, the smooth texture of the surface beneath her fingertips, and the warmth of the air that surrounded her.

She shivered slightly. A draft whispered through the room, carrying the scent of ozone and dust.

Nora's eyes adjusted to the dimness, and she found herself standing at the entrance to a small office. She took a step forward and stopped.

A man sat at the desk in front of her, his face illuminated by the light from the monitor on the desk. He wore a black suit and crisp white shirt, with a thin red tie. His hair was neatly trimmed, and he had pale blue eyes.

He looked up at Nora. ""Good morning,"" he said.

""Um... hi."" Nora tried not to stare. The man's voice was deep and resonant, a pleasant baritone. But something about it made her uneasy. It was too calm for someone who'd just woken up.

The man smiled. ""I'm Mr. Sorensen, your supervisor. I'll be the one you report to today. Please have a seat.""

Nora walked into the room and sat down in one of two chairs facing the desk. She was still wearing her utility pants, jacket, and boots.

Mr. Sorensen leaned back in his chair, folding his hands on top of the desk. ""What do you think so far?""

Nora shrugged. ""It's quiet. And cold.""

""Yes, we're very isolated here. We don't get many visitors. Most of the colonists are engineers or scientists. They work hard to keep things running smoothly.""

210,0.4,0.7,1.0,83.0,3,43.0,"The colony's power plant hummed with activity as she passed through its cavernous halls, but the air was still cold outside. The foggy atmosphere made everything look duller than usual, like a photograph taken in low light.

The main concourse was filled with colonists at various points of their day. Some were working, others lounging, some talking, others staring blankly out the windows. Nora walked past groups of people on her way to the cafeteria to grab something to eat.

She spotted her friend Sam, who waved to her from across the room. Nora nodded back, then turned to walk toward the cafeteria.

Sam was a tall man with dark hair, tanned skin, and strong features. He wore a loose, long sleeved shirt that hung off one shoulder, exposing the muscles of his arms. His face looked tired and worn, but he smiled broadly when Nora approached him.

""Hey there,"" he said, giving her a friendly slap on the arm. ""You're up early.""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm always up early.""

""Yeah, I guess you are. Hey, we should get together for lunch sometime. You want to go out?""

Nora grinned. ""Sure! Where do you want to go? We could hit a bar or—""

""No, I was thinking more about going out for food. Or maybe just grabbing something quick at home. What do you think?""

Nora hesitated. She didn't have much of an appetite these days, but she wasn't sure if it would be better to eat alone or invite Sam along.

""Hm... let's see what my mom says,"" Nora mused.

""Your mom?""

""My mom runs this place. She knows everything that goes on here.""

Sam frowned. ""That sounds like a bad idea.""

""Why? It'll give us something to talk about while we eat.""

""Maybe, but..."" Sam trailed off. ""Look, I know you're not feeling well, and it might seem strange for me to ask, but you don't really look too good yourself.""

""I'm fine,"" Nora insisted. ""Just a little tired is all.""

But she knew she was lying. Her eyes were bloodshot, her skin pale, and her hair looked dull.

""You sure?"" Sam asked again. ""Because I can take you to the infirmary if you want.""

Nora shook her head. ""It's okay. Really, it's nothing serious.""

Sam nodded. ""Okay then. We'll go out for food. You hungry?""

""Yeah,"" Nora said. ""I could use a quick meal. I'll meet you at your quarters.""

Sam laughed. ""Fine. See ya later."" He waved, then turned and walked away.

Nora watched him leave, then sighed. She was always so busy with work that she rarely got to see anyone else. It felt like they were living in a bubble here, isolated from the rest of humanity.

She headed back toward the cafeteria, but when she reached it she hesitated. The mess hall was crowded. Nora had been planning on grabbing something light and easy, but she couldn't help feeling nervous about eating alone.

211,0.4,0.7,1.0,87.0,5,47.0,"The dormitory hallways were dimly lit by glowing strips along the ceiling. The corridor outside Nora's door was lined with doors leading to each of the colonists' rooms. As she walked past, she noticed a few people moving about their business in the gloom.

She stopped at the end of the hallway where the communal showers were located. A large rectangular opening allowed for the flow of water from the main source to the individual stalls, which were separated by opaque glass partitions.

Nora looked around the room. She saw a row of three rows of showerheads on the wall above the sinks. Each one was equipped with a flexible hose that led to a storage tank.

The system was designed so that the colonists could use the same water for multiple purposes, but Nora thought it would be best to conserve as much of the precious liquid as possible. She turned off her own showerhead and started up the next one in line.

As the warm water poured over her head, Nora sighed. Her hair felt like it had been washed too many times. Rubbing her scalp, she tried to remember if she had a conditioner or some other treatment.

The colony's medical facilities were limited. They didn't have enough resources to provide extensive care. Most of the colonists were healthy and fit, but they still needed regular checkups.

Nora stepped out of the stall and dried herself with a towel. She pulled on her jacket, then her boots. She left the room to find breakfast.

A few minutes later Nora passed through the dining hall. The tables were arranged in a square pattern, each one covered with an orange plastic tablecloth. A tall counter stood at the far end of the room, where food was served.

Nora paused to look around the room, noting the wide variety of people seated at the tables. Some of them looked up as she passed, while others stared down at their plates.

She saw a young woman with long red hair sitting alone, eating quietly. Nora wondered if she should join her. But she couldn't afford to make friends. Not yet.

At the counter, Nora ordered a bowl of cereal and a glass of juice. She sat down across from a man who was leaning over his plate to eat. He wore glasses with heavy frames, and he had dark brown skin. His black hair was cropped short in a military style.

Nora watched him for a moment before she realized what she was doing. She glanced away, embarrassed.

The man didn't seem to notice.

As Nora ate, she noticed the man's eyes were focused on her face. It made her uncomfortable. She looked back at her food, trying not to be obvious about it.

After finishing, she put the bowl and glass aside and stood up. As she walked toward the door, she heard the man call out behind her.

""Hey!""

Nora turned around. The man waved at her with a smile. She raised an eyebrow, wondering why he was so friendly.

""You're new here, aren't you?"" he asked. ""I'm Paul.""

She nodded.

212,0.4,0.7,1.0,90.0,4,47.0,"The corridor was dim, lit only by the occasional flickering emergency lights. The air smelled stale and musty. Nora paused at each door to check for activity within, but no one responded. She walked down the hall to the communal showers, where she found a long line of people waiting for hot water.

She took her place in line, letting cold water run over her face. After a few minutes, the line moved forward. Nora stepped into the steamy room to find it full of other colonists. They stood shoulder to shoulder, backs to the wall, heads bowed.

Nora looked around. Some of the colonists were crying. Others appeared dazed. A few stared blankly into space. One man was humming under his breath.

The hum stopped. Nora turned toward the source, finding herself staring straight at Valentina Kern.

Valentina smiled sadly, her eyes dark. ""I'm sorry about this.""

""What is it?""

""It's an alarm,"" Valentina said. ""We've had a drone attack. It's happened before. We're supposed to be ready for it. I wasn't expecting it so early in the morning.""

Nora could hear the urgency in her voice. She glanced at the other colonists—some of them still sobbing, others just standing there, numb.

""Is everyone okay?"" she asked.

""Yes,"" Valentina said. ""Most of us are fine. But we have a problem.""

Nora felt her heart sink. This was bad news. The colony hadn't been attacked in years, but it did happen occasionally. A drone swarm would descend on the settlement at night, when the colonists slept. They'd come in swarms of hundreds or thousands to overwhelm the humans with numbers.

Nora knew what to do. She was an engineer, after all.

She walked up behind Valentina and put her hands on the woman's shoulders. ""This isn't your fault,"" she said gently. ""You did everything you could.""

Valentina nodded, but didn't look away from Nora's gaze. ""I know. I'm sorry.""

""We'll get through this.""

Nora looked around the room. She saw fear in the eyes of some people, confusion in others. She saw a few who were simply shellshocked.

""What can we do?"" she asked.

""Nothing,"" Valentina said. ""Just wait.""

Nora frowned. ""For what? There are drones out there.""

Valentina shook her head. ""No. The drones aren't coming this time. We're safe for now.""

Nora stared at her, confused. ""Why not?""

""Because they don't want to kill us,"" Valentina said.

Nora blinked. ""They don't?""

Valentina nodded. ""The drones are here because of the aliens. They have a truce with them. The drones stay away if we don't attack first.""

Nora bit her lip. That was... unexpected. She didn't understand why the aliens didn't just destroy the colony.

Valentina continued. ""But the drones are still dangerous. And the colonists need to be ready for an attack at any moment.""

Nora nodded slowly, thinking it over. ""Okay,"" she said softly. ""So what do we do?""

""We wait,"" Valentina said. ""And hope the drones stay away.""

Nora watched Valentina walk back down the hall toward her quarters. She looked around the room again.

213,0.4,0.7,1.0,84.0,3,43.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by overhead lights, but Nora could see well enough to avoid tripping over any debris left behind from the previous night's repairs. She passed a few colonists in their rooms, each one asleep on their cots or sitting at desks, working through reports and data files.

She walked past the cafeteria, where she saw several people eating breakfast. The smell of bacon and eggs made Nora's stomach growl, so she headed for the mess hall.

As Nora entered the room, the sound of conversation died down and heads turned to look at her. Nora felt self-conscious about her appearance. In the morning light, she looked like a tired teenager who had fallen asleep in her clothes. Her hair was still mussed from sleep, and she wore no makeup.

Nora ignored the stares as she sat down at the table. She took a forkful of scrambled eggs and chewed it slowly, savoring every bite while she watched the other colonists eat.

A young man with dark brown skin and curly black hair caught her attention. He was sitting alone, his hands folded on top of the table. As Nora ate, he stared at her. When she finished her meal, he stood up and walked toward her.

""Excuse me,"" he said in a quiet voice. ""I'm sorry to disturb you.""

Nora nodded, not quite sure what to make of him. She glanced around the room, but everyone else continued eating.

""I'm Ben. I work with your father. You must be Nora?""

""Yes,"" Nora replied. ""How do you know my dad? Do we know each other?""

Ben smiled, revealing sharp teeth. ""We're friends, actually. We've worked together for a long time.""

Nora frowned at the strange comment. ""What does that mean?""

""It means your father and I have been working on this project for years now. It's been a difficult job, but it has its rewards.""

""Rewards?"" Nora asked.

""There are things worth doing, Nora. Things that matter. Your father is one of them.""

Nora didn't understand what he was saying. She felt confused.

""You don't know anything about me,"" she said. ""Why should you care if I live or die?""

Ben stared at her with a hard expression. His eyes were dark and intense, like those of an animal. They made Nora feel uncomfortable.

""I'm sorry,"" he said in a soft voice. ""That wasn't very nice.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, it was fine. I just don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you leave me alone?""

Ben sighed. ""Nora, listen to me. The colony needs you. We need your help. There are things here that shouldn't be. Things that can't be explained. I've seen them myself.""

""What? What do you mean?"" Nora asked, feeling a chill run down her spine.

""The drones,"" Ben replied. ""They're not natural. They aren't even alive.""

""How do you know that?""

""I'm an engineer. I work with technology. I've seen what they can do.""

Nora shivered, remembering the night before. She had been attacked by a swarm of drones and nearly killed.

""What are they?"" Nora asked. ""Are they aliens? Are they from another planet?""

Ben shook his head. ""I don't know. That's why we need you.

Nora felt a little claustrophobic at first, but after several minutes she grew accustomed to the confines.

She walked down the corridor toward the cafeteria, where she could grab something to eat before heading to the power plant. The cafeteria was large enough for many colonists to gather in a room filled with tables and chairs around a central area. Nora passed through the doors to find a long line of colonists waiting patiently in front of one of the stations.

The cafeteria was well stocked with food, but it was difficult to get any of it without standing in line. Nora took her place in the queue and waited.

When she reached the head of the line, she gave the woman behind the counter a polite smile. ""Good morning.""

""Morning,"" the woman said back. She was middle aged, dark skinned, and wore a white uniform. Her hair was short and black, pulled back from her face. ""What can I do for you?""

Nora glanced over the menu posted on the wall beside the register. ""I'm looking for breakfast. Do you have anything cooked yet? Eggs, bacon, toast...""

The woman shook her head. ""Not yet. We'll be serving lunch soon, though.""

""Oh... okay. Well, what about a drink or juice? Or coffee?""

The woman nodded. ""We've got some of everything. You'll want to check out the selection in the fridge first, though. It's not very good right now. The water recyclers are down again.""

Nora frowned. ""Down?""

The woman shrugged. ""It happens sometimes. But we'll get it up and running soon.""

""Okay. Thanks."" Nora turned away from the counter and walked back toward her quarters. She paused at the door, glancing back at the cafeteria. Something was different.

She stopped in her tracks and looked around. The cafeteria wasn't crowded. In fact, the tables were nearly empty, except for a few colonists who sat alone eating their meals. A couple of them had finished their lunches and left the room without paying.

Nora felt uneasy, but couldn't put her finger on why.

Then she saw it. The air was growing heavy with a thick, cloying scent. She wrinkled her nose, trying to identify the smell.

""What is that?"" she asked aloud.

A man sitting across from her at the table stood up. He wore a gray suit jacket over his white shirt. His hair was dark brown and combed back into a neat ponytail. ""Excuse me,"" he said. ""I don't mean to be rude, but I can't smell anything.""

Nora turned and looked at him. The man's face was thin and angular, and his eyes were light blue. She didn't know him. But she recognized the odor. It was death.

""The cafeteria has been closed,"" Nora replied. ""There's something wrong with it.""

***

The man stared at her for a moment, then nodded slowly.

215,0.4,0.7,1.0,76.0,5,46.0,"The corridors were quiet as she made her way to the dining hall, where a few colonists were already eating. Most of them ignored her as she passed, but a few gave her curious glances.

She wasn't accustomed to being stared at, even if the stares were mostly disapproving. Nora was used to working in isolation. Her job required a lot of thinking, planning, and problem solving. She was good at it, too. But there was something about the company's new engineer that set off alarm bells.

Nora didn't know why. She just knew it.

Nora smiled wryly as she realized that the only thing she could do was to keep on keeping on.

The dining hall was filled with tables. Nora found one near the back and sat down, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of Sully or anyone else. She was alone.

The colonists ate in silence around her. They looked tired. The colony had been up and running for months now, but the constant work never seemed to end.

Nora took a bite of her meal. It tasted like cardboard. She chewed it mechanically until she finished, then pushed the plate away.

A few colonists glanced her way. A couple of them gave her sympathetic looks. Nora was the youngest person in the colony, but she didn't look it. She was tall and lean, with dark hair and green eyes. She wore a dirty white shirt over a brown utility jacket. Her clothes were worn, but they fit well enough.

Nora was used to working hard without much sleep. She didn't need anything more than that.

But she couldn't help wondering what the Company would do if it discovered her secret.

Chapter One: Presley's Promise

Nora Decker was smart, athletic, and perceptive with green eyes and dark black hair. Nora wore utility pants, a durable jacket, a fitted shirt, and work boots.

She was the best engineer on the planet. And she knew it.

Nora didn't mind. She wasn't proud of it. But she was good at her job. She had always been good at it.

And the company wanted her to stay good at it.

Nora was a tough and determined young woman. She was also smart, athletic, and perceptive with green eyes and dark black hair. She wore a dirty white shirt over a brown utility jacket. Her clothes were worn, but they fit well enough.

Nora was the best engineer on the planet. And she knew it.

But there was something about the company's new engineer that set off alarm bells.

Nora didn't know why. She just knew it.

Nora had been working for the Company since she was a teenager. It was her home now. The Company paid her well, provided housing and food, and gave her access to top-of-the-line equipment.

The colonists were grateful. They worked hard, but they didn't have Nora's skill. She could fix anything.

216,0.4,0.7,1.0,80.0,5,45.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by flickering lights mounted on the ceiling, but the corridor itself was well-lit. The colonists didn't waste resources on unnecessary lighting. They'd been on this planet too long to be fooled by false comfort.

Nora walked briskly down the hall, passing other rooms where colonists slept in their beds. At the end of the hall, she turned left and passed through a small door to reach the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a large, rectangular space filled with tables and chairs. A row of windows ran along one wall, providing natural light to the area while letting in views of the surrounding landscape. A few colonists sat at the tables, eating breakfast from trays.

Nora spotted her friend and coworker, Jody, sitting at a table near the back of the room. She waved as Nora approached.

""Morning, Nora,"" said Jody. ""You're up early.""

""I'm not the only one,"" Nora replied.

Jody smiled. She was a slender woman with dark hair and eyes, who wore a white blouse over her utility pants. Her face was pale, but her skin was tanned and healthy.

Nora knew Jody had been born on Earth, but the colonists were a diverse group of people. They'd come here to escape the pollution and overcrowding of their home world, so it made sense for some of them to have traveled to other planets before coming to this barren planet.

Jody sat down across from Nora. ""You're right, I overslept. I didn't think you would be awake yet.""

Nora shrugged. ""It's not like we get much sleep anyway.""

""True enough. But we need to start working on the drone problem soon. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with our drones, but they're just too damn hard to fix.""

""Yeah,"" said Nora. ""I know how you feel. We've got a lot of work ahead of us.""

Jody nodded. ""We do, don't we? And if we can't solve this, then the Company will send in a new team and we'll be stuck doing their dirty work. It's not fair. We should be able to handle the drones ourselves.""

Nora sighed. She knew Jody was right. The Company wasn't going to let the colonists run the colony without supervision. They wanted to keep control of everything.

But Nora couldn't help feeling like she was being pushed into a corner. If the Company wouldn't give them the tools and resources to fix their own problems, then they needed to find another way.

""I'm sure we'll figure it out,"" said Nora. ""The Company isn't stupid.""

Jody gave her a skeptical look. ""You think so?""

Nora shrugged. ""They're always looking for ways to make more money. They'll want to keep this planet. That means they won't be leaving until we figure out how to get the drones working again.""

""Maybe,"" said Jody. ""But you know what I mean. We need to fix our own problems before we can worry about the Company's.""

Nora nodded, but she didn't agree.

217,0.4,0.7,1.0,79.0,6,48.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by the same starlight filtering through the walls, but the lights were off in the dormitories. The hallways were lined with doors to each of the rooms, but none of them opened. Instead, they led to blank, empty spaces where the colonists slept.

Nora walked down one of the halls, past several closed doors, until she came to the communal showers at the end of the corridor. She turned right to walk down a short flight of stairs to the ground level and entered the large, open space with the shower stalls lining both sides.

She sighed as the hot water hit her skin, relaxing muscles that had been knotted from hours of work. She let herself soak for a moment, enjoying the sensation of the warm spray on her back. Then she toweled off and dressed in fresh clothes before heading back to the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a long, narrow room with tables and chairs arranged around a central serving counter. The floor was polished metal grating. A few tables were scattered throughout the room, but most of the seats were taken by colonists who worked shifts in the fields or the factories. Nora spotted two people sitting near the front window, but there was no sign of anyone else.

Nora waited patiently while the line shuffled forward, then took her place at the end of it. She glanced out the window and saw that the sun hadn't risen yet. It was still dark outside. The sky above the colony was a deep purple, shading to black at the horizon.

The food on display at the front of the counter looked good. But Nora didn't have much appetite. Her stomach felt hollowed out from lack of sleep and too many late nights working. She stared hungrily at the menu, but her mind wasn't on the meal.

Nora's eyes darted across the room as she tried to spot any movement in the shadows. The colonists were busy eating breakfast, but they were a little preoccupied with their food. They ate quickly and efficiently, but not so hurriedly that they missed anything.

Nora frowned. Something was wrong.

She scanned the dining area again, looking for signs of trouble. The colonists were too focused on their meals to notice. Nora couldn't see any movement in the gloom.

Then a voice spoke up from behind her, startling Nora into jumping.

""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora turned around, startled, and found herself facing a pair of dark blue eyes. A young man stood next to the serving counter, smiling at her with an expression that was almost friendly. He wore his brown hair short and slicked back, giving him a clean-cut look. His skin was pale, but he had a healthy tan, and he held himself confidently.

He looked like a model from some high fashion magazine. Nora felt her face flush with embarrassment.

""I'm sorry,"" she stammered.

218,0.4,0.8,1.0,64.0,6,51.0,"The hallway outside was dimly lit, but she could see light filtering through cracks in the walls at intervals. The lights were set to turn off automatically after a few hours of inactivity.

Nora passed several other colonists heading to their respective duties. Most of them wore similar clothes, though there was more variety in the colors of the shirts. She saw dark blue, gray, black, and even some bright reds.

The hallways were narrow, barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. Nora kept her head down as she walked, trying not to bump into anyone else. She was careful to avoid the puddles of water that had collected along the floor.

She paused when she reached the end of the corridor, looking up at the next level where the dormitories were located. A tiny, flickering light flickered from one of the windows.

Nora glanced around, but no one was watching her. She made her way across the open space toward the window and leaned against it. The glass felt cold under her fingers and she shivered.

The lights were on in the dormitory, but the room was empty. Nora peered inside. In the dim light she could make out a few beds with blankets draped over them.

A door opened further down the hallway and a tall woman stepped into view. Nora recognized her as one of the colonists who worked in the agricultural section. She was wearing a green jumpsuit and carrying an empty bucket.

Nora turned away from the window, suddenly self conscious about being seen. She hurried off to her own quarters.

The next morning, Nora was up early again. The alarm went off at six thirty, but she didn't bother getting dressed for work. She rolled out of bed, grabbed the first clean shirt she found, and headed for the communal showers.

As she passed the dormitory, she heard a faint sound from the other side of the wall. It sounded like someone moving around inside the room. Nora stopped and listened.

She could hear the low murmur of voices. She crept closer to listen, but the language was unfamiliar.

Nora paused outside the dormitory, listening to the muffled conversation. The voice she'd heard seemed to be coming from one of the rooms.

It was a man's voice.

Nora looked at the door and frowned. She couldn't see any sign of a lock or handle. But there was no way to get inside without a key.

Nora had never been in this room before, but she knew it was one of the recreation rooms. She could make out a small table and chairs in the center of the space. There were some shelves on either side of the room, filled with books and games.

Nora moved away from the dormitory and walked around the corner. She peeked through the doorway into the recreation room, trying not to look like she was spying.

A tall man stood inside the room. He wore a white robe over his jumpsuit and held a book in front of him as he read intently. His hair was dark, thick, and curly. Nora thought he might have been handsome if the lines around his mouth hadn't drawn so sharply.

219,0.4,0.8,1.0,79.0,5,42.0,"The colony's main power plant was located at its center near the residential area. The hallways were lined with doors leading to private rooms. Nora walked past several empty rooms, pausing to peek inside each one as she passed. She paused in front of a door marked'Engineering', then turned the handle.

The room opened onto a large, well-lit space filled with rows of workstations and shelves. A long counter ran along the back wall, and a few technicians sat behind the counter. Nora recognized them from her orientation tour.

She walked up to the counter. ""Good morning."" She greeted the nearest technician, a middle-aged man with dark skin and curly hair. He wore a white lab coat over his uniform.

""Morning,"" he replied in accented English. ""I'm Dr. Tamara. How can I help you?""

Nora pointed at the row of workstations. ""Are those for me?""

Tamara smiled and nodded. ""Yes, they are. We're still working on getting your personal computer up and running.""

Nora grinned. ""I've been waiting a while for that. What's the problem?""

""It seems we have some issues with the software. We'll get it sorted out, but in the meantime, you should be able to use these."" Tamara gestured toward the workstations.

The first workstation was already occupied. The other three were empty.

""Thanks,"" Nora said, sitting down at the first workstation. ""What do I need to know about this stuff?""

""We'll go through everything together. You can start on the equipment and the tutorials. After lunch, I'll show you how to use the computers.""

Nora nodded. ""Sounds good. I'm hungry.""

""Me too,"" Tamara said. ""Let's get started.""

Nora spent the next few hours learning the basics of the colony's technology. She learned how to operate every piece of machinery in the facility, including the automated systems and the power plant.

She also had to learn how to repair and maintain the equipment herself. The colonists didn't have a dedicated maintenance crew. Instead, they relied on their own ingenuity and skill to keep everything functional.

Nora's job was to fix things when they broke down. This meant that she often worked alone or in small groups with only one or two other people around her.

When Nora was done, Tamara led her to the cafeteria for breakfast. They sat down at a table near the back wall. A large window overlooked a rocky landscape below them. The sky above was still dark, but dawn was approaching.

""You did well,"" Tamara said. ""I'll see you after lunch.""

Nora nodded. ""Thanks. See you then.""

After breakfast, Nora headed to the garage to check on the progress of repairs. She found Sully at his workstation in the command center. He was hunched over an old laptop computer, peering into its display screen with intense concentration.

Nora cleared her throat to get his attention. ""Hey, Sully. What's up?""

Sully looked up from the laptop.

220,0.4,0.8,1.0,74.0,4,43.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists at their morning duties. The small colony had only about two hundred people, so the halls were spacious and well-lit by overhead lights.

Nora walked briskly to the mess hall, where a line of colonists waited in front of the serving counter. A young woman stood behind the counter, dressed in a bright red uniform. She smiled when Nora approached.

""Good morning, Miss Decker,"" she said cheerfully. ""Is there anything I can get you?""

Nora shook her head. ""No thanks.""

The girl nodded, then turned to the next person in line. She was tall and slender with black hair, dark eyes, and olive skin. Nora thought she looked familiar.

She glanced around the room while waiting for her food. The colonists here weren't quite as pale as those on Earth, but they were still mostly white. Nora couldn't remember seeing anyone who wasn't Caucasian.

A man in a blue jumpsuit came up beside her. He wore his blond hair long and loose, tied back in a ponytail. His face was angular and handsome with deep-set gray eyes and high cheekbones.

""Morning, miss,"" he said. ""I'm Liam.""

Nora gave him a polite nod. The colonists' names were all prefixed by their assigned job titles.

""You're new, aren't you?"" Liam asked. ""We've been here about three years. You'll fit right in.""

Nora smiled wryly and shrugged. ""Maybe,"" she said. ""But I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this pace up.""

Liam chuckled. ""It's tough, isn't it? But you'll get used to it.""

""Yeah,"" Nora agreed. ""If we don't die first."" She took a bite of her breakfast. It was bland and tasteless, but she forced herself to eat it anyway.

Liam watched her. ""You have a problem with the food?""

Nora shook her head. ""No, I just haven't had time to cook anything yet. My shift starts in half an hour.""

""I'll give you some pointers,"" Liam said. ""There are plenty of recipes on the Company data files. We can find something for everyone.""

""Thanks,"" Nora said. She finished eating and pushed her tray aside. ""I'll see you later.""

Nora left the mess hall and headed down a corridor toward engineering. The colony's artificial intelligence system, called 'The Company', ran everything from the lights to the water supply. It also maintained the colonists'machinery.

Eve was the AI's name. Eve was a disembodied, female voice with a soothing tone. Nora found it unnerving to hear her talk without seeing her face.

She walked past the hydroponic greenhouses and waste processors, where automated systems purred quietly in the background. A few colonists were working nearby, but most of the facility was empty except for a few maintenance robots and drones.

Nora passed through the command center and stopped at the door to her own quarters. She opened it and stepped inside. The room was small, dark, and cramped, with only a bed, a desk, and a chair.

A window looked out over the landscape. Nora sat on the edge of her bed and stared out into the foggy morning. She didn't feel like going back to sleep.

221,0.4,0.8,1.0,73.0,4,44.0,"The colony's main hallways were dimly lit by recessed lights set at intervals along the ceiling. The walls were covered in metallic grating, giving the entire hallway a cavernous feel. She walked down the long corridor to the cafeteria where she found breakfast already waiting for her: eggs and bacon, toast, coffee, orange juice, and a glass of milk.

Nora sat down at one of the tables and began eating. Her stomach rumbled appreciatively as she chewed and swallowed. After finishing the meal, she drank the last of her orange juice.

She took a drink from her mug, then leaned back in her chair to look around. The cafeteria was empty save for the few colonists who'd come down early for their breakfasts. Nora studied the other diners, wondering if any of them might be able to help her.

After a moment, she spotted a young man sitting at another table. He wore a white lab coat over a blue button-up shirt and black slacks. His hair was brown and short, his eyes were dark green, and he had an angular face with a small nose, high cheekbones, and a thin mouth.

Nora glanced away, embarrassed by her own thoughts. She cleared her throat before speaking up. ""Excuse me, but do you know anything about the colony's power grid?""

The man looked up at her and smiled politely. ""I'm sorry, I don't speak English.""

""Oh,"" Nora said. ""Sorry.""

She turned away, feeling foolish. The man hadn't even bothered to learn the language of the people he would be working with. She felt a surge of anger toward him.

She took another sip from her mug, then set it on the table. Her gaze drifted back to the man across the room. He was still smiling at her.

Nora stood and walked over to his table. ""I'm Nora Decker,"" she said. ""You're Dr. Chen, right? I've been assigned to your team.""

He nodded. ""Yes, I remember you. You asked me about the power grid earlier, but I didn't understand what you meant. Would you mind explaining?""

Nora sat down. ""Sure. The colonists are running low on power because their equipment keeps breaking down."" She pointed at the overhead lights. ""These lights won't turn off when they should. Sometimes, we have to use hand tools instead of power loaders.""

Dr. Chen nodded again. ""That's true. The grid is full of problems. It was built before the Company came, so it's old and inefficient. We can fix some things, but there are others that will take time. The colony has to rely on its own resources.""

""What do you mean'its own resources?'"" Nora asked.

The doctor shook his head. ""We don't get shipments of new parts from the company. Everything we need comes from our own stores.""

Nora frowned. ""So how does a colony like this survive?""

""By scavenging,"" Dr. Chen said. ""We collect spare parts and materials from other colonies. The more advanced the technology, the easier it is to find the components. We trade them for food, water, shelter, medicine, fuel... anything we need.""

""How long have you been here?"" Nora asked.

""Six months. I was sent with the first wave of colonists.""

""And you've never seen an alien before?""

Dr. Chen smiled. ""Not until today, no.""

Nora laughed nervously.

222,0.4,0.8,1.0,80.0,4,46.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by small lamps spaced at intervals, but the lights worked well enough to guide her through the maze of hallways. The colony's central power plant was located in the middle of the complex, and it was there that she found a handful of colonists already awake.

Nora greeted them with a nod and a smile as she passed. They nodded back, their faces tired and drawn. Some looked pale, others red-eyed from lack of sleep. She wondered if they'd been up late last night working on repairs.

Nora made her way to the cafeteria where the smell of fresh coffee wafted over her. She hurried inside, grabbed a mug, and headed for the nearest table. She sat down next to an older man with dark hair and a bushy beard. He was sitting alone, staring off into space.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm sorry I didn't get you breakfast.""

He glanced at her and smiled.

""No worries. You're our resident engineer, right?"" he asked.

Nora nodded. ""Yeah, that's me. What about you? Are you a prospector or an explorer?""

The older man chuckled. ""Neither one. Just a simple farmer. Been here since the beginning, but I'm not much of a hand with machinery.""

Nora's eyebrows rose in surprise. ""Really? That surprises me. You look like someone who could be handy around machines.""

""Not really. But I've learned how to make do with what we have. It's better than going back to the Company and asking for help, anyway. They wouldn't give us any.""

Nora nodded. She understood. If she'd been born into this colony, she would have done the same thing.

""What did you do before you came here?"" Nora asked.

The man shrugged. ""I was a mechanic for a while, but then I got tired of it. Now I just farm, and my wife does all the work. We live on the edge of town. You should see our place. It's pretty rough. But it's ours.""

""You're lucky,"" Nora said. ""We don't get many farmers here. Most people are prospectors or explorers.""

The man nodded. ""That's why I'm glad you're here. You'll know what to do.""

Nora smiled at him. She liked the way he spoke, so matter-of-factly.

""Thanks for saying that.""

She finished her coffee and headed back to her quarters to change into the clothes she'd brought from home. The suit was a little tight, but she wore it anyway because of the cold climate.

The hallways were still dark when she arrived at the command center. She stepped inside, and the lights brightened automatically. Nora paused in front of a large display screen, where an image of a barren planet filled the wall. It was an infrared scan of the surface taken from orbit.

Nora studied the image, which showed the colony's location on a map floating above the screen. The colony had been built in the shadow of a mountain range, and its position allowed for only limited access to sunlight.

223,0.4,0.8,1.0,66.0,3,46.0,"The first thing she noticed about the colony was how quiet it was. The colonists were supposed to be working hard, but they weren't. Most of them had already left their beds for breakfast.

Nora walked past the cafeteria, where a handful of people stood in line at the counter. She passed the command center where Sully sat behind one of the desks, talking on the phone. He waved to her as she walked by.

The corridors were empty except for Nora's footsteps echoing off the walls. She paused outside the dormitories to check the time. She'd been gone from her room less than five minutes, but it felt like hours.

She entered the dormitory hallways, stepping over the sleeping bodies of other colonists. She saw no signs of life, not even a whisper of movement.

Nora stopped in front of her assigned door, a small metal slab with a round window set into the top half. A red light blinked inside the window, indicating that the occupant was still asleep. She knocked twice on the door, then waited.

The red light turned green and Nora pushed open the door.

The room was dark and silent. Nora stepped in cautiously, holding her breath until she could see clearly.

In the dim glow of the nightstand lamp, she saw an empty bed. The covers were neatly tucked back, but there wasn't a single sign that someone had spent the night in it.

Nora frowned as she looked around the room. There was no note left behind, nothing to indicate who might have slept here last night.

She shook her head. It didn't make sense. Someone should have been up at this hour. She'd heard the alarm go off. But no one answered when she knocked on the door.

Nora sighed and walked out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her. Her next stop was the cafeteria, where she found Sully sitting alone at a table near the entrance. He waved to her with his fork.

""Hey,"" he said cheerfully. ""You're late.""

""Yeah, I know.""

Sully nodded knowingly. ""I figured you'd be tired after your shift. You've been working hard, so it's no surprise that you're beat. What do you want for breakfast?""

Nora shrugged. She hadn't thought about food yet. ""Anything. Just don't expect me to cook it myself.""

""Don't worry. We'll get you something good."" He smiled. ""I'm going to grab a bite before my own shift. Want anything from the commissary?""

Nora shook her head. ""No thanks. I'll just wait for the others.""

He grinned. ""Good luck with that. They should be here soon.""

Nora glanced at the clock. It was only a few minutes until eight o'clock, but it felt like hours had passed. She'd been awake for more than twelve hours now and she was exhausted.

She sighed again. ""I need sleep.""

""Sure,"" Sully said agreeably, ""but I'll see you later. Try not to fall asleep on the job, okay?""

Nora laughed despite herself. ""Yeah, right. Thanks for the advice.""

Sully waved goodbye and headed toward the cafeteria. Nora watched him go. He looked so... normal. So comfortable. She couldn't imagine how he could stand being cooped up inside this place every day.

She shook her head. It was a wonder anyone survived here at all.

The door to the dormitory hall opened and two colonists walked out into the corridor together. One of them wore a dark blue jumpsuit and the other was dressed in a long white lab coat.

224,0.4,0.8,1.0,83.0,5,48.0,"The air was chilly, but not cold. The sun hadn't yet risen far enough to heat the rocky surface of the planet. She shivered, glad for the warmth of her clothes.

The colony's main hall was dimly lit by a few emergency lights. A few colonists were already awake, moving about in small groups. Others slept, their breathing slow and regular.

Nora walked past the dormitory bays where she shared a room with several other women. Her roommate was still asleep.

She passed the command center where the Company executives gathered to plan the day's work. The door was closed, but Nora could hear voices inside. She paused at the entrance, listening.

""... don't know what happened,"" one of the men said. ""The system is acting up again.""

""We need more time for repairs, sir,"" another man replied.

The first voice sounded tired and annoyed. ""You've had weeks to get this thing working right! We can't afford to spend any more time here than we have to. If you can't fix it, I'll find someone who can.""

Nora stepped back from the door. She didn't want to eavesdrop on the Company's business, but the thought of being trapped underground with no way out was too much to bear.

She turned away and headed for the cafeteria, which was a large room filled with tables and chairs arranged around a central kitchen. There were two long rows of food stations set up along the walls. The din of conversation and clatter of utensils was loud in the room, but she couldn't make out any words. Nora stopped at a station and ordered breakfast with her meal card.

A few minutes later, the server brought her a tray loaded down with hot, steaming food. She sat down at one of the empty tables and dug into the meal, shoveling eggs and bacon into her mouth while she waited for her coffee.

The colony's automated systems were designed to handle most everything. But when they broke down, it was up to the colonists to fix them. Nora had been doing just that since she arrived three months ago, working tirelessly to repair and maintain the colony's equipment.

She ate quickly and drank some coffee before heading back to the dormitory. She'd already showered, changed clothes, and brushed her teeth. Now she needed sleep. Her shift started early, and there was plenty to do if she wanted to get any rest.

Nora crawled into bed and pulled the covers over herself. It was only 9 AM, but it felt like she hadn't slept at all.

She closed her eyes and tried to relax. The hard work of repairing the colony's equipment would keep her busy for hours. She wouldn't have time to think about what had happened last night, or even to worry about it.

But the nightmares came anyway.

***

Nora woke up with a start, her heart pounding in her chest.

She sat up in bed, blinking rapidly to clear her vision.

225,0.4,0.8,1.0,81.0,6,46.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading toward the dining area. The colony's cafeteria was small but well-stocked, offering a wide selection of food. Nora passed through the kitchen and walked along the corridor to the communal showers at the end of the hall past a row of private rooms.

She stopped outside one door, listening for sounds from within. When she heard nothing, Nora slid open the door and peeked inside. Empty. She slipped inside, closing the door behind her.

The room was dark, but a faint glow filtered in through the translucent plastic walls. Nora stood still, letting her eyes adjust to the dimness. She could see shadows moving in the corners of the room as the other colonists arrived for their morning routines.

Nora stepped forward and examined the shower heads. They were simple, metal fixtures with a single showerhead and a drain in the floor. The water pressure was low, but Nora knew that meant it would be hot. She turned the faucet on and waited for the water to heat up.

The water was warm, but not scalding. Nora stripped off her clothes and stepped under the stream, sighing in relief. The water felt good on her sore muscles and scrapes. It was nice to wash away the accumulated grime of a long, hard day.

After rinsing herself clean, Nora dried off and dressed again. She pulled on the utility pants and jacket before heading back down the hallway toward the dining area.

As she walked along the corridor, Nora passed a few colonists who were already at the tables eating breakfast. Some looked up as she passed, but no one spoke to her. She kept walking.

226,0.4,0.8,1.0,87.0,5,48.0,"The hallway outside was empty, but she could hear the low murmur of voices coming from the cafeteria. She walked toward the sound, passing the dormitories at the end of the hall. The doors were closed, but the lights inside glowed dimly.

Nora slowed as she approached the cafeteria door. Her stomach growled. She fished in her pocket for the keycard that opened the door, then hesitated.

She wasn't supposed to go to the cafeteria. Not yet.

But Nora had been up late fixing a malfunctioning airlock, and after eating nothing but stale rations for days, her body craved real food. She needed something to soak up the grease from the dinner she'd eaten last night—the first meal she'd had in almost two weeks.

Nora turned the card over in her hand, feeling the cold metal cool under her fingers. She pressed it down and slid it into the slot. The lock clicked open with a soft hum that faded away as the door swung inward.

Nora stepped through the doorway, which was just wide enough to let her pass. She stood still for a moment, letting her eyes adjust to the dim lighting.

The cafeteria was huge, stretching across one entire wall. It looked like an industrial warehouse, filled with rows of tables and chairs, long counters, and white walls. The place smelled like fried food and coffee, but the scent didn't reach her nose.

Nora's gut clenched as she realized that the cafeteria was empty. No people sat at any of the tables, no workers walked along the counters. She was alone in this vast space.

She took a step forward and stopped again. A few steps more brought her into the main area of the room, where she could see the counter on the far side.

A row of machines lined the countertop. They were tall and bulky, with dials and buttons that glowed red or blue. Some had lights blinking in the front, others hummed softly. The machines'faces were blank, but Nora knew without asking what they did.

They were computers.

Nora stared at them for a long moment, then turned around and walked out of the cafeteria. She felt the cold metal door click shut behind her.

She needed to get to work.

The airlock was on the other side of the colony, so Nora headed back toward her quarters. As she passed through the dormitories, she heard voices coming from one room.

Nora froze. She'd been told not to go into the dormitory rooms. But the voices sounded female.

Nora crept closer, peering through a crack in the doorway. The room was small, with two beds and a desk. A woman sat at the desk, hunched over a computer screen. Her dark hair hung down her back, but she wore it pulled back into a tight ponytail.

She looked up as Nora stepped inside. The woman's eyes widened, and she jumped off the bed. She backed away from Nora, holding out both hands in front of her.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora said. ""I didn't mean to intrude.""

The woman lowered her arms, but she still kept her distance. She glanced at the door, then turned to face Nora.

Nora frowned.

227,0.4,0.8,1.0,83.0,4,42.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by emergency lights. The colony's power plant pulsed softly, its glow barely visible through the wall grating. A few colonists were already awake, moving about in the halls and dormitories.

Nora turned left toward the cafeteria. She passed a couple of other workers heading the opposite direction. They nodded at her as they walked past.

A few minutes later, she arrived at the cafeteria. It was empty except for two men sitting at one end of the long counter. She took a seat beside them.

""Morning,"" Nora said.

The older man nodded back, but he didn't say anything. He wore a faded, tattered uniform with patches on the sleeves and shoulders. His hair was thinning, and his face was deeply lined from years of sun exposure and hard work.

Nora smiled, trying to put him at ease. ""I'm Nora.""

He looked up at her and gave a curt nod.

""You're the commander?""

His eyes narrowed suspiciously, then his gaze flicked over her shoulder. He stood abruptly, knocking his chair over backward.

""Commander Kern, I presume?""

Nora turned around. A tall woman with dark skin and short black hair had just entered the cafeteria. Her clothes were military fatigues, and her boots were polished and sharp. She carried a large rifle slung across her chest.

Nora nodded back. ""Yes. Who are you?""

The woman's eyes glinted in the dim light of the cafeteria. ""My name is Valentina Kern, and this is my colony.""

""Your colony? You mean this place?"" Nora gestured at the room around them. ""It looks like a bunch of old junk.""

Kern shook her head. ""No, it isn't junk. It's our future.""

Nora blinked in confusion. ""What do you mean?""

""We've been mining the planet for resources. The Company sent us here to find a new source of minerals. We found them instead.""

Nora stared at her, then glanced over at the other man who'd introduced himself as Captain Voss. He nodded back.

""The Company's been sending out expeditions to explore the planet,"" he explained. ""They started finding mineral deposits on the surface, but they kept blowing up. Then we got word about an underground hive. They sent a team down there to investigate and discovered the aliens. That's when we realized what was happening.""

Nora looked back at Kern. ""So you're saying these monsters are from space?""

""That's right. The Company sent us here because it wanted to use the colony as a base of operations to mine the planet. But now, the Company wants to destroy everything we've built.""

""Destroy? Why would they want to do that?""

Kern shrugged. ""Because they can't control the planet anymore. We have the technology to tap into its resources and manufacture goods for sale in the colonies. The Company doesn't think we'll be able to do that if their machines break down.""

Nora frowned. ""But... why are you telling me this?""

Kern smiled coldly. ""I don't trust the Company. I'm going to take my colony and leave Presley's Promise before they can stop us. You should come with me.""

""Why?""

228,0.4,0.9,1.0,72.0,5,48.0,"The corridor outside her dormitory was empty. She passed by the communal showers where she could hear the other colonists already rinsing off, then turned toward the cafeteria for some food. The narrow hallways were lined with doors to the various residential units, offices, and storage bays.

She paused at the first door on her right, a small room with a single bed and desk, facing the hallway. This was her room. She opened the door and stepped inside.

The room was sparsely furnished, but it had everything she needed. A window looked out over the landscape, which Nora found herself gazing at with uncharacteristic interest. She wondered what kind of plants grew here. Were there any edible varieties?

Nora stepped back from the window and pulled her jacket closed, then sat down on the edge of the bed to pull on her boots. She didn't need shoes in the dormitory, but she wore them anyway because they were practical and comfortable.

The boots made her feel more like an engineer than a colonist. She stood up and stretched her arms above her head, feeling the muscles pop as she did so. Her body felt good, even after a long day of work. But the restlessness that came with being awake was still gnawing at her.

Nora sighed and grabbed her jacket, then walked out into the hall again. She passed the cafeteria where the smell of hot food filled the air. She paused briefly to study the menu posted on the wall, but decided she'd rather eat something from home.

At the end of the corridor was a door marked EXIT. Nora opened it and stepped outside onto a wide landing overlooking the main courtyard. The sun had just risen, and the sky was brightening in shades of blue and purple.

She headed toward the commissary, which was adjacent to the mess hall. It was a large, open space with tables and chairs arranged around the perimeter. A few colonists were already there, sitting at various tables or standing near one of the big windows along the front wall.

Nora stopped in front of a table and watched as a young woman set down a tray full of steaming dishes. She glanced up, caught sight of Nora, and smiled.

""Good morning,"" she said cheerfully. ""I'm Marisol.""

Nora nodded back. ""Hi. I'm Nora. You're new here?""

""Yes. I arrived last night. But I've been assigned to work with you today.""

""Oh, really? What are we working on?""

Marisol giggled. ""You'll see when you get there. I'm supposed to be your assistant for the day. We have a lot of work to do.""

Nora frowned and looked at the other colonists. They were all staring at her, their eyes wide and expectant. She didn't like being the center of attention so early in the morning. The colonists must think she was some kind of celebrity.

She turned back to Marisol. ""Well, let's go eat. I don't want to miss breakfast.""

The two women walked side by side toward the mess hall. Nora felt a little awkward, but she forced herself not to look away from Marisol. Her companion was pretty, with long dark hair and a slender figure.

229,0.4,0.9,1.0,91.0,5,47.0,"The hallway outside her door was dimly lit by the faint glow from the corridor lights, but she could see well enough to navigate without stumbling over anything. The hallways were lined with doors, each housing a single room. She passed a few colonists heading in opposite directions toward the mess hall and their shifts, but everyone seemed to be up early.

Nora stopped at the end of the hall to wait for the elevator. The lift was small, cramped, and slow. It took forever to get to the top floor where the engineering bay was located.

She stepped inside the elevator and pressed the button for the first floor. Nora leaned back against the wall, eyes closed as she listened to the mechanical hum of the cables above her head.

The elevator came to a stop with a soft ding! and Nora opened her eyes to see the doors slide open. She stepped out into the hallway, and the doors slid shut behind her.

Nora walked down the hall and entered the mess hall, which was filled with people milling about in anticipation of breakfast. It smelled like bacon.

When she got to the table, she saw a man and woman sitting across from each other. They both looked up at her, then turned back to their food.

""Good morning,"" Nora said.

The couple didn't respond.

Nora sat down in the chair next to them and waited. She wasn't going anywhere until someone spoke.

After a moment, the woman finally grunted, ""Morning.""

Nora nodded.

""What's your name?"" asked the man.

""Nora Decker.""

""I'm Tom Carmichael."" He extended his hand.

Nora shook it, and he pulled her into a bear hug. She felt his warm, strong arms around her back and squeezed him gently before letting go.

Tom released Nora and continued eating while she went to the counter for some coffee. The Colony was built on the ruins of an old mining colony, so they had plenty of supplies.

Nora took her mug of black coffee to a table near the door. She sipped it slowly as she watched the colonists milling about in the mess hall. A few minutes later, Sully came out and started making announcements.

""Attention, everyone,"" Sully said. ""It's time to get to work.""

Nora finished her cup and set it down. She stood up and headed toward the elevators, but stopped when she saw a group of people standing in front of the cafeteria entrance. They were carrying large metal trays loaded with food, and they looked like they'd been there awhile.

Nora stepped closer to see what was going on. One of the men turned and spotted her. He smiled at her, then walked over to where she stood.

""Good morning, Nora.""

She nodded.

""I'm John Smith. I'm the head cook here,"" he said. ""You can call me Chef John if you want.""

Nora smiled politely.

""This is my wife, Mary."" He gestured to a woman in the kitchen behind him. She was dressed in a white chef's uniform and had short brown hair.

230,0.4,0.9,1.0,82.0,4,45.0,"Nora followed the sound of voices to the cafeteria, where she found Sully and several other colonists already eating. The large room held a long table and benches for the colonists. A few of the colonists were still sleeping off their shifts, while others sat in small groups talking quietly.

Sully stood at the head of the table and waved Nora over when he spotted her. She walked up to him with a smile, but he shook his head. ""No time,"" he said. ""We're working on the power plant.""

""Oh, right,"" Nora replied. She glanced around the room. ""Where's Kory?""

""He's in engineering,"" Sully answered. He pointed to the far side of the room, where a man in a lab coat was bent over a workstation.

Nora nodded and headed for the door. As she passed the tables, people gave her curious looks. She didn't care; she had a job to do.

The corridor outside the cafeteria was narrow and dimly lit, barely wide enough for two colonists to walk abreast. Nora followed the sound of voices until she reached the end of the hall where a pair of doors opened into an adjoining room. The room was brightly lit and filled with noise from machinery and electronic equipment. Nora could hear the whine of generators and the clank of heavy metal tools.

She stopped in the doorway, blinking at the sight before her. A tall, lean woman with short brown hair and a broad, friendly face stood next to a workbench covered with electronic components. She wore a thick leather jacket over a blue jumpsuit and looked up when Nora entered the room.

""Nora,"" she said. ""I'm Dr. Chen.""

""Hello, Director Rowena,"" Nora replied. She took a deep breath. ""I'll start my shift in half an hour. I need to get breakfast now.""

Rowena smiled and nodded. ""Come on back here. We'll eat together.""

Nora felt her stomach rumble at the thought of food, but she forced herself to say, ""Okay. Thanks."" She walked over to the workbench and leaned against it.

""You're new?"" Rowena asked.

""Yes. I just started last week.""

""Nice to meet you. My name is Nora. You can call me Doctor if you want,"" Rowena said. She gestured toward the bench. ""We've got some work to do. Come help us out.""

Nora nodded and followed her to the workbench. Rowena sat down at a computer terminal and typed rapidly, then turned to Nora with a smile. ""Let's see what we have here.""

Nora glanced around the room. Electronics were everywhere, from consoles and terminals to circuit boards and wires. A large metal box stood next to one of the walls and a small generator hummed nearby.

""What are we working on?"" Nora asked.

Rowena pointed at the metal box and said, ""That's our power plant."" She tapped at the keyboard again and frowned.

231,0.4,0.9,1.0,95.0,4,44.0,"The halls were quiet as she made her way to the communal kitchen area. The colonists ate their meals together in a large room, where they could sit at long tables surrounded by benches. A few other people sat around the edges of the room, but most of the seats were empty.

Nora passed through the kitchen, where a dozen women worked beside another dozen men. They smiled when they saw her, but Nora didn't return the greeting. She walked past them to the end of the hall.

At the far end was the cafeteria. Nora entered the room and found it filled with rows of tables set up for three hundred people. The ceiling was high enough that the lights above the tables cast shadows from the columns of windows overhead.

Nora scanned the room. All the colonists had gathered here to eat. She spotted her friends, Raul, and Liana sitting at one table near the back corner. She headed over to join them.

As Nora approached, Raul glanced up. His eyes widened in surprise and he got to his feet. He stood aside as Nora slid into the seat across from him.

""Morning,"" she said.

Raul nodded, smiling. ""Good morning.""

Liana turned her head to look at Nora. Her expression was unreadable behind the thick lenses of her glasses.

Nora leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. ""How's it going?""

""Well enough,"" said Liana.

""I'm glad to hear it,"" Nora replied.

""You're looking pretty rough this morning,"" Raul observed.

""Yeah, I know. I slept in late. It'll take me a while to get my mind right.""

""Oh, no problem. We'll wait for you,"" Liana said.

Nora nodded and glanced around the room. The other colonists were eating their meals or talking quietly.

She looked back at Raul. ""What did you do last night?""

He frowned. ""Last night? Nothing much. Just played some cards, watched some vids. You?""

""Same,"" Nora said.

""Didn't sleep well, huh?"" Liana asked.

Nora shrugged. ""Not really.""

Raul glanced at Liana. ""I didn't think so,"" he said.

Liana smiled. ""It's nothing to worry about. I'm sure you'll be fine once we get started.""

Nora grunted and turned back to her breakfast.

A few minutes later, Nora joined the colonists for breakfast. They ate in silence, but Raul and Liana made eye contact with Nora from time to time.

After they finished their meal, everyone headed out of the cafeteria to begin their day. The colonists worked in shifts, and most went straight to their jobs. But a small group gathered near the entrance and waited for Nora.

She was surprised to see a woman standing there.

""Good morning,"" she said.

The woman nodded, her dark eyes bright and alert behind her glasses. She wore a long black coat over a gray uniform. Her hair was cut short on one side, longer on the other.

""I'm Nora Decker,"" Nora said. ""Who are you?""

The woman extended a hand. ""I'm Doctor Brandy.""

Nora shook it. ""Nice to meet you. What's your job here?""

Doctor Brandy smiled. ""I'm an engineer.""

232,0.4,0.9,1.0,90.0,5,44.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty. The lights flickered, illuminating dim patches of dust. Nora walked past the communal showers, where she could hear water running, and turned toward the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was a large room filled with long tables, each one lined up along the walls. At the head of each table sat a small box, its screen glowing softly. A few colonists were already there, but most of the tables were vacant. In the center of the room was a wide serving counter, stocked with food from the automated kitchens.

Nora made her way to the front counter, where she found a handful of colonists already waiting in line.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted them cheerfully. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

A man at the end of the line spoke up. He had short brown hair, a thin mustache, and a wispy beard. His eyes were pale blue and his skin was dark olive.

""Rafael Alvarez. I work in the hydroponics section.""

Nora nodded. She'd seen Rafael before, but he didn't look familiar.

""You're new?""

He shook his head. ""No, but I've been here for a year now. We don't get many people transferred from the Company. This is my first time working in hydroponics.""

""Welcome to the colony."" Nora smiled. ""How do you like it so far?""

""It's... different, but I think I can handle it.""

Nora looked around the room. The colonists were a diverse group of men and women, ranging from teenagers to retirees. They wore a variety of clothing, though most of them were dressed in utilitarian utility clothing. Nora thought they might be more comfortable if their clothes fit better, but the Company had strict rules about personal style.

""What are you doing today?"" she asked Rafael.

""I have a shift in hydroponics."" He pointed toward the end of the counter where a woman in a lab coat stood behind the serving area. ""I'll probably start there.""

""See you later then,"" Nora said, smiling at him again.

Rafael nodded and moved away from the counter. Nora turned back to her breakfast. She picked up a plate filled with eggs, bacon, toast, and orange juice. The food was cold, but Nora didn't care. It tasted wonderful after the long night's work.

She sat down on one of the empty tables and dug into her meal. As she ate, she watched Rafael walk out of the cafeteria. He paused briefly in front of the hydroponics section before disappearing through a door marked 'Employees Only'.

Nora finished her meal and washed it down with some coffee. She set her cup aside and walked over to the hydroponics section.

The door opened automatically for her, and she stepped inside. The air smelled of chemicals, but the lights were bright enough that she could see clearly. Nora scanned the rows of hydroponic tanks, which were lined up along the walls like rows of fruit trees.

""Hello,"" Nora called. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

233,0.4,0.9,1.0,82.0,3,42.0,"The colony's communal hallways were filled with colonists hurrying to their jobs. Most wore work boots, heavy coats, and hooded jackets over their shirts. They moved in a slow shuffle as they rushed past each other, some talking quietly while others walked alone.

Nora was late. She hurried through the halls, trying to get to the mess hall in time for breakfast. The hallway lights flickered erratically, but she didn't notice. Her eyes were fixed on one particular spot in the distance.

A man stood at the end of the corridor. He looked like he was waiting for Nora to pass him, but when she drew closer, she saw that he wasn't. His head turned toward her, his dark brown hair falling across his forehead and shoulders. She stopped dead in her tracks, feeling a chill run down her spine.

The stranger stared at Nora. He was tall and broad shouldered with a lean build and a square jaw. Dark blue eyes glinted from under thick brows. He wore a black leather jacket over a white T-shirt, loose jeans, and heavy boots. A long, curved sword hung from a belt loop near his hip.

Nora felt her heart hammering in her chest. Her mouth went dry. She couldn't move, couldn't speak, didn't know what to do or say. The stranger's gaze was intense, almost hypnotic.

He took a step forward. Nora backed up until she bumped into the wall behind her. Then he spoke. ""You are late for work.""

Nora gulped, then squeaked out an unintelligible reply. Her voice sounded thin and reedy in her ears.

""I am not a machine,"" he said. His accent was strange, like Nora had never heard it before. It reminded her of something, but she couldn't quite place it.

""Yes, you're right,"" Nora whispered. She threw a quick glance around the hall, looking for any way out. The stranger was blocking the only exit. But there were no other colonists nearby. No one else seemed to notice them.

""Are you new here?"" the man asked. He stepped closer. ""You look lost.""

Nora swallowed, her heart thumping so hard that she could feel it in her throat. She didn't want to answer, but he was going to make her. Her eyes darted back toward the door, but it was too far away.

The stranger stared at Nora. His face was calm and expressionless. ""What is your name?""

Nora's mouth went dry again. She shook her head, trying to get rid of the feeling. What was wrong with her? Why did he have such an effect on her?

""Nora,"" she croaked out.

""Nora,"" he repeated, his voice quiet. He took another step forward. ""Why are you late for work?""

Nora tried to swallow, but her throat was too tight. She couldn't speak. Her eyes felt hot and heavy.

""Answer me,"" the stranger said.

""I..."" Nora choked. ""I overslept.""

He nodded once.

234,0.4,0.9,1.0,95.0,4,43.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists heading to their duties, but Sully's office was open, so Nora went in search of him. The command center was a maze of offices and conference rooms filled with soft lighting and plush furniture. A large wall screen displayed the planet's surface, which was covered in clouds and misty fog. The colony was surrounded by rocky cliffs, craggy peaks, and towering spires.

Nora found Sully at the end of one of the halls, leaning over his desk, and looked up as she approached. He was dressed in a dark suit with a white shirt and tie. His hair was slicked back into place, and he wore glasses.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm looking for you.""

Sully straightened, smiling. ""Morning is a relative term. I've been awake since before dawn.""

Nora nodded. ""I know. You're always up early.""

""It's my job to be. I can't sleep much, so I get up and do it again. It's a habit."" Sully stood up, stretching his arms above his head. ""But I'm glad you came. I have some good news for you.""

""Oh?"" Nora asked. ""What's that?""

""You'll be going out on your first mission today. We've got a new prospector who needs help with the equipment. She's not an engineer, but she knows her way around the field gear. She'll need to learn how to use the tools and how to work with a team. But she has a knack for trouble, so we'll see if she can handle herself.""

""Sounds like fun,"" Nora said. ""Where is this new girl?""

Sully smiled. ""She'll meet us in the garage. I'm sure you'll find her quite interesting.""

Nora nodded. ""I hope so.""

The garage was a large, open area filled with rows of vehicles and power loaders. The colonists used them to transport supplies from one location to another, or to haul heavy machinery when they needed it. A few of the larger loads were being unloaded and loaded into storage containers.

A group of colonists stood nearby talking among themselves, while a woman with long brown hair sat on a low stool beside a small pile of equipment. She wore loose pants and a dark jacket over a white shirt. Her face bore a pleasant smile, but Nora couldn't tell what she looked like under her helmet.

""Hey,"" said Sully. ""This is Nora Decker. She'll be joining you today.""

""Hi,"" Nora said. ""Are you the new prospector?""

The woman nodded and smiled. ""I'm Lola.""

Nora shook hands with her. ""Lola, I'm Nora.""

""Nice to meet you. I'm glad you're here.""

Nora nodded. ""So am I.""

Nora had been out on missions before, but never like this. She was nervous. In fact, the more she thought about it, the more nervous she became.

The mission was simple enough. They would go to a new mining site and set up camp for a few days.

235,0.4,0.9,1.0,72.0,4,47.0,"The hallways were empty except for the occasional maintenance drone scurrying about its tasks. The colony's power plant hummed along, but the air conditioning wasn't working. Nora shivered as she walked past the cold vents in the walls. The temperature was still too low to be comfortable.

She passed a couple of colonists who were already up and moving. One man was pulling on his boots while the other was checking the sealant around the hull of one of the larger cargo haulers. Nora nodded to them, then continued to the mess hall.

The mess hall was filled with people at the tables eating. Nora took a seat near the back of the room, where the heat from the cooking stove warmed her skin. She pulled out a tray of scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast.

As she ate, Nora watched the others in the room. Most of the colonists were young men and women in their early twenties. They were lean and strong with short hair and dark eyes. Some had scarred faces and missing teeth. Others wore thick glasses. A few of the colonists were older, but none of them looked like they'd seen more than a handful of years.

Nora was one of the oldest members of the colony. Her face was lined, her hair mostly gray, and she was taller than most of the colonists. She was also the best engineer here.

She didn't fit in.

The colonists were rough around the edges. But Nora was different. She was tough, smart, and focused. And she was good at what she did.

Her parents died when she was very young. Nora was raised by her grandparents. She never met them, but she knew their stories. They were both engineers who worked for the Company. They lived on Earth before it was destroyed.

Nora's father designed and built new technologies, while her mother helped him test and improve those designs. He died in a terrible accident. Her mother survived the destruction of their home world, but she was badly injured. She spent years recovering in the hospital. When Nora was old enough to understand, her grandmother told her about the colony.

Nora was born on the colony. Her grandfather was an engineer there. His work kept the lights on. The colony was a place where no one could die. It was a safe haven.

But even though she was born here, Nora wasn't like the other colonists. She didn't have family. Not anymore.

That was why she'd been so tired lately. Even though she hadn't slept much, she still felt exhausted.

She finished her breakfast and pushed away from the table. As she stood up, Nora caught sight of herself in the mirror. She grimaced at her reflection. Her hair was matted with sweat and grease. Her shirt clung to her back, outlining her curves.

Nora sighed and turned away. There were more important things than looking good for a few minutes. She had a job to do.

The mess hall emptied out as the colonists left for work. Nora walked through the halls until she reached the command center.

236,0.4,0.9,1.0,73.0,4,46.0,"The halls were empty at this early hour. Nora made her way to the mess hall where she found a few others already there. The food smelled good, but she couldn't eat just yet. She needed fuel for the day's work ahead.

Nora took a seat at one of the long tables and dug into a plate of eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee. As she ate, she listened to conversations around her. Most of them were about the latest malfunction.

""I swear I'm going to find out what that thing is,"" muttered one engineer. ""It's been acting up since we got here.""

""You're telling me you've never seen anything like it?"" asked another.

Nora shook her head. She'd heard stories. But she was an engineer, not a tech specialist. She could fix a broken radio, but she didn't know how to repair a computer.

A third engineer spoke up. ""We can't afford another breakdown. We need those supplies if we want to make it through the winter.""

Nora frowned. Winter? The colony had only been here for a year. It was barely spring.

She finished her meal and left the mess hall. Outside, she stepped into the garage and retrieved her power loader from the rack. She strapped on her helmet and climbed into the driver's seat. A few minutes later, she headed out of the garage and down one of the main walkways toward the command center.

The command center was the heart of the colony. It contained offices, conference rooms, and luxury suites for Company executives. Nora bypassed the command center and went straight to the armory instead.

Her job was to repair equipment. The last time she'd been here, the armory had been locked up tight. Now it sat open with its doors wide open.

Nora walked inside. She stopped short at the sight before her. Her eyes widened, and she gasped in shock.

""What's wrong?"" asked a voice behind her.

Nora spun around to find a security guard standing there. He wore a gray uniform with a black name tag identifying him as 'Trevor'.

She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself. ""Nothing,"" she said, trying not to show her surprise. ""I thought I heard something.""

The guard nodded. He looked like he was about forty years old. His dark hair was trimmed close to his scalp, and his face was tanned from the sun. Trevor had hazel eyes and a crooked nose.

""It's just me,"" he said. ""I'm here to make sure you don't get into trouble while I'm gone.""

Nora smiled and nodded. She didn't know what else to say.

Trevor turned back toward the door, then paused. ""Don't worry too much about the drones. They're just wild animals. It's the hive things we have to be careful of. You'll see them soon enough.""

Nora followed him out of the armory and down a long corridor. The colony was laid out in an irregular hexagon, with six main walkways radiating from each corner. Nora took one of these corridors and headed straight for the command center.

The corridors were lit dimly, but she could still make out the details of her surroundings.

237,0.4,0.9,1.0,78.0,2,47.0,"The colony's power plant was located at the center of the complex, surrounded by a tall fence to keep people from wandering in. The entire structure was enclosed within a large dome supported by thick columns. A small door opened onto the concourse, where the colonists gathered for meals and recreation.

As she walked past the cafeteria, Nora saw the early risers already filling the tables with their plates. She paused to scan the crowd for familiar faces, but the dining hall was mostly empty.

There was a commotion near the front of the room. Nora followed the sound to see a group of men in uniform standing around someone who lay on the floor. She recognized one of them as her partner, Kyle.

He had been working the night shift when he got called off duty. He'd come back with a new crew member in tow.

Nora hurried over, recognizing the man on the ground from her map. She knelt beside him and felt his pulse. It was strong and steady. His breathing was calm, too.

""He's alive,"" Nora said. ""But I don't know how long.""

Kyle nodded. ""I've seen this before. They're usually unconscious for hours after they get hit. Sometimes, it takes days to wake up. We'll just have to wait and see.""

Nora looked at the other men in the room. ""What happened?""

One of them stepped forward. ""We were out on patrol last night. We heard some noises coming from a nearby cave, so we went to investigate. When we got there, we found these two guys hiding inside. One of them was injured pretty bad. The other one, he was dead. But the first guy... He was already awake when we got to him. He told us he'd been attacked by aliens. Said he saw them drag the body away.""

""Is he okay? Can you move him?"" Nora asked.

The man shook his head. ""No way. Even if he wasn't hurt, we couldn't carry him. Not with the wound he has.""

Nora glanced at Kyle. ""How is he wounded?""

Kyle shrugged. ""It looks like a big chunk of metal was ripped out of his leg. And there's something else, too.""

""What's that?""

Kyle pointed at the ground where the man lay. ""See those marks on the floor? Looks like clawed footprints. Aliens dragged him here.""

Nora frowned. ""That doesn't make sense. How could they get through our security fence?""

Kyle nodded grimly. ""They did. That's how we found them in the first place. They must have come up from underground.""

Nora turned to look at the other men. ""Did anyone hear anything before this happened?""

One of them raised a hand. ""I was on patrol duty last night. I heard some noises, but it sounded like people were fighting. So I came over to see what the commotion was about.""

""And you didn't think to call for help?"" Nora asked.

The man shook his head. ""We're not supposed to leave the colony unless we absolutely need to. There are aliens living down there, remember? We don't want to attract their attention.""

Nora looked at Kyle. ""Can he talk?""

Kyle nodded. ""He's conscious. But his leg is bad. He needs medical treatment.""

Nora stood up. ""Then let's go get him.

238,0.5,0.4,1.0,90.0,3,44.0,"The halls were empty, save for a few colonists moving slowly about their business in the dimness. A few others headed to the cafeteria at the far end of the hall. The smell of food cooking wafted from the open door.

Nora made her way down the hall, passing several doors leading to other parts of the colony. She paused outside one of these, peering inside with a frown.

The room was tiny, barely large enough for a single person to stand up straight. A young woman sat on the floor, legs folded under her and back resting against the wall. Her eyes were closed as she swayed gently back and forth.

""Nora?"" the young woman said without opening her eyes. ""It's time.""

Nora stepped into the room, closing the door behind her. She knelt down beside the girl. ""What happened? Are you okay?""

The girl opened her eyes, then smiled faintly when she saw Nora. ""I'm fine. Just tired.""

""You look like you've been up for days,"" Nora observed. ""When did you last eat?""

""A couple of hours ago. I had something to drink."" The girl looked away, embarrassed.

Nora frowned in concern. ""Let me get you some food. You're still not feeling well?""

The girl shrugged. ""Just a little dizzy. It'll pass."" She paused, looking down at her hands. ""I'm sorry. That sounded rude.""

""No, it's okay. I understand. I feel bad myself sometimes. Let me help you up.""

Nora helped the girl to her feet. The young woman leaned against Nora for support, but didn't let go. ""Thanks,"" she said softly.

Nora put an arm around the girl's shoulders and guided her toward the cafeteria. ""If you need anything else, just ask one of us. We'll be here.""

She led the girl across the hall to a room with a long table and several chairs. A few colonists sat there, eating breakfast. The smell of porridge filled the air.

Nora gestured to one of the empty seats. ""Sit down, okay? I'll get you something to eat.""

The girl was already sitting in the chair, so Nora took the seat beside her. The girl smiled shyly. ""Thanks.""

""You're welcome,"" Nora said. She picked up a bowl from the tray in front of her. ""What would you like?""

""Anything.""

Nora ladled some porridge into the girl's bowl, then topped it with berries and fresh fruit. She handed the bowl to the young woman and watched her eat. When she'd finished, Nora set about making herself something similar.

A hand touched her shoulder. ""I'll get this for you.""

Nora turned and saw another girl standing behind her. The newcomer wore a white uniform, which clung to her slender figure like a second skin. Her hair was a deep red, pulled back tightly and tied at the nape of her neck.

The girl stared at Nora with dark brown eyes. ""Hi.""

""Hello,"" Nora said uncertainly.

239,0.5,0.4,1.0,75.0,5,45.0,"The hallways were empty, but the smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. Nora hurried toward the cafeteria, eager to get something hot in her belly.

The colonists ate their meals at long tables set up around a large central area. The colony's dining halls were designed to be both functional and comfortable. The ceiling was high enough to accommodate the tallest people, so it didn't feel cramped. A few tall trees stood here and there, providing shade from the harsh sun on this barren planet.

As Nora walked down the corridor, she saw that the cafeteria was already bustling with activity. She passed several groups of colonists sitting together at their tables, and the chatter of conversation surrounded her.

""You guys sure are early,"" Nora heard one woman say to another. ""It's barely morning.""

""We're just getting started,"" the second woman replied. ""Don't you remember? This is our first day off in over a week.""

Nora turned toward the voice and stopped short, staring in awe at the stunningly beautiful young woman standing beside her. She wore an emerald green jacket with blue accents, and her dark hair was pulled back into a ponytail. Nora gasped in surprise.

""I'm sorry! I didn't mean to stare,"" Nora said, more breathless than usual. Her gaze dropped to the ground and her face flushed red with embarrassment.

The other woman smiled. ""No worries. It's nice of you to notice. So, what do you think?""

Nora blushed even brighter. ""About... you?"" she managed to ask.

""Yes, about me, of course!"" The woman laughed. ""How did you know?""

""Well..."" Nora began, but the woman cut her off.

""Come on, don't be shy. Don't let this place get to you. You'll have plenty of time for that later.""

""I guess so,"" Nora said, trying not to sound like a teenage girl who'd been caught gawking at her crush. ""You look really pretty, though.""

""Thanks. I try my best,"" the woman replied with a coy smile.

Nora grinned in return, feeling awkward and embarrassed. She looked away, but the woman's eyes followed her. The young woman seemed to see right through her.

""What are you doing here? I thought your shift started at eight,"" Nora asked.

The woman shrugged. ""Company policy says we're allowed one day off a week. They've never had anyone complain before.""

""Oh, right. Well, it's nice to meet you,"" Nora said awkwardly. ""I'm Nora Decker.""

""Nice to meet you too, Nora. I'm Kelly."" The woman extended her hand, which Nora shook gingerly.

Kelly smiled amiably and turned back to the table where several other colonists sat around an empty space. Nora looked back down the hallway and saw a few people walking toward them.

""Hey, Kelly,"" one of those men called out. ""We were going to grab breakfast together. You coming?""

240,0.5,0.4,1.0,75.0,5,48.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few small, green-glowing lights in the walls. She walked along the narrow hallways, past rows of identical doors, until she reached the end of the hallway where a wide door awaited her. The large portal was made from heavy, bright blue plastic. It was the only color in the entire colony.

Nora paused as she approached the door and glanced around nervously. She wasn't sure if anyone else was awake yet, but whatever was inside this room held the power to make her life hell.

She raised one hand to knock on the door, then hesitated when she heard voices coming from within. She leaned closer, trying to hear what they were saying.

""I don't see the harm,"" said a man's voice. ""If we're going to be stuck here for years, why not take the opportunity to make the best of it? We'll get paid whether or not I do my job.""

A woman replied, ""But you know how long it takes to set up and operate that thing. You have to maintain it, service it, rewire it every time something breaks down... And if we didn't need it, the Company wouldn't send us out here in the first place. They'd just hire someone who could fix things properly!""

The men laughed, and Nora pressed her ear even harder against the door.

""The Company doesn't give a shit about us. All they care about is making money. If we screw up their equipment, so what? It's not like our lives are in danger or anything.""

Nora frowned at the door, trying to make sense of what she was hearing. The two voices sounded familiar, but she couldn't quite place them.

""You sound like a real piece of work,"" said the man's voice. ""What happened to being a team player? We can't let ourselves get caught up in petty disputes.""

""I'm not part of your'petty dispute'. I want to go home. It's been three months since we arrived. Three months! I've heard nothing from my family. No word, no message. Nothing!""

Nora bit her lip. She recognized that woman's voice. Nora knew the woman and her husband, John, because he worked in the garage. He was good with his hands and had a knack for fixing things. But Nora also remembered him yelling at her when they were both young, before they'd gotten married.

""And what would you do if we went back?"" the woman asked angrily. ""We don't have any money left to send home. What would happen to our families then? You're not a real engineer, just some kid who got lucky and ended up working here.""

""I'll be an engineer someday. And I'll get paid whether or not I finish my training,"" the man replied. ""It's better than sitting around here, doing nothing.""

Nora shifted uncomfortably. The couple sounded like they'd been arguing for years. Her parents hadn't argued in front of her when she was growing up, so it made her uncomfortable to hear them fight now. It wasn't the first time she'd heard the two of them argue.

The door opened abruptly, startling Nora. A tall, dark-skinned man stood framed in the doorway.

241,0.5,0.4,1.0,79.0,4,47.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty, but at least the colonists weren't up yet. They'd be finishing their morning meal soon.

At the end of each hallway, a communal shower waited. Smaller than the ones back home, these showers were utilitarian and functional. The water was hot, plentiful, and free of soap. There wasn't even a curtain to block the view. But the showerheads located in the corners were too high for comfort, so Nora tended to step inside while facing away from the other people waiting.

As she washed the grime off her body, Nora thought about the day ahead. She ran her hand through her short hair, raking fingers through matted locks to comb it out.

Nora's eyes narrowed as she finished washing herself. Someone had left the door open behind them! That wasn't allowed. And what was that smell?

She turned toward the sound of running water and froze. In the corner of her eye, she glimpsed something move—a dark shape ducking out of sight.

""Aliens,"" Nora said aloud. ""I'm not alone."" She dropped her towel and rushed into the hallway, scrambling for a weapon. Then she stopped.

A moment later, she realized why she hadn't seen anything moving in the corner of her vision. The room was empty.

Nora stood stock still in the middle of the hall, staring at the doorway. Her heart pounded. Was there an enemy in here with her? If so, where could it be hiding?

No movement came from the shadows. Had she imagined it? No, she was sure. A cold shiver ran down her spine.

Nora took a deep breath and tried to calm herself. She picked up her towel again and dried off, then started walking back toward the dormitory. The corridor was clear now, but she didn't relax.

She passed the communal showers and continued on to the cafeteria. As she walked, she scanned the area for any sign of danger.

The cafeteria was at the end of the hallway. It was wide open, with a long counter along one wall. At the other side, a line stretched out the door, filled with colonists waiting for breakfast.

Nora stepped inside the cafeteria. The air was warm and damp from the showerheads overhead. She surveyed the room. There were no aliens here, but she couldn't tell if that was good or bad. On the far side of the room, an elderly man sat at a table. He wore his usual suit and tie, despite the fact he'd been awake since before dawn. His hair was gray and slicked back, revealing a bald spot on top.

Nora approached him and leaned down to speak into his ear. ""Are you okay?"" she asked.

He looked up, startled, then nodded and smiled. ""Yes, my dear. I'm fine.""

""You don't look fine,"" Nora said.

242,0.5,0.4,1.0,69.0,6,45.0,"The hallways were empty except for a few colonists wandering aimlessly along their paths. They looked like lost children, trudging through the dim halls in a daze.

Nora found Sully at the mess hall already, eating breakfast. He wore a thick sweatshirt over his coveralls and held a mug of steaming coffee in one hand. The clatter of his fork on the plastic plate echoed loudly across the table.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said without looking up from the food. ""You're late.""

""I'm sorry. I overslept.""

Sully nodded absently, chewing. Nora ate silently, trying not to notice how much they resembled each other. She wondered if it was some kind of genetic quirk, something that happened when two people grew close enough to share the same genes.

She pushed aside her own breakfast and took a seat at the opposite end of the table.

The cafeteria tables were long and narrow, each covered in a thin layer of grime. The walls were plastered with advertisements for various products, and the ceiling was lit by bare bulbs. A few other colonists sat in the room, but most of the seats remained empty.

Nora stared at her tray. Breakfast consisted of a bowl of cereal and an egg substitute. She had no appetite, but she forced herself to eat.

Afterward, Nora walked back down the hallway toward her quarters. As she passed one of the colonists, she glanced in its direction and saw it staring at her.

It wasn't a person. It was a drone... or so it appeared until Nora looked closer. The drone's face was smooth, featureless black metal. Its body was encased in a flexible carapace that allowed it to move like a human being.

The drone stood motionless, examining her with wide eyes and a blank expression.

Nora shivered and hurried past. She found the dormitories empty, save for a few colonists who slept in their beds. The lights were still off.

She entered her room and shut the door behind her. A faint chill lingered in the air, but Nora didn't notice it. Her thoughts were elsewhere.

Sully had been right about one thing. She was late.

Nora went to work on the malfunctioning computer. After a few minutes, she decided to get some fresh air. The colony was built into the cliffside, which meant every building faced the open desert.

The sun had barely risen, but already it beat down upon Nora's head. She squinted at the sky and turned her face up toward the warming rays. The heat made her sweat, but she felt better for it.

She walked around the colony, trying not to think too much about what was waiting out there.

The colony huddled in a warren of corridors and chambers.

243,0.5,0.4,1.0,77.0,4,43.0,"The colony's dormitory hallways were empty and quiet. The colonists would be in the cafeteria, already eating their morning meal. There was no need to hurry.

Nora walked briskly through the corridors, but found herself slowing as she passed each door. She paused at every one, peering inside. They were empty. No one else was awake yet. All of the rooms were dark and silent.

She stopped outside her own room. It was a small single with a foldout bed. A few clothes hung from hooks on the wall, including her uniform. Nora touched her lips to the cold metal frame. She breathed out, then pressed her hand flat against it.

A faint whisper of sound came from the other side of the thin partition. Nora shivered. Her heart thumped in her chest and sweat prickled on her skin. She took a deep breath, held it, and slowly exhaled.

Nora stared at the door for a moment longer. Then she turned and left.

The cafeteria was brightly lit and filled with people. Everyone sat around long tables in rows, chatting or hunched over books. People smiled and waved as Nora entered the room. The din of conversation rose to meet her, filling the space.

Nora headed straight for the food line where she grabbed a tray with two steaming platters. She scanned the crowd until she spotted her roommate, Dee. She was sitting at a table near the window with her back to the room and her face hidden behind a book.

Dee was a tall, slender woman with cropped brown hair and black eyes. She wore a sleeveless shirt and an open vest with frayed cuffs above her pants.

Nora pushed through the throng of colonists toward their table.

""Hey,"" she said to Dee. ""How's it going?""

""Good."" Dee folded up her book and set it aside, then stood.

Nora saw Dee was wearing a pair of loose cotton trousers and a short-sleeved shirt. She was barefoot.

They hugged each other briefly. Nora glanced around the room, but no one else had noticed them yet. Nora pulled away after a moment and looked at her roommate.

""So what are you reading?""

Dee shrugged. ""I've been trying to get into this new series, but I keep getting distracted by something on my mind.""

Nora nodded. Dee was a loner. She didn't have many friends here. Nora suspected she was just too shy to make any.

""What's wrong? You look pale,"" Nora said.

Dee looked down at her feet. ""It's nothing,"" she murmured, then turned away.

Nora watched her for a minute before saying anything more.

""Are you sure?"" she asked. ""We're roommates. We should talk about it.""

Dee gave a small shrug and started walking. She picked up her tray and walked out of the cafeteria without looking back.

Nora followed. She stepped outside onto the flat, barren grounds surrounding the colony. The wind whipped off the cliff faces and ruffled her hair. Nora took a deep breath.

She had been a little worried about Dee earlier, but now she was glad she'd brought her along.

The colonists were all busy with their work.

244,0.5,0.4,1.0,72.0,5,47.0,"The corridors were still dark, but the walls glowed faintly once she passed under the lights at each end of the hall. The air smelled of dust and mildew. Her boots echoed as she walked, making her ears ring.

Ahead was a door marked'Staff Only'. Nora hesitated for a moment, then turned the handle and slipped inside. She found herself in a small room that resembled a janitor's closet. A row of lockers lined one wall, while shelves filled with cleaning supplies stood along the opposite side.

Nora opened the first locker and got her work clothes out to start dressing. She put on a set of coveralls over her coat, and pulled on sturdy boots with thick soles that could withstand the weight of heavy machinery. As her eyes adjusted to the dimness, she saw an assortment of tools hanging from hooks on the upper shelf.

She grabbed a few of them and headed back out into the corridor. The doors to the dormitories were closed, but Nora knew she'd find a way in. She had no choice.

The hallway was empty when she left the staff area, but she heard voices coming from somewhere down the hall. It sounded like there were two people talking, though Nora couldn't make out what they were saying.

She crept forward until she reached the next intersection, then peeked around the door frame. The corridor was dark, and she peered through the gloom at a group of five colonists standing together in front of a large window. They appeared to be discussing something, but Nora couldn't hear their voices above the low hum of the colony's main power plant.

Nora stepped out of the shadows and approached. 'Excuse me,' she said. 'I'm sorry to bother you folks, but I need to get some breakfast.'The colonists turned toward her with surprise. One of them spoke up, sounding irritated. 'What are we supposed to do about it?'

'Well...' Nora hesitated, wondering if she should tell them the truth. She wasn't sure how much trouble she would cause for being here so early. But the situation was urgent. She needed food now, or she'd die.

She cleared her throat and tried again. 'There's a malfunction in the kitchen, and my shift starts soon. Can you help me?''You're an engineer?' asked one of the men. He had a deep voice and a gruff demeanor. His hair was darkly tousled, and he wore a thick leather jacket over his coveralls.

Nora nodded. 'Yes, sir. My name is Nora Decker. I work in the engineering section of the colony. Do any of you have experience repairing equipment?'

The man looked back at the others, who were standing behind him. They seemed to be waiting for a decision. Finally, he spoke up.

Nora smiled wryly and wished they weren't. She'd rather be alone than share the small space with others. But it was only one more day.

She made her way to the mess hall, passing several other colonists on their way to breakfast. They greeted her politely, nodding or smiling, but didn't linger. As Nora approached the cafeteria, a tall man with dark hair stood outside waiting for her. He wore a black uniform with gold piping along the shoulders and sleeves.

""Good morning, Ms. Decker,"" he said, bowing slightly.

Nora stopped short. ""Oh... uh..."" She glanced down at her faded, stained clothes. ""Sorry about that. I was just—""

The man crossed his arms and arched a brow. ""You should wear something more presentable.""

Nora cringed internally. That's what she gets for being late.

""I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting anyone up this early. I'll get changed right now. Do you want me to bring breakfast?""

The man shook his head. ""No need, Ms. Decker. You're welcome to join us if you like. We've been waiting for your arrival.""

Nora looked at him uncertainly. She didn't know the man, but he had an unnerving air of authority and confidence that made her uneasy. It was hard to tell from the outside whether he was handsome or ugly. His face was angular and lean, with a sharp nose, narrow lips, and dark eyes. Nora couldn't read his expression through his mask of black hair.

""Um... okay,"" she said. ""Thanks for asking. I'll be there in a minute.""

Nora turned away from the man and walked into the mess hall. The tables were already full, so she took a seat at a corner where she could watch the door.

She waited until everyone was done eating before joining them. As she sat, a young woman with dark hair and green eyes approached her table. ""Hi! My name is Lyla. I'm one of the techs here. Are you new?""

""Yeah, I just started today.""

Lyla smiled. ""Welcome to the colony!""

Nora nodded politely. ""Thank you.""

There was no way to tell if Lyla was attractive or not. Her features were unremarkable. She wore blue coveralls with a white shirt beneath, but the fabric was thin enough to show her flat stomach and muscular arms. Nora noticed that she had a tattoo on her left arm.

""So what do you think of Presley's Promise?"" Lyla asked, gesturing around the room. ""It's a pretty cool place, huh? I've only been here for two weeks.""

Nora shrugged. ""I like it. The people are nice. They take care of each other. It makes me feel safe.""

246,0.5,0.4,1.0,91.0,4,46.0,"She headed straight for the mess hall where she could get some food.

The corridors were cold, the air damp and chill as she passed through them. The sounds of colonists eating echoed off the walls, and a few glanced up at her in passing.

Nora's face tightened as she remembered what happened last time she was late. She tried to push those memories away, but they returned anyway.

It was the same thing every morning. Her first day on the job, she made it to the cafeteria just after the breakfast rush, only to find that someone else had beaten her there.

But this time, Nora was determined not to let it happen again. She pushed open the door and walked inside with purposeful steps, scanning the room for familiar faces.

The kitchen area was dimly lit, the overhead lights flickering on as the cook turned on the main power supply. As Nora entered, he looked up from his work and nodded in greeting.

He was a young man with dark hair, bushy eyebrows, and bright blue eyes. He wore a white chef's coat over a plaid button-up shirt and black trousers. A long knife hung from one belt loop. The other held a spatula and a large mixing bowl.

""Hey, I'm sorry I'm late."" Nora smiled at the cook. ""I didn't realize it would be so crowded this early in the morning. Can you start without me?""

The cook raised an eyebrow as he continued stirring something in the big bowl. ""You're always late, Nora. You know that.""

Nora shrugged. ""It's my shift. I have to get ready for it.""

The cook sent her a look of exasperation. ""Well, if you can't do your job, then maybe we should let someone else handle the food. They'll be here soon anyway. But they won't like that.""

""I'll make it up to them,"" Nora said. She glanced around the kitchen area. The cook was right. There were several colonists already in line at the buffet table, waiting for their turn. They looked tired and worn.

""Let me go first,"" Nora offered.

The cook turned back to his cooking. ""No, Nora. I'll wait until everyone is served before I start.""

Nora sighed. ""Fine. Just tell me when you need me.""

She walked over to the end of the buffet and started filling her plate. As usual, Nora was hungry. The colonists had been rationing food supplies ever since the Company lost contact with Earth years ago. Their supplies were running low, but there was no way to get more without leaving the planet.

Nora took a deep breath as she reached for her first selection. She knew better than to just pick something at random. If the Colony Council wanted her to help fix the equipment, they would have assigned someone else.

There was nothing wrong with her skills or abilities that couldn't be fixed with some time and effort. But Nora wasn't interested in playing nursemaid to the colonists anymore. She was on her own now, and she needed to look out for herself.

247,0.5,0.4,1.0,90.0,5,44.0,"The dormitory hallways were filled with colonists in various stages of dress. The halls smelled of sweat, dust, and stale air. Nora's boots clomped loudly over the metallic grating covering the flooring.

Nora passed a few people in the halls, but most of them were focused on their own business. She caught glimpses of other workers going about their day.

At the end of the hallway, Nora stopped at a door marked 'Dining Hall'. She fished her key card from her pocket and swiped it through the reader beside the door. A soft beep sounded, and the door slid open with a hiss of escaping air.

The dining hall was large and circular, with a raised stage in the center. Tables lined both sides of the room. In the far corner, there was a row of vending machines. The tables were covered in plastic sheets and had been set up for breakfasts.

Nora walked down the aisle between two rows of tables and sat at one that looked relatively empty. She pulled off her jacket, folded it carefully, and placed it on the table in front of her.

The table was made of brushed metal, with a black surface that reflected the light from the overhead lamps. The chairs were bolted to the floor and were built of the same material. Nora's chair creaked under the strain as she settled into it.

She glanced around at the other diners. Most were already eating, but a few others lingered over their plates. Nora took a deep breath and tried not to let her nerves get the better of her.

The lights dimmed and a chime sounded. A holographic menu appeared in the air above Nora's head. She tapped it and waited while the machine scanned the contents of her meal order.

""Breakfast is served,"" the machine announced. ""Your selections are... bacon, eggs over easy, toast with butter and jam, or fruit.""

Nora smiled. She'd eaten this exact breakfast many times before. It was always a favorite. She ordered the bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast, plus some juice and coffee.

A few seconds later, the food arrived on white dishes. Nora picked up her fork, wondering if she should eat today. She hadn't had much sleep last night. But she wasn't about to pass up a good breakfast for that reason.

She dug in, savoring the rich taste of the bacon and sweet, runny yolks. The toast was crisp and hot. Nora took a sip of orange juice.

Her eyes widened as she stared down at her plate. Her mouth hung open in shock.

The bacon was gone.

Nora's heart pounded and her breath came faster. She stared down at the empty dish with a numb expression on her face.

It couldn't be.

248,0.5,0.5,1.0,95.0,5,45.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty as she passed them by, each one lined on either side with doors. The hallway led to the communal dining area where colonists ate outside of their shifts. At this early hour, the cafeteria was mostly dark except for a few dim lights along the walls and a small fire pit in the center.

Nora walked through the dining area to the kitchen, where an older woman was busy preparing breakfast. She wore a long gray smock dress that buttoned up the front, which Nora recognized as a lab coat.

""Good morning,"" the woman said. ""I'm Dr. Turen. I'll be your supervisor today.""

Nora nodded. ""Morning, Doctor.""

Turen looked over at the table. ""You can call me Vella. You're Nora Decker, right?""

""Yes ma'am. That's my name.""

""Well, welcome aboard the colony. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. Get started on your tasks."" She gestured toward the line. ""Get something to eat, then we'll start you on the day's schedule. There's an assembly point for those who need to get to the command center. Let's see how you do. If it doesn't meet our standards, I'll find someone else to take your place.""

Nora nodded. ""Yes, ma'am. Thank you.""

She walked down the line, picking up a tray and a mug of steaming coffee. The smell alone made her mouth water. She bit into a piece of bread slathered with jam and took a hot sip of the bitter liquid. It was delicious, but she didn't have time for breakfast. After chewing and swallowing, Nora set the cup on the tray and grabbed the first file folder in the stack.

The work required to keep the colony running was complex. Most colonists were engineers or scientists, so Nora had been assigned to maintenance. This included fixing equipment that failed, keeping the power plant operational, cleaning the greenhouses, and performing other routine tasks.

Nora opened the file and skimmed the contents as she headed for the door. Her list of tasks wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but before leaving, she paused at the kitchen sink to wash her hands and face. She hated the thought of spending her shift scrubbing pots and pans, but it would be a necessary chore.

On the way back to the dormitory, Nora passed by the assembly point. A sign on the wall read, ""Attendance is mandatory."" The line stretched down the corridor.

Nora glanced up at the clock. She still had fifteen minutes until her shift started. She could stand around and wait for someone else, but she didn't want to miss the start of her shift because she'd wasted time standing in line.

Nora climbed the stairs to the top floor where the command center was located. A hand-lettered sign on the front door said, ""Command Center. Enter at your own risk.""

Nora walked through the doors into a small lobby with an elevator shaft. The walls were bare metal, and the ceiling had no lights.

249,0.5,0.5,1.0,82.0,5,47.0,"The corridors were empty, so she took the stairs instead of the lift. The first set of doors opened onto the central courtyard where colonists gathered for meals. There was no one in sight, though Nora heard voices from the mess hall.

She paused at the door, turning back to check her appearance in a mirror mounted on the wall. She ran both hands through her hair to straighten it and smooth down her unruly bangs. Her eyebrows furrowed when she saw herself for a moment, then relaxed again.

Nora walked into the dining area. A few of the tables were occupied, but most were empty. For now, there was nothing to do but wait until the others arrived.

As Nora sat, her eyes fell upon the table behind her. A small pile of clothes had been placed beside the chair, neatly folded. She looked over her shoulder, startled at the discovery.

The room was silent. Nora turned back around, confused. Someone must have left these here while she slept.

A faint scratching noise drew her attention. She stood and faced the door leading out of the mess hall. But it wasn't a scratch—it sounded like someone running their fingers along the doorframe.

Nora stepped back from the doorway. Was something trying to get in?

She held her breath, listening for any sign of movement. The hallway remained still and quiet. Nora's heart rate quickened. She was alone.

The sound came again. It was definitely coming from outside the building!

Nora ran toward the door but stopped when she spotted the shiny metal object on the floor near the doorway. A tiny red light flashed in the corner of her eye, making her jump.

Nora crouched down and picked up the device. She turned it over in her hands before recognizing it as a flashlight.

She clicked the button and its beam of white light filled the hall with bright beams of light.

The dancing lights made Nora's skin crawl, but she didn't hesitate to use the device to explore the rest of the colony.

The hallways were empty; the only sounds came from her footsteps echoing off the walls. She passed through several rooms and found them deserted. The colonists weren't here. They must be out exploring.

She thought about going back to bed, but the idea of returning to her warm bed without any company or companionship was too daunting.

Nora continued on until she reached an intersection where two corridors met. She paused, looking both ways before stepping into the dark corridor. The air was dry and cold. Nora shivered.

The hallway curved away from her, so she turned to follow it. As she walked, the light from the device began to fade. She shone it on the wall, but there wasn't enough light for her to see much of anything.

250,0.5,0.5,1.0,82.0,3,47.0,"The dormitory halls were filled with snoring colonists, many of whom seemed to be sleeping in their clothes. Not so Nora. Her mind stayed alert as she navigated the hallways, trying not to step on anyone's toes.

A few steps later, Nora reached the cafeteria. The dining room was small but well-appointed, with dark wood tables and chairs. A long counter lined one wall behind a row of cook stations. Though the lighting was dim, it did little to hide the food prep areas.

Nora paused at the entrance to the room, taking in the scene. She scanned for her friends but couldn't spot them. Then she noticed someone sitting alone at a table near the back corner.

""Hello, there,"" Nora said. ""Mind if I sit?""

The young woman looked up from her meal. She was a chunky, blonde girl with bright green eyes and a friendly smile.

""I'm sorry, but we're full,"" the girl said.

Nora shook her head. ""It'll only take a minute.""

The girl stood as Nora approached the counter, then moved to the side. She gestured for Nora to sit.

""What's your name?"" Nora asked with a nod toward the girl.

""Lilith. Lilith Carter. What can I get you?""

""Wow, a real name! That's so cool. Where are you from?""

Lilith smiled and tilted her head to one side. ""Oh, just here and there. My parents were colonists, too. You wouldn't know it though, since they died when I was very young.""

""That... must've been tough,"" Nora said.

""Yeah. It wasn't easy growing up without them, but my grandparents raised me until I could join the colony.""

Nora nodded sympathetically. ""Do you have any family left?""

""No. Not really. Just some distant cousins who live on Earth.""

She paused, and Nora wondered if the girl was thinking about her own situation. ""How'd you end up here? I mean, why did your parents settle down out here instead of somewhere else?""

""Well,"" Lilith said with a shrug. Her expression turned serious. ""They wanted to be pioneers. They didn't want to go back to Earth after the war.""

Nora watched Lilith closely as she spoke. The girl seemed open and honest, which made her even more appealing than most people Nora knew.

""So you were born here?"" Nora asked.

""I think so. Yeah.""

""Where are your parents buried?""

Lilith hesitated, then shook her head. ""Not yet.""

""You don't have a grave marker or anything like that?""

The girl shrugged again. ""We haven't had time to get one put up.""

""That's okay,"" Nora said. ""It's not important.""

Lilith looked at her, surprised. ""Really?""

Nora nodded. ""Sure.""

The girl frowned. ""But... how can you say it's not important?""

""Because I'm going to die soon anyway. And if I do, there'll be no marker for me anywhere. Nothing but dust and rocks.""

251,0.5,0.5,1.0,86.0,4,42.0,"The hallway outside her room was dimly lit by glowing panels mounted along the walls. The lights were brighter than the day before, but the uneven illumination failed to dispel the gloom. The air smelled stale, like dust and ozone. No one was in sight except her.

She made a beeline for the communal kitchen at the end of the hall. She'd just gotten to the doorway when the alarm sounded again, this time louder. Nora paused, hovering uncertainly.

The Colony's alarms could only be triggered by certain types of emergencies or if there was real danger to the colony. The intensity of the sound sent a chill up her spine, because it meant that something had gone wrong.

Nora hurried down the corridor, trying to imagine what could have happened. She considered the possibilities one after another as she walked. A fire? Something mechanical malfunctioning? Aliens attacking?

No, aliens wouldn't attack the colony. They didn't need to. If they wanted the colonists dead, they would simply kill them.

The alarm stopped abruptly. The silence was deafening. Nora stood in the middle of the hallway, blinking. Her heart pounded. Her hands shook.

Then the alarm started up again, this time with a different tone and pattern. It was a signal for everyone to gather in the command center.

Nora ran down the hall, her boots clanking on the metal floor. She reached the main concourse just in time to see the doors slide open. Everyone inside rushed out. Nora followed the others into the large, enclosed space.

Everyone was there except for one person.

Bobbie!

Nora's pulse quickened. Where was Bobbie? She scanned the faces of the people gathered around the central concourse, but she couldn't find her friend anywhere.

""What happened?"" Nora demanded. ""Where is Bobbie?""

The crowd parted to let two men through the door. They were both big, muscular guys wearing coveralls. Both had dark hair and brown eyes. One was tall; the other short.

The taller man spoke. His voice was low and gravelly, like he'd been smoking or drinking too much lately. ""We just lost our engineer.""

Nora's stomach bottomed out at the news. She could feel her knees start to shake. Her vision blurred.

Bobbie was dead? How did they lose Bobbie?

Nora clutched the edge of a table, trying to hold herself together. She felt like she was going to vomit. The thought made her sick and achy inside.

A hand touched Nora's shoulder, startling her. Sully Carmichael stood next to her with an apologetic look. He held out his arm in support.

Nora took it gratefully, letting him lead her away from the group. She leaned against him, grateful for the physical contact.

""I'm so sorry,"" Sully said. ""That must have been awful for you.""

She nodded mutely.

Sully squeezed her elbow. ""You're a good friend to Bobbie. We'll find out what happened. You can count on us.""

252,0.5,0.5,1.0,76.0,7,44.0,"Nora left the dormitory wing and passed through the colony's main entrance hall. The hall was empty except for a few colonists making their way to breakfast. She paused at the edge of the hall, looking around with interest. This was her first time outside the colony's walls.

Colonists were a diverse bunch. They came from every corner of the human galaxy, young and old, male and female, rich and poor. Their uniforms ranged from the traditional uniform of the Company – dark gray coveralls with orange piping on the shoulders and sleeves, a blue company logo embroidered over the right breast pocket, and a pocket square in the same color – to more exotic outfits like Nora's own.

Nora wore her work clothes: a loose-fitting synthetic fabric shirt, utilitarian pants, and sturdy boots. She carried a small tool bag on one shoulder and a pistol holstered under her arm. Her hair was tied back with a bandanna.

She looked around, feeling the breeze on her face and smelling the dust in the air. Nora breathed deep, letting it fill her lungs. She felt the grit of dirt against her skin, tasted the bitter tang of the wind, and savored the faint hint of ozone from the fusion plant.

The world was still quiet. The only sound was the rustle of the leaves in the trees that lined the walkway to the main gate and the occasional clop of a hoof as a horse or mule plodded along. Nora glanced at the ground, looking for signs of recent activity by the colony's guards. She saw them occasionally, patrolling through the grounds as they checked their weapons and armor, but there weren't any fresh tracks.

Nora walked out into the morning light.

The sun had barely risen above the horizon when she reached the main gate. It stood open, allowing her to pass through without hindrance. Nora stepped past the guards and onto the road beyond.

Presley's Promise was a small town in the middle of nowhere. The group of buildings clustered around the center of the colony were surrounded on three sides by an expanse of grassland dotted with trees. At the edge of the forest, Nora could see the distant mountain range rising up behind the colony. A few wisps of dust hung in the air here and there, marking the path of a passing patrol or the passage of an exploratory team.

The colonists'commute was short. They lived within walking distance of their workstations. Nora passed a handful of other workers making their way toward the main gate, but most of them headed off to breakfast. She'd eaten before leaving for her shift.

Nora walked down the main pathway that connected the dormitory wing and the command center. As she approached the main entrance hall, she heard voices coming from inside.

""... You don't need to worry about it,"" Nora said as she entered the assembly room. ""I'm not going out today.""

253,0.5,0.5,1.0,81.0,6,43.0,"The hallways were crowded. People got up early for work. The air smelled like sweat, flour, and coffee. Nora passed a few colonists going in the opposite direction. One of them gave her a nod, but the other two just scowled at her as she went past.

The colony's cafeteria was packed. There were people everywhere, eating, talking, reading, playing games on tablet computers, and enjoying the occasional snack. Nora took a seat near the back of the room. She ordered something to eat and sat staring at her food until it arrived.

After a long meal, she washed down her third cup of coffee with a swig of water from her canteen. She left the table with her head held high and marched off to report for duty.

Nora walked through corridors that stank of stale sweat and machine oil. Her eyes darted around nervously. As she neared the command center, she paused outside the doors and tried to calm her pounding heart.

The door slid open and Nora stepped inside. She felt exposed in the small conference room. The dark paneled walls seemed too close, and the ceiling was low. A large window overlooked a rocky landscape. While she waited for the elevator to arrive, Nora stared out the window into the misty morning.

The elevator arrived, and Nora rode it up one floor. From there she followed the corridor to a wide set of double doors. She pushed them open and entered the command center.

Inside, the air was cool and dry with the scent of electronics and dust. Nora breathed in deeply, trying to clear her head. She hurried across a cluttered space to the main comm station at the front of the room.

The controller's chair stood before the console. It looked like a throne made from cast iron and leather. The seat had arms and a backrest that curved into a horseshoe shape. An ornate crown sat atop the head rest, and the entire seat was topped with an intricate pattern of metal plating.

Nora sat in the chair, adjusted it until she was comfortable, and strapped herself in. She pulled on the headset while she waited for her terminal to boot. The screen flickered into life, displaying a company logo.

""Good morning,"" said a pleasant female voice. ""Please enter your security code.""

Nora punched in the combination. She didn't recognize the voice and felt a twinge of worry.

""Thank you. Please wait while the system verifies your identity.""

A red light shone above the keyboard, signaling the computer had successfully authenticated her. Nora relaxed and took a deep breath.

The light turned green. She entered the password again. The console hummed to itself for a moment, then glowed with a dim blue light. A small monitor on the console lit up and displayed a string of characters. As the display filled in, it became a bright purple. The letters spelled out the name of the Company's artificial intelligence, Eve.

Eve flashed another series of characters on the screen. Nora typed in a response and waited for the machine to confirm it.

""Welcome, Nora Decker,"" said Eve. ""I am pleased to see that you are awake this early.""

""Good morning, Nora. Did you sleep well?""

She nodded. ""I did."" She glanced around the room. ""Where is everyone?""

Sully pointed toward the door. ""They're already out. They'll be in the garage for the day, working on the power loaders. You can go eat if you want. Or you can take a shower first.""

Nora wrinkled her nose and grinned. ""Shower sounds good. I'll just grab something quick to eat while they work."" She headed back down the hall toward the common showers, making sure to keep her steps brisk and purposeful.

The halls were quiet as she walked through them. The colonists had been up early this morning; the dormitories were half full, but most of the other rooms in the colony were empty. Nora went straight to a communal shower at the end of the hall and stripped off her clothes.

The shower was a single stall with an oval opening that could fit two people side by side. A wide ring of faucets surrounded the drain, so there was no need for soap or shampoo. Nora turned on the water and stepped inside the shower.

She washed quickly, rinsing away the grime from her face and hair. Water ran over her bare body, cooling the heat that radiated from her skin. She rubbed herself down with a bar of soap, then toweled dry before stepping out into the room.

Nora pulled on her pants and shirt again, and tucked the towel under one arm. She left the bathroom, walking down the hall and passing the open door to Sully's office.

""You're going to get cold,"" she said. ""I'll be right back.""

Sully looked up as she passed his door, smiling. ""Good morning, Nora.""

""Morning,"" she replied.

He gestured toward the door. ""Go ahead. I'll be here when you come back out.""

Nora nodded and went down the hall to a cafeteria area where a line of tables held food and drink. The colonists were already there, chattering among themselves in low voices. She went straight for the last table, which was free.

She sat at the table and laid her towel on top of it, then dug into a bowl of cereal while people shuffled past her. She ate quickly, washing down the granola with a tall glass of water.

When she finished eating, Nora put her dishes on the tray and headed back to the showers. She stepped inside, closing the door behind her.

The shower stall was big enough that she could lie down flat without getting her feet wet. Nora turned the faucets to warm water, then let them run until the temperature dropped below the safe level for skin contact. Then she turned off the flow again and stood there naked, letting the hot water wash over her.

Nora closed her eyes and breathed slowly. She tried not to think about the aliens lurking somewhere nearby, or what she'd do if they attacked. Her mind kept drifting back to her nightmares.

The communal dining hall was also emptier than usual, but Nora made her way there anyway. She sat at one of the tables, picked up a spoon, and dug in to the eggs and bacon she'd saved for herself.

As she ate, Nora tried not to think about the alien hive that had been stalking her colony only three days ago.

The Company hadn't said anything about it. They probably didn't know about it yet either. But the drones had killed more people. Nora wondered if they knew how many.

She forced her mind to focus on the food. She was hungry but she needed fuel for her muscles. Nora finished every bite, then wiped her hands on a napkin and stood.

Nora hopped over the table and grabbed her jacket from a chair before heading out of the dining hall. She passed several colonists on their way back to work, none of whom acknowledged her presence. Nora gave them a polite nod and walked briskly toward the power plant with her head down.

The power plant was a large structure housing multiple generators, batteries, and a massive water tank. Nora's job as an engineer wasn't just to fix equipment; she also maintained the arsenal of energy weapons used to defend the colony. She headed for the engineering bay, where she would start her morning shift.

The engineering bay held two rows of tool racks filled with diagnostic tools and other repair supplies. Nora pulled a wrench from its rack and started working to loosen bolts on a broken generator. The generator hummed as it produced electricity, which flowed through the cables attached to each generator.

Nora worked steadily for five minutes, and then she heard a muted thump behind her. She didn't look up, but instead continued to work on the generator.

Two figures stepped into view. A man and woman. They were dressed in black, and Nora recognized them at once. She let out a gasp of surprise.

""Morning,"" the man said, moving toward her with purposeful strides. He wore a dark shirt and pants. His hair was short and shaggy, and his eyes were pale blue.

Nora felt her heart race. ""Sully?""

The man nodded. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Her throat tightened. She tried to swallow, but couldn't. Sully looked different now than he had when she'd seen him last. He was leaner and harder. His face held a strong jawline and a sharp nose.

He stopped next to her work station, then reached out and touched Nora's shoulder. Her mind flashed back to the time he'd saved her from the aliens.

She swallowed hard again, but this time she managed it. She turned around and met his gaze. ""What are you doing here?""

His eyes bore into hers. ""You're not going to be able to hide anything from me, Nora. I'm your boss.""

""I don't work for you anymore. You fired me!""

""That may have been what the Company wanted, but no one forced you to stay there. You could have quit anytime. But instead, you stayed on. Why?""

""Because I owe you my life,"" Nora said. ""And because I want to help people.""

Sully smiled thinly.

256,0.5,0.5,1.0,74.0,5,47.0,"The corridor outside her room held only a few other colonists. They were already awake and moving about, but they gave Nora a wide berth. She didn't blame them for being wary. The colony's security system was notoriously unreliable.

She stopped in front of the communal bathroom and peered inside. A young woman named Lena stood beside the sink, washing her hands. Lena was taller than Nora, blonde, and pale-skinned with blue eyes. Her hair was short and straight, like a boy's.

Nora walked up to the wall next to the door, pressing her face to it to peer around the corner. About twenty meters away, two men leaned over the railing at the top of a stairwell. They looked down on the area where the colonists had their meals.

At the bottom of the stairs, a group of three men sat in a circle talking. One man was tall and thin with dark brown skin. He wore his black hair long and braided. Another man was shorter and rounder, with curly red hair and freckles. His beard was neatly trimmed and he wore a white tunic under a gray cloak. The third man was average height, though broader in shoulder and chest than most people of Presley's Promise. He also wore a white robe, but was barefoot, as if the cold didn't bother him.

Nora stared for a moment before turning back to the bathroom and continuing on her way. She couldn't hear what they were saying from this distance, but she could tell that the red-haired man was arguing with the others about something.

The colonists'breakfast room was located in a small building off of the main concourse. It held only a few tables, each one occupied by a family or cluster of friends. Nora stepped inside and found Lena and another woman, Adele, sitting at a table together with two other men and women.

""Good morning,"" Nora said to them, smiling. ""I'm just going to get some breakfast.""

They responded with polite greetings. The man next to Adele gestured toward the food station. Nora nodded and walked over to it, pushing through a crowd of colonists who had already gathered around the line. As usual, there were no seats available.

Nora picked up a tray and filled her plate with eggs, bacon, and toast before walking back to the table where everyone was waiting. Lena and Adele looked like they hadn't slept well. Their eyes were bloodshot and their hair was knotted with tangles.

""You okay?"" Nora asked.

Adele nodded. ""We're fine. We just didn't want to wake you.""

Lena gave Nora a weak smile. ""Thanks for asking.""

Nora put her tray down on the table and sat across from them. She smiled at Adele and said, ""How are your feet?""

""They're fine,"" Adele replied with a shrug. ""I've got better things to worry about than my feet.""

Nora laughed. ""I know what you mean.""

The conversation went back to normal after that. Lena and Adele ate in silence while Nora chatted with the two other men.

257,0.5,0.5,1.0,87.0,6,45.0,"The halls were filled with colonists working their shifts. The corridors were quiet at dawn. Nora passed a few people she knew, but they were occupied by their own concerns. She ignored them and kept moving, her boots clacking loudly on the hard surface.

Nora's work area was at the end of a long corridor, near the dormitories. A small office sat nearby where she could oversee the power plant that powered the colony. She climbed up a ladder to gain access to the maintenance bays above the reactor core.

The air in the bay was thick with the smell of overheated metal, gunpowder, and ozone. Nora breathed through her mouth as she worked, trying not to gag from the stench.

She checked the diagnostic monitors, then opened the hatch in front of the reactor core itself. The interior was a maze of pipes, conduits, and cables. Nora stood on a catwalk and peered inside the reactor chamber.

The reactor core was a large, circular, black hole. It looked like a giant misshapen eyeball floating in space. The entire complex was a huge machine designed to create energy for the colony.

Nora studied the control panels and readouts, checking the status of the reactors and the nuclear fuel rods. Her eyes roamed across the screens, taking it all in, searching for the problem.

A faint flicker of light caught her attention. Nora squinted at the screen. There was something wrong with one of the reactor cores. She zoomed in on the image, but didn't recognize what she saw.

""What's going on?"" Nora muttered. ""It looks like an overload.""

She tried to focus on the screen, but the lights were too bright and the sound of her own breathing drowned out any other noise.

The reactor was reacting erratically, sending steam and smoke into the air.

Nora jumped down from the catwalk and ran back along the corridor toward the dorms. She'd have to get help from someone else, maybe even leave the colony and go to the Company.

The thought made her feel sick with fear and apprehension. But the reactor was a danger to everyone on the colony, so she had no choice.

She hurried past the dormitories and climbed the ladder up to the command center. The door slid open at her touch, and Nora stepped inside.

Director Rowena Chen sat behind a large desk in the center of the room. Several screens lined the walls, displaying various views from cameras scattered around the colony. A small computer terminal rested on the corner of the desk.

Rowena looked up at Nora's entrance. ""I'm glad you're here,"" she said, rising to her feet. ""We've got trouble.""

Nora swallowed hard and nodded. She still wasn't used to the idea of speaking with an AI. It felt like talking to a person, but without the ability to see the speaker or hear their voice.

""What kind?"" Nora asked.

""There's been some sort of malfunction in one of the reactors."" Rowena pointed to a screen showing footage from outside. ""The reactor is spewing smoke and steam into the air. I don't know if it'll blow up, but we can't have that happening on our watch.""

258,0.5,0.6,1.0,84.0,3,43.0,"The hallway outside her room was dark save for faint glimmers from the lamps spaced at intervals along its length. The lights were dim, but they did their job of keeping the hallways lit. A few colonists passed by, but most were still asleep.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, where she could grab a quick meal before heading back to her work. Her boots clomped on the metal grating. She stopped at the entrance, peering through the gloom for signs of life. There was no one in sight.

She entered the dining area. It was empty too. Nora sighed. She really needed food. But if there wasn't anyone around, there wouldn't be any food either.

Nora turned to leave when a voice called out behind her. ""Hey! Nora!""

She spun on her heel, heart pounding. A figure emerged from the shadows of the opposite end of the hallway. It was a tall man with long black hair and a lean, muscular build. He wore a dark blue uniform and held his arms outstretched, palms up.

""Who are you?"" Nora asked warily.

He smiled, revealing white teeth and bright eyes. ""I'm your friend.""

Nora hesitated at the sight of him. She didn't know what to make of this stranger. His smile seemed friendly enough, but he looked like trouble.

The man's face was handsome, but there was something unsettling about it. His nose was large, prominent, and straight, giving his features a sharp, angular look. His lips were thin and mobile. His skin was pale, almost translucent, and Nora couldn't tell if he had any freckles or not.

His eyes were dark, intense, and piercing. They gave off an eerie glow in the dim light of the hallway. Nora found herself staring into them.

""You're... you're..."" She trailed off, unsure how to describe him. He was just so different from anyone she'd ever met before. ""Are you a robot?""

""No,"" he said with amusement. ""I'm human.""

Nora frowned, confused. ""But I thought robots don't have emotions.""

He laughed. ""Of course they do. Just not the ones you think of. Robots are programmed to act a certain way, and we humans can't help but respond to each other. We feel things too.""

Nora felt her stomach churn at the idea of being able to read another person's thoughts, but she didn't want to offend him. ""So why did you call me?""

""Because I needed your help."" He stepped closer, and Nora tensed, expecting a trap. But he held out his hand, palm up, and smiled again.

She took it hesitantly. His grip was strong, warm, and dry.

""I'm looking for someone,"" he said quietly. ""A woman named Nora Decker.""

Nora's heart pounded. Her pulse thundered in her ears. She could barely hear herself think.

""How do you know my name?""

""I've been following you for a while now. I'm here because I need your help.""

Nora blinked, taken aback. ""What do you mean? How do you know who I am?""

His smile faded. ""I need to find the hive.""

Nora felt her blood run cold. She knew what he meant. The Company had sent her here to investigate the colony's malfunctioning tech, and the colonists were afraid of something down there.

259,0.5,0.6,1.0,79.0,3,43.0,"The hallway was dimly lit with small lights set in the ceiling to conserve energy. The walls were lined with doorways leading to other residential rooms—the colony's dormitories. Each room was occupied by a single person, mostly men, but women outnumbered them too.

Nora made her way through the hall, past the communal showers at the end of each corridor, to the cafeteria. As she passed one of the smaller rooms, she heard someone snoring. A woman slept on the cot inside.

Nora paused outside the door. After a moment's hesitation, she knocked softly.

The snoring stopped abruptly. ""Who is it?""

""It's Nora.""

There was a pause as the sleeping woman considered this. Then, with an uncharacteristic show of carelessness, she said, ""I'm not awake yet. Go away.""

Nora smiled grimly. ""You can't sleep forever.""

The door opened. The woman stared at her from bleary eyes, then blinked when she saw who it was. She mumbled something unintelligible. Nora didn't bother to translate. The woman scowled and pulled the door shut.

Nora shook her head in disgust. This was how colonists acted around strangers now? They were a sorry lot indeed. But they had no one else to blame for their sorry state but themselves.

She turned back toward the cafeteria.

A man came out of one of the rooms near the end of the hall, carrying a tray with food on it. He glanced at her, then looked away quickly. His shoulders slumped as he walked down the hall, his gaze fixed straight ahead.

Nora followed him. The man set down his tray, then stopped walking. With a shock, Nora realized the man was staring right at her. She froze, feeling exposed.

He cleared his throat awkwardly. ""Excuse me."" He craned his neck to look over his shoulder at her. ""Are you...?""

Nora nodded slowly. She couldn't help herself; she still felt like a rabbit caught in the headlights. His face was pale and sickly, with dark circles under his eyes. His hair hung lank and greasy across the back of his head.

""I'm Nora. I work here.""

His mouth twitched. ""Oh,"" he said vaguely. His eyes darted away from hers.

Nora waited. The man didn't speak again.

After a moment, she asked, ""What's your name?""

""Kai.""

""Hi Kai,"" Nora said. ""I'll be working with you today.""

""Okay,"" he murmured. He looked at her, then away.

Nora moved closer. The man seemed nervous. She could feel it. She decided to try a different approach. ""You're new, aren't you? You don't know anyone yet.""

He nodded, but didn't say anything else.

Nora smiled. ""Well, I'm sure we'll get along fine together. After all, we have a lot in common."" She gestured to his tray. ""Let me guess—you haven't eaten since yesterday, right?""

The man nodded again. He looked down at his food, then shook his head.

Nora frowned. ""No appetite, huh? Well, I'll make you some breakfast. It's not much, but it should fill your stomach.""

260,0.5,0.6,1.0,90.0,5,42.0,"The corridors were dim and quiet. The colonists had been awake for hours by now, but the halls remained empty at this early hour. Nora padded along, trying to avoid making too much noise while she moved in her heavy boots. She passed two other colonists who stood guard duty near the entrance. They nodded to her, their eyes hidden behind dark goggles and visors.

Nora stopped outside the door to the mess hall. Through the glass windows, she could see a few colonists eating breakfast. Her stomach rumbled with hunger and anticipation; she needed food badly.

Nora turned to leave again. Before she reached the exit, however, the door opened and another crew member stepped out. He looked at Nora in surprise, then his eyes widened as he took in her appearance. His gaze lingered on her bare feet, which made her cheeks flush red.

""Good morning,"" Nora said, smiling shyly. ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get you up.""

The man's face softened a little. ""No problem. Are you hungry? We're always short of staff at this time.""

She shook her head and smiled even more brightly. ""Not really. But thanks for asking.""

He nodded and stepped back inside, closing the door. Nora waited until she heard the lock click into place before turning to walk away.

Nora's boots clacked on metal flooring as she left the mess hall. She passed several other colonists, but they were too busy eating or drinking to notice her. At the end of the corridor, she paused at the entrance to an elevator bank and pushed a button. The doors slid open with a faint hum.

Nora stepped inside, and the doors shut behind her. A moment later, the car started moving down, its slow progress echoing in the cramped space. She shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as she rode it down to the ground level. Even though her job required her to work outside, she remained uncomfortable being so exposed on this planet.

The air was thin and dry here. Nora breathed deeply of it gratefully, feeling the cold oxygen invigorate her lungs after the airless lift ride. Her eyes watered slightly as a gust of wind tugged at her hair.

Nora exited the building and walked across the lot to the transport bay. As she approached, she saw two colonists waiting there with their gear. They wore bulky backpacks and carried rifles. One of them turned to look at Nora as the other spoke into his radio.

""We're ready,"" he said. ""Let's go.""

Nora nodded and headed for the transport, which was parked on the far side of the hangar. She climbed aboard with her companions and buckled herself in. The ship lifted off the ground and soared up into the sky.

Nora sat in a seat near the front of the cabin. She watched the scenery below while the pilot flew the craft through the dust clouds.

261,0.5,0.6,1.0,78.0,4,47.0,"As she passed by the dormitory common room, the smell of fresh coffee filled her nose. She knew for a fact that there wasn't supposed to be any left. The colonists had been warned about it when they came here. But the aroma was so enticing that she couldn't resist.

She slipped out the front door, following the scent of freshly brewed coffee. A few people stood in the courtyard, talking quietly. They were all human males, as usual. Nora frowned and walked past them without acknowledging their presence.

The sun hadn't risen yet, but the sky was already growing lighter. Muted illumination from the stars glittered off the metallic surfaces of the colony complex. Nora's eyes adjusted to the dimness, allowing her to see more clearly as she approached the mess hall.

Nora stepped inside, blinking at the sudden brightness. She inhaled sharply, taking in the scene before her. All the tables were empty except for one where a man sat staring into space.

At first Nora thought he might be sleeping, but then she saw his eyes darting back and forth behind closed lids. He was trembling. His hands gripped the table top with white knuckles. She moved closer to get a better look, but stopped short as the man's head jerked up.

His face was pale, sweat beading on his forehead. His eyes were wide open, but unfocused. He didn't seem to notice her presence. Then Nora realized that the man was crying and she stepped away from him, horrified.

""Hey!"" she shouted. ""Hey! Hey!""

The man looked around wildly, but still didn't focus on Nora. Instead, he stared at the wall in front of him. Nora took another step backward until she bumped into the doorframe. The man was shaking violently now, like a child having an epileptic seizure.

""What's wrong with you?"" Nora asked.

The man turned to her. He seemed to be looking through her, not seeing her at all. Nora felt a chill run down her spine. He was so far gone he wasn't even aware of her presence.

For a moment, Nora considered calling for help. But the man was clearly in some kind of trauma induced trance and it would take too long to rouse others. She'd have to watch him alone.

Nora moved closer, trying to get a better look at the man's face. He lifted his hand as though to touch her, but stopped short. The trembling eased slightly. Nora took another step forward, peering into the man's eyes.

Then she gasped.

The man's pupils were dilated so wide they nearly covered half of his irises. His eyes had changed color from blue to black. The whites were also bloodshot and red, almost glowing.

He started crying again. Nora wanted to scream at him to stop, but the man wasn't responding to anything she said or did. She grabbed his shoulders, shaking him in a panic, but he didn't seem to notice her at all.

Suddenly, something cold touched Nora's bare arm—something wet. Her body froze in shock. Then the man's head lolled forward and Nora let out a shriek, pushing him away with both hands.

""What? What is it?""

Her voice sounded distant to her own ears. The man's eyes rolled back into his skull, showing only white. His mouth hung slackly open. Nora had seen enough.

262,0.5,0.6,1.0,83.0,5,43.0,"She found Sully at the entrance to the dormitories, already clad in a similar outfit. The two men greeted each other while they walked side-by-side toward the cafeteria.

Nora's boots clacked on the polished surface as she followed her partner through the corridors, scanning the walls for any sign of damage. They passed several colonists working on various tasks, but the hallways were otherwise empty.

The colony's population was small enough that the halls were not crowded. But the residents took their jobs seriously. They worked hard to keep the colony running despite the constant breakdowns. While Nora and Sully walked, a young woman with dark hair and thick glasses came around a corner carrying a basket of laundry.

""Morning, Mr. Decker,"" the girl said cheerfully as she walked past them. ""Good morning, Miss Decker.""

Nora nodded back at her in acknowledgment, then glanced down at her companion. He'd been so still for a moment, Nora hadn't noticed his scowl.

""What's wrong?"" she asked.

Sully shrugged. ""Nothing. Just... nothing.""

Nora felt a pang of sympathy. Her own partner was always quiet when he was troubled, but Sully had an even more intense nature than most men.

They exited the dormitory building and crossed the grounds to the cafeteria. The low-ceilinged room was dimly lit from a few overhead lights, but the windows were open to allow the cool breeze to circulate. A pair of colonists manned the serving line while a third man stood behind the counter.

Nora scanned the menu posted on one wall, then pointed at the breakfast bar. ""Two scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee,"" she said.

The server, a middle-aged woman with short brown hair, handed her the tray. ""We'll be out of that in about ten minutes, ma'am.""

Nora nodded as she sat down and began to eat. She was ravenous after a night spent working on repairs.

Sully watched her with a frown. ""You're not going to get sick again, are you?""

She shook her head. ""I'm fine.""

""You don't look fine,"" he said, his voice tight.

Nora chewed a bite of egg then swallowed it in one gulp. ""It's just an upset stomach. I'll be fine once we get back to work.""

Sully nodded and focused on his food. He ate methodically, without much appetite.

Nora pushed the plate away, feeling guilty for eating when her partner looked so worried. She glanced at him and saw he was staring at her with a fierce intensity. For a moment, their eyes locked.

""What?"" she asked.

He frowned. ""Nothing. It's nothing.""

Nora felt her lips quirk into a smile. ""You sure? You have that look, Sully. What are you thinking about?""

His face reddened. ""All right! Enough!"" He slammed his fork onto the table and shoved to his feet. ""I'm going to go take a shower.""

""Okay,"" Nora said, surprised at how relieved she was that he'd finally broken down. She watched him hurry from the cafeteria before returning to her meal.

""Morning, Nora.""

""Good morning, Sully.""

Sully's smile faded as he realized she wasn't wearing her uniform. ""You're not supposed to be off duty yet,"" he said.

Nora shrugged. ""I'm just going to grab something quick. I'll be right back.""

Sully nodded absently, then turned his attention back to his work. Nora walked down the hall to the cafeteria where the smell of fresh bread filled the air. She paused outside the door, looking for a moment at the mess of dishes stacked in the sink next to the counter, then stepped inside.

The dining room was packed with colonists. Most of them were working on their breakfasts as Nora entered, but a few glanced up from their tables and returned to their meals. The noise of conversation and chewing was deafening.

She stepped up to the serving counter and waited for a server to notice her. When the man finally did, Nora asked him if there were any extra rolls or toast in the kitchen.

""Just one roll left,"" he replied. ""And we don't have much butter.""

Nora sighed inwardly. She had to take what she could get. ""That will be fine,"" she said.

The man nodded at her, then moved off to help someone else. Nora grabbed the last loaf of bread from the rack, wrapped it in paper towel, and headed for the door. She was just stepping out when a hand closed around her wrist.

Nora yelped in surprise, whirling to face the colonists, who stared at her in astonishment.

A young woman with black hair and deep brown eyes stood behind Nora. Her dark skin contrasted sharply with the white shirt and gray pants she wore, making her look like a ghost against the pale background of the dining room. She smiled nervously. ""Sorry,"" she said.

""No problem."" Nora relaxed and took a step back, letting the other woman go.

The girl's voice was soft, friendly. ""I'm Sarah,"" she said.

Nora nodded politely. ""Nora,"" she replied. ""You're new here?""

Sarah nodded. ""Yes. I came down from the Company about three months ago.""

""That must be exciting!"" Nora exclaimed.

Sarah looked surprised. ""Exciting? Yes, I suppose so...""

""Oh, you'll love it here! The Company has the best technology money can buy,"" Nora assured her. ""It's a great place to work.""

""But... but what do we do if there are problems or malfunctions?"" Sarah asked.

Nora raised an eyebrow. ""We fix them!""

Sarah nodded slowly. ""Yes. Of course. But what happens if we can't find the problem?""

Nora shrugged. ""Then we get creative.""

""Creative?""

""Sure. We improvise,"" Nora said. ""And if that doesn't work, we improvise some more. It's not a bad way of life, really.""

Sarah nodded, looking uncertain, then she smiled again. ""Well, I'll be glad to have you around.""

Nora returned the smile and started toward the door. Sarah followed her out into the hall. She paused at the threshold.

Nora wasn't. She didn't have any duties beyond keeping the lights on and food in the mess hall. But she didn't mind. After the long hours of work, a few minutes to herself was welcome.

She walked down the corridor, past the cafeteria, toward the main concourse. Nora liked the concourse, even if it did smell like stale grease from the power plant's machinery. It smelled good to her.

Ahead, the command center was dark. She paused at the door, glancing back over her shoulder. No one else had emerged yet.

Nora opened the door with a sigh and stepped inside. The room was dimly lit, but the walls were covered in soft green light that made everything look softer and more inviting than it should have been. Nora took a deep breath of the familiar scent of the air, then crossed to the control panel. She pressed a button and the lights brightened.

The entire colony was built around a central concourse. The concourse was a large open space surrounded by offices, conference rooms, and luxury suites for Company executives. A wide, enclosed walkway connected the command center to the dormitories and laboratories.

Nora turned to face the main screen, which showed a close-up of the command center. Nora studied the screen, looking for the telltale signs of tampering. There were none.

She sat down in front of the console, then reached up to press another button.

""Good morning, Director Chen.""

Nora's head snapped up. She saw no one.

The console beeped twice and the lights flickered on. The AI spoke again, its voice calm and soothing. ""Director Rowena Chen will see you now. Please enter your access code.""

Nora frowned. The AI was supposed to be off limits. She didn't know why it was talking to her.

She entered the access code, then waited while the door slid open. Nora stepped through into a small office with a single chair. The door closed behind her.

The room was dark, but Nora could make out the faint outline of a figure sitting in the chair. It seemed to glow faintly green.

Nora walked forward. As she neared, she realized the figure wasn't glowing at all. It was just the light from the screen reflecting off the man's face.

He looked like he'd been carved from stone, his skin so pale it was almost translucent. His hair hung loose around his shoulders, and his eyes were black pits that stared straight ahead. He wore a white lab coat over a plain shirt and pants.

""Hello,"" Nora said. ""I'm—""

Nora made her way toward the cafeteria, but stopped short at a familiar sight. She paused on the threshold of the dining hall, staring at the dark, shadowed room.

She was hungry. Her stomach growled. But the scene before her was not what Nora needed right now.

A body lay sprawled across the table.

Nora stared in disbelief.

The corpse was that of a woman. Nora knew the face. She'd spent time with her during the last few weeks.

""Oh my God...""

But Nora couldn't bring herself to approach the body.

Her mind flashed back to the hideous monsters from her nightmares. They were real. The aliens had attacked the colony. She remembered the screams of dying colonists, the blood and gore they left behind.

Nora shuddered.

She didn't want to see more death.

She stepped away from the door, pulling the jacket tight around her as she walked. The corridor was empty. No one else appeared in the halls.

Nora hurried down the corridor to the cafeteria, where she found a solitary man, seated alone at an unused table under dim lights. He wore a dark brown uniform shirt and trousers with boots. Nora recognized the uniform from the Company's advertisements.

She approached the table, trying to keep her expression neutral. ""Hello?""

The man looked up at Nora. His eyes were pale blue. He was young, perhaps in his mid-twenties.

""Excuse me,"" Nora said. ""I'm looking for the cafeteria.""

""It's this way."" The man stood quickly. ""My name is Andrew.""

Nora nodded in acknowledgment. Andrew led Nora to the back of the dining hall, where a set of stairs climbed toward the top floor.

They walked side by side along the narrow stairwell, passing a few other corridors.

Andrew paused at the end of one of these smaller corridors and turned around.

""This is it,"" he said.

The hallway ended with a large double door, which opened into a small lounge area. A bank of monitors showed the interior of the colony. The room was empty except for two chairs and a table.

Nora entered the room and sat down in one chair, waiting for Andrew to sit opposite her.

He did so, but remained standing as he spoke. ""You're new here.""

Nora nodded.

""I'm sorry about your friend,"" Andrew said. ""We haven't seen any aliens yet.""

""What happened to her?"" Nora asked.

""A malfunction in the power plant,"" Andrew said. ""She was killed when a conduit overloaded.""

Nora nodded, biting down on the inside of her cheek to keep herself from saying something stupid. She knew what had happened to the woman. It couldn't have been an accident.

""It's like we've got a ghost running the place,"" Nora said.

Andrew glanced at her. His eyes were wide and pale. ""Yes. We do.""

""Who is she?"" Nora asked.

""Her name was Anna. I'm sorry you met her under such sad circumstances.""

A handful of them sat up, rubbing bleary eyes, but they noticed Nora and quickly returned to their slumber. The morning air was crisp and fresh after the humidity of the day before.

The main corridor that led from her quarters to the communal dining hall was dimly lit by glows in the ceiling. Nora walked through it with purpose, stopping only when she reached the commotion of the main concourse.

She found a crowd gathered around one of the colonists there. He stood near the edge of the concourse, his back to her as he spoke to several people while gesturing wildly.

Nora frowned. This wasn't part of any scheduled shift. What was going on?

A man approached Nora, speaking in hushed tones. ""The drones are coming.""

Nora looked at him with wide eyes. It took her a moment to realize what he was saying, and then the full weight of the situation hit her.

""They're here?"" she asked. ""How do you know?""

He shook his head. ""We don't know. But we saw them last night. We've known about the drones for weeks, but it's not until now that they're in the open as far as we can tell. They must be planning something.""

Nora nodded. She'd heard that some of the colonists had seen the drones stalking their way over the past few days. The colonists were afraid, and rightly so.

The drones could be anywhere in the colony by now, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

Nora turned away from the man, scanning the crowd. Where was everybody else? The colonists were supposed to shut down power to the entire colony at night. If they hadn't done it yet, they should have.

Nora scanned the rest of the concourse. At least half the colonists were still asleep. That wasn't good.

She didn't want to think about what kind of damage the drones might do in this state. There was no telling how many people they'd killed already.

The man came up behind Nora and touched her shoulder. He spoke quietly. ""I need you to stay here.""

""What?"" she asked, turning around with a frown. Her voice rose in pitch. ""Why?""

He shook his head. ""You're the best engineer we've got. I'm going out there.""

Nora stared at him. Then she turned on her heel and stormed off toward the dormitory wing. She needed to get to work.

The colonists were still asleep when Nora reached her quarters. What was happening?

She opened her door and stepped inside, then stopped short.

A drone stood near the center of the room, watching her. It looked like one of the small drones from the native hive. But this one had larger eyes with a wider range of vision, and it was covered in black chitin.

Nora stared at it for a moment. She knew enough about drones to know that this one wasn't the same type. This one was waiting for something.

267,0.5,0.6,1.0,87.0,4,44.0,"The corridors were empty except for a few workers scurrying along them. Nora passed by the first two bays where other colonists ate, then stopped at the third bay. A large, square room filled with tables and chairs stood just outside the cafeteria. The room was full of people eating.

Noticing her, one man looked up from his plate. He was a tall, thin fellow with dark hair. His eyes widened in recognition when he saw Nora, but his expression quickly changed to annoyance.

""Morning,"" Nora said brightly. ""You're late.""

He mumbled something rude under his breath, then turned back to his food.

Nora sighed and walked on, wondering what had happened to make him so angry. She noticed several other colonists glancing at her as she went past, but none of them made eye contact.

The cafeteria was noisy and crowded with colonists eating breakfast. Nora ducked through a side door into the kitchen area and found a small table in a corner. As she sat down, a young girl came out of another room carrying a tray loaded with a steaming bowl of porridge topped with fresh fruit, a slice of toast, and a mug of coffee. The girl smiled as she set the tray on the table beside Nora's.

""Good morning!"" the girl chirped cheerfully. ""I'm Grace. I'll be your waitress today.""

Nora blinked in surprise. ""Really?""

Grace nodded vigorously. ""Yep! You just have to tell me what you want.""

""Um... okay. Um..."" She hesitated, then took a deep breath. ""A cup of coffee would be great.""

The girl grinned broadly and hurried off to the counter. Nora watched her go with a frown before turning back to the food on her plate. She picked up the hot, fragrant spoonful of porridge and brought it to her mouth.

It burned.

She dropped the spoon with a curse. It clattered onto the tabletop. Nora shook her head in disbelief. The porridge was too hot for even an experienced cook like herself to prepare properly. She glanced around the room, but no one seemed to notice. No one else had spilled their breakfast.

Nora pushed away from the table and stood up. She looked down at the remains of her meal, then set it aside and headed toward the door. After walking a few steps, she turned back and snatched up the spoon again. With a sigh, Nora scooped up some more porridge and returned to her seat.

The porridge tasted burnt. She ate the rest of it anyway.

Nora finished her meal, then walked briskly out into the corridor. The cafeteria was still crowded with colonists eating and talking. She passed through the room without stopping, but several of them made eye contact and nodded in silent acknowledgment.

Outside, Nora paused. She looked up at the sky. A pale mist hung over the colony and obscured stars. The air was cold enough to burn her lungs. Not good weather for a walk. She rubbed her arms absently, then shrugged off her jacket and stuffed it under one arm before continuing down the main concourse.

The corridors were wide and straight with low ceilings.

268,0.5,0.7,1.0,86.0,3,44.0,"The halls were empty. Nora paused at the door to check the time. The alarm hadn't rung yet, so she had plenty of time.

Nora walked quickly down the hall and opened the door to the communal kitchen. A few colonists sat around the table, but most of them were still asleep.

She grabbed a tray from the stack on the counter and filled it with her ration bar, a glass of water, and a small bowl of fruit. She glanced at the clock again.

The bell rang. Nora hurried to the end of the hallway and pushed through the doorway.

""Morning,"" she said with a smile. ""I'm sorry I overslept.""

Colonist Zoey was already at the head of the line. She smiled back. ""Don't worry about it. We're both late for work.""

The kitchen staff would be busy preparing breakfast, but they always had extra food stashed in the freezers. Zoey grabbed a plate and carried it to the serving counter. Nora followed her lead.

As she took her place, Zoey asked, ""How are you feeling? You looked pretty bad last night.""

""Better this morning. Thanks.""

Zoey nodded. ""Good. You'll need your energy today.""

Nora ate quickly while the other colonists talked among themselves or ate their own breakfast. She finished and pushed her tray away.

Zoey put her dishes into a dishwasher and washed up. Nora did the same. They dried off with towels and left the kitchen together.

Outside, Nora blinked at the bright sunlight and inhaled deeply. The air smelled fresh and crisp. It was a pleasant contrast to the smoke-tinged air of the colony.

""I wonder if it's going to rain,"" Nora mused.

""Probably not."" Zoey pointed toward the sky. ""That looks like a clear day.""

Nora nodded. ""Maybe we'll get lucky and find some good weather.""

They walked side by side along the main concourse. Nora glanced at Zoey. ""I'm glad you came with me.""

Zoey smiled. ""Me too. I know how hard it is for you to go alone.""

Nora looked away, embarrassed. She'd never said anything about her fears out loud before.

Zoey continued, ""You're brave. Strong. But you don't always have to be so strong.""

Nora nodded, feeling warm. Zoey was a friend and an ally. Nora owed her many thanks. She didn't want to fail. And she knew now what she had to do.

""Thank you,"" Nora said.

Zoey smiled. ""It's my job.""

""I know."" A single tear trailed down Nora's cheek, but she refused to let it show. She wiped her eyes and turned away from Zoey. ""I'll see you later.""

Nora walked quickly through the halls and into the command center. The room was dimly lit by a few small lights. Nora paused to catch her breath and adjust her glasses.

She stepped up to the console at the front of the room. The monitor on the wall flickered to life, displaying a map of the colony grounds. It showed the locations of the colonists.

269,0.5,0.7,1.0,83.0,4,46.0,"The corridors were empty at this early hour except for one person—Sully, the colony's administrator. He stood in the hall beside a large door marked 'Maintenance'. The door was open to reveal the garage where power loaders and other vehicles were parked, and he leaned on it with a frown.

""Hey Sully,"" Nora said as she approached him. ""You need any help?""

He looked up at her and smiled weakly. ""Nora, I'm fine.""

""I know you are."" Nora gave him a wry smile. ""But if something goes wrong with one of your systems, we're going to have to fix it ourselves.""

""Don't worry about that,"" Sully replied. ""The Company has sent maintenance crews before.""

Nora nodded. ""Still, it might be better if you got some backup from the crew.""

Sully sighed and scratched his head. ""No. It isn't necessary. They've already been here, and they didn't find anything. We can handle it.""

Nora frowned at him. ""But—""

A distant chime interrupted her. Sully held up a hand to cut her off. ""That's them now, I think.""

Nora waited for the door to open, but it remained closed. She stepped forward and peered through a small window set into the panel beside the door. A blue light shone on one side of the door, indicating that someone was waiting outside.

""They're in the lobby,"" Nora whispered. Sully leaned in closer to hear her.

""Let me go first,"" he said. ""You stay back.""

Nora nodded.

Sully opened the door and stepped out. He walked to the end of the corridor and turned left. Nora followed him with her eyes until she lost sight of him.

She stopped at the intersection and leaned against a wall. Her stomach growled again, reminding her of how hungry she still was after too little sleep. She glanced around at the empty corridors, then down at her feet.

Her boots were scuffed from walking on the rocky ground, but it wasn't enough to make her want to get them dirty again. With a sigh, Nora pulled off one boot and dropped it to the floor. The other boot fell off without resistance, revealing bare toes, which curled away from each other in awkward angles.

Nora looked up at the ceiling, puzzled. She didn't remember putting on the second boot.

The light above the door flashed green. Nora caught a glimpse of Sully's face in the window before he closed the door. He was smiling, his eyes sparkling behind the lenses of his glasses.

Nora stared at the door for a moment more before turning and heading back to her quarters.

* * *

It took Nora two tries to get into her boots after leaving the dormitory, but she finally managed it. She had no time to waste, so she put on her jacket, grabbed her utility belt with its pockets full of tools, and headed toward the garage.

The corridor was dimly lit, but the light came from a small panel set into the wall beside every doorway.

270,0.5,0.7,1.0,83.0,6,48.0,"She paused at the end of the hall to check the time on her comm. The red digital numbers read 0500 hours, which meant she had less than thirty minutes to get ready for duty. She shouldered past the other colonists, who were just waking up. Only a few of them seemed to be awake. Most of the rest were still asleep in their beds.

Nora left the dormitory behind, heading toward the administration building where Sully worked. She spotted him sitting on a stool in front of the large control panel that controlled the colony's power plant. He was working through the list of things he wanted to fix today. She knew that much because the list scrolled across the display.

Nora walked over to join him. ""Good morning, Sully.""

""Morning,"" he said without looking up from his work. ""How many people are there in the colony?""

""Six hundred and fifty-one,"" Nora answered with a shrug. ""We're not big on population projections.""

Sully nodded absently. ""I'll need to finish this before I can start fixing anything else. I've got a lot of work ahead of me today.""

Nora watched him for a moment, then turned away. She headed back to her quarters to grab something to eat while she waited for the colonists to wake up.

The cafeteria was located near the dormitories, but it wasn't open yet. Nora settled down at one of the tables and glanced around. The cafeteria was relatively small, with only a few dozen tables. A large serving counter took up most of the room's space, and the tables were arranged in two rows facing each other.

A line snaked out from the counter, where an attendant served breakfast to those who wanted it. The food was simple, consisting of eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and coffee. Nora selected a plate from the serving cart and filled it with scrambled eggs and a slice of bacon. She added a glass of orange juice.

While she ate, Nora stared at the ceiling and tried to decide what to do about the colony's power plant. The colonists had no solar panels on their roof, so they depended entirely on the fusion reactor to provide electricity. But that meant the reactor needed constant maintenance, which Sully couldn't accomplish in a day.

Nora sighed and pushed her plate aside. She wished she could go back to bed, but the alarm would be going off soon if she didn't get moving.

She stood up and walked toward the exit. As she left the cafeteria, Nora spotted a group of colonists standing outside the community hall. They were gathered around a table with a large map.

Nora paused and watched them for a moment. The colonists were clustered together in small groups, studying the map and talking among themselves. Nora recognized most of them, although not everyone. Most of the faces looked familiar, even though they weren't people she'd worked with before.

271,0.5,0.7,1.0,88.0,6,47.0,"The corridor outside her room was empty except for two other colonists hunched over their morning coffee in one corner, talking quietly while they ate. The colonists were both young women, dark haired and attractive, with similar builds. They shared the same affectation of grey-green eyes and pale skin, but otherwise the similarities ended there. One woman wore a loose, flowing dress, her hair tied up in a bun at the back of her neck. Her companion was dressed in a practical jumpsuit.

Nora smiled to herself as she passed them, thinking that it must be nice to have friends who could get along. She didn't hate either of them, but neither did she like them.

The colonists were friendly enough. But Nora couldn't think about them without remembering the attack the night before, and the way they had looked at her when she had been dragged into the dormitory after being knocked unconscious by the drone.

She shook her head, trying to clear her mind of thoughts of the night before, but her memories wouldn't fade. Instead, they became more intense. She remembered the way they had stared at her, and how they hadn't even tried to help her.

Nora's teeth clenched as the memory of the last moment before she'd blacked out returned to haunt her. The aliens had attacked the colonists, but not just any humans. They had gone for Nora first because she was a woman.

It wasn't fair. It wasn't right.

Nora ignored the nagging guilt and walked briskly down the hallway, taking care to avoid the other colonists as she made her way to the mess hall.

Nora pushed open the door and stepped inside. A few people were already sitting at one of the long tables that lined the room, but most of the tables were empty. Nora took a seat near an exit and waited patiently while others arrived.

The colonists sat in small groups huddled around their breakfast bowls, talking quietly. Nora didn't know many of them by name, but she knew they worked together on the colony's farms and helped with the maintenance work, so she felt comfortable enough to sit alone.

She sipped her coffee and watched the colonists talk quietly among themselves. They were young women, like herself, but they weren't friends. They had no reason to be. She was the only engineer assigned to this crew, so she spent most of her time working solo.

Her thoughts kept drifting back to the attack last night. If the aliens hadn't targeted Nora specifically, then why? Why did they go after her at all?

Nora frowned as she tried to figure it out. The colonists couldn't have been involved. They were too busy looking for supplies and trying to keep the lights on. But if not them, who else was there to blame?

Nora shook her head. It didn't matter. There wasn't anyone here who could help. She was on her own.

She finished her coffee, feeling a bit better about things. Nothing had changed. Nora still had to fix the problem.

Nora pushed back from the table and left the mess hall. She walked down the corridor, passing the other colonists, and headed towards the command center.

The corridors of the colony were narrow and dimly lit. The flooring was metal grating with conduits running along the walls.

272,0.5,0.7,1.0,84.0,6,48.0,"The hallways were dim and quiet. The colonists slept in shifts to conserve energy. Only a few people were awake, heading toward the mess hall for their morning meal.

Nora's boots tapped along the walkway as she headed in the general direction of the mess hall. She paused at the door, glancing around the corridor, then entered.

The air inside was thick with steam from the showers. At the far end of the room, the cooks worked tirelessly over a bank of burners.

Nora found her way to the food line, where she filled her plate with eggs, bacon, toast, and juice. She took her tray back to one of the tables near the window.

She ate quickly but quietly so as not to disturb anyone else. While the colonists weren't exactly starving, they didn't have much of a surplus either. Food supplies were limited, and everyone knew it. Nora had been too busy working for weeks now to eat anything more than raw rations.

After breakfast, Nora walked to the engineering bay. She wasn't scheduled for another job until later in the day, and she wanted some time to herself before starting on repairs.

Nora passed through the garage. The air was dry and cool here, and clean. She could see well enough in the dim light to navigate without her flashlight.

A low hum emanated from the power plant. Nora paused at the edge of the room, staring at the tall apparatus looming over the garage like a giant metal spider. A large access door stood open to reveal the guts of the machine.

Nora stepped closer, studying the machinery with fascination. It was a fusion reactor, the largest of its kind ever built.

A thick cable ran down one side of the chamber and into the ground. She followed the cable to a junction box near the base, where it split into two smaller cables. One went straight out of the building, while the other snaked across the floor before disappearing under the wall.

She stared at the small box. The cables fed into it from the power plant. Nora wondered if it had something to do with the malfunctioning equipment.

Nora peered through the hole in the wall, but the tunnel was too dark to see anything inside. She reached for her flashlight, then hesitated. If the aliens were in there...

The thought made her shudder. Nora shuddered again. Maybe I should just wait until someone else comes.

But she couldn't stand the idea of sitting idly around and waiting.

Nora pulled on a pair of work gloves. She slipped through the hole in the wall, leaning back against it to keep from scraping her head on the ceiling. The tunnel was narrow and rough. Nora held onto the cable to steady herself.

It was a tight squeeze for Nora, who was only five foot six inches tall. But she managed to wriggle forward several feet before encountering an obstacle.

A cluster of eggs had been laid along the floor of the passage, blocking Nora's way. The eggs were large, about three or four inches wide. They weren't like any kind of egg Nora had ever seen—the shells were smooth, glossy, and black.

273,0.5,0.7,1.0,74.0,3,46.0,"The colony's communal dining hall was located at the end of a long corridor lined with single-occupancy rooms. The corridor was dimly lit by a few lights set high overhead, but the corridor itself was well-lit and spacious. A large window ran along one wall, providing natural light to the room.

A small crowd filled the room, milling about in conversation, laughing, and eating from the trays provided. Nora scanned the faces until she found Sully Carmichael. He was standing next to the serving counter talking to one of the other colonists, a man named Roger.

""Hey there,"" Nora said as she approached. ""What're you two doing here?""

Sully turned around with a smile, motioning her over. ""Good morning, Nora. Are you ready for work today?""

Nora answered with a nod. ""I'm good."" She smiled back at him, then looked past his shoulder and saw Roger. ""Oh, hey there, Roger!""

Roger waved a hand in greeting. ""Morning, Nora.""

""You too."" Nora grinned at the man. His dark hair was cropped short, and he had a lean build and wore a thick beard. He was an older guy with a few more wrinkles than most of the others, but he seemed tough enough to stand up to whatever this planet threw at them.

""So how are things going out there? Anything exciting happen recently?"" Nora asked, trying to get some conversation started.

Roger shrugged. ""Same ol', same ol'. Nothing new. Maybe we'll find something interesting on the surface. If not, there's always the caves.""

""The caves?"" Nora repeated with a frown. ""That sounds dangerous. You know, I've heard stories about those caves. They're supposed to be full of monsters.""

""Yeah, well, it could be worse,"" Sully said. ""We don't have to go down there if we don't want too. We can just wait for supplies.""

Nora frowned. ""Wait for what?""

""Supplies. The Company sends them every few months. Sometimes they're late, but they usually send us enough food and water to keep us alive until then.""

""Oh, right."" Nora nodded. ""Well, maybe there will be something good to eat today."" She smiled again at Roger. ""Hey, thanks for telling me about the caves. I'll try not to get myself killed while exploring them.""

Roger laughed. ""Don't worry too much. They say the last time someone went into the caves, no one came back."" He looked up at the ceiling with a shrug. ""Of course, I wouldn't take any chances either way.""

""Me neither,"" Nora agreed. ""I'll be careful.""

Nora walked over to Sully and put her hand on his shoulder. ""You know, you're right. It'd suck if something happened to me out there.""

Sully squeezed her shoulder, then let go. ""Yeah, well, best of luck."" He glanced around. ""How about some breakfast?""

Nora shook her head. ""Thanks, but I'm not hungry yet.""

""Okay,"" Sully said with an understanding nod. ""We'll get together later. See ya.""

He turned away and began walking toward a nearby door, leaving Nora alone. She watched him leave, then sighed.

274,0.5,0.7,1.0,79.0,7,43.0,"The hallways were quiet at this early hour, but Nora could still hear the rattle and clang of tools being used in nearby bays. She passed by the gantry where colonists worked on their assigned tasks, each wearing a white coat over their clothes to protect them from sparks.

In the center of the colony's central plaza, the fusion plant hummed like a living thing, casting its blue glow across the surrounding structures. Nora paused to look up at the power plant's towering chimney that rose above the complex. The reactor was designed to be modular, so that the whole structure could be dismantled and shipped anywhere if necessary.

Nora climbed the stairs to the main concourse, which ran along the top of the wall separating the dormitories from the rest of the colony. At the end of the concourse, Nora turned right toward the command center.

The command center was situated in a large room at the very center of the colony. It had hardened walls, reinforced doors, and automated defense systems. The rest of the command center was offices, conference rooms, and luxury suites for Company executives.

Nora entered the command center, passing through the security checkpoint and into the inner sanctum. There, the Company's representatives worked in front of large monitors, communicating with the colonists and monitoring the planet's status.

A woman sat at a console at one side of the room, her face lit by the glow of the monitor screen. She wore an orange jumpsuit with a white collar. Her blonde hair hung loose around her shoulders, framing a pale oval face that was slightly pinched between high cheekbones and a small nose.

""Nora."" The woman looked up at Nora's approach, her eyes narrowing in recognition. ""You're on duty?""

Nora nodded. ""Yes, Commander Valentina Kern.""

Valentina stood up and walked over to meet Nora halfway across the room. They shook hands in a brisk, businesslike way, but their eyes still held some measure of warmth.

""Good morning, Nora,"" said Valentina, smiling faintly. ""I trust you slept well?""

Nora shrugged. ""Not really. I'm not used to sleeping so close together in such cramped quarters.""

""It'll be better once we get the floating beds installed,"" said Valentina with a nod. ""They'll make everyone feel more at home.""

Nora gave a noncommittal grunt, turning away from Valentina and toward her own desk. She set her bag down and opened it, extracting her tablet computer and a stylus.

She tapped the stylus against the screen of her tablet, then started typing. As her fingers flew over the keys, she heard Valentina's voice again.

""That's right, Nora. We'll have the new beds in place by this afternoon.""

Nora kept typing, though she hadn't finished her entry yet. ""Are we expecting any other colonists today?""

""No, no one else is coming."" Valentina stepped closer to Nora, leaning on the edge of her desk. ""But don't worry, I'll keep an eye out for anyone who might show up later.

The air smelled stale, like dust and rust, but there was nothing that could be done about it now. Nora inhaled deeply through a nostril while she walked, trying to clear her head so she wouldn't have to keep repeating this process later.

Nora's boots clunked on the metallic grating as she crossed the hallways. She passed several other colonists on their way to morning shifts in various stages of dressing. Some wore work clothes, others casual wear. Everyone had a purposeful look.

The corridors were long and straight, with no corners to hide places that might give an ambush advantage. Nora kept alert for any sign of danger, but saw none.

She stopped at the end of one hallway and turned left toward the communal showers. The entire colony was built around a central core where the dormitories, mess halls, and communal washrooms were located.

Nora paused in front of the door to her dormitory, listening carefully. She heard the faint sound of water running and people talking inside, but nothing else. No alarms sounded. There was no indication anyone was up and about yet. Nora took a deep breath, steeled herself, then knocked on the door three times.

""Come,"" called a voice from within.

Nora opened the door to find two women standing there. One woman was short with black hair, dark brown skin, and wide eyes. The other was tall, pale, and thin-limbed. Both wore simple clothing that looked like it had been worn a few too many times.

The shorter woman spoke first. ""Nora? You're on duty today?""

""Yes,"" Nora replied. She stepped into the room and stopped. The taller woman followed her in, closing the door behind her.

""What's wrong with you?"" asked the shorter woman.

""Nothing,"" said Nora. ""I'm just tired.""

Nora closed her eyes, trying to calm her pounding heart. She inhaled deeply through her nose and tried not to let the tension show in her face or voice. The other woman watched Nora closely, but didn't speak again.

Nora turned away from the other woman and headed for the showers. Her boots clunked loudly on the metal grating as she walked down the hallway. She passed several colonists heading to morning shifts, but no one gave her a second glance. They were all busy with their own tasks.

Nora entered the communal shower area. It was dimly lit, with only a few low-wattage bulbs hanging from the ceiling. The air smelled of soap and chlorine.

Nora stripped off her jacket and work boots and stepped into the warm water. She scrubbed her hair vigorously with a bar of soap, then rinsed it clean. She dried herself on an industrial towel that felt rough and scratchy under her skin.

276,0.5,0.7,1.0,72.0,4,48.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by recessed lighting panels set high up on the walls, but the hallway lights flickered more frequently than they did in the rest of the colony. The flickering only added to the general gloominess of the place.

Nora stopped at a bend in the corridor where she could see the command center ahead. A faint glow from the windowless building cast a pale orange sheen over the dark, sandy ground outside. In the darkness Nora could just make out the silhouettes of the buildings around her.

She glanced down the hall to the left, then the right, making sure no one was coming. Then she focused on the task at hand. She took off her gloves, pushed them into her pocket, and opened the door to the command center.

The door slid open with a soft hiss. Nora stepped inside without hesitation and closed it behind her. She turned on the lights, which flickered again as the power failed.

Nora paused in front of the large central desk, taking stock of her surroundings. There were four other people already in the room, three men and one woman. They all looked up when Nora entered. She nodded to each of them.

""Good morning,"" said the man who stood closest to the door, a short, balding fellow in a blue uniform. ""I'm Lieutenant Holman.""

Nora extended a hand. ""Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Nora Decker.""

Lieutenant Holman shook her hand firmly. ""Welcome aboard, Miss Decker. I'll be your supervisor until the others arrive. Please take a seat and we can get started.""

The lieutenant pointed toward an empty chair beside the desk. Nora sat down and strapped her tool belt around her waist before slipping on her gloves once more. She took a moment to check her hair and adjust her clothing.

As she worked, Nora tried not to think about what would happen if she failed. But the thought was always there. If the aliens found her, they'd kill her. The only reason she hadn't been killed yet was because the colony's AI had kept them from finding her.

The lieutenant watched Nora carefully as he spoke. He seemed to be waiting for something.

""Before we start,"" said the lieutenant, ""I wanted to let everyone know about a security issue that came up last night. We've got some bad guys out there and they're starting to make trouble.""

Nora frowned. ""What kind of trouble?""

The lieutenant glanced at her, then back at Nora. ""We don't have much information on this yet, but it looks like the Company is sending in a new team to investigate. They'll be here in two days.""

Nora nodded. ""That's good news. What else can you tell us?""

""Well, we don't know what their mission is exactly,"" said Lieutenant Holman. ""But I'm sure you've heard about the aliens who are living underground. We suspect they're the ones responsible for the attacks. The other colonists think so, too.""

Nora sighed. ""I guess. But why would aliens live underground? And how did they get there?""

The lieutenant shrugged. ""Nobody knows.

The colony's lights were low to conserve power, but the dimness made the hallways seem darker than they actually were. She took the time to make sure her hair was properly arranged, then entered the cafeteria.

The air conditioning hummed steadily, pumping in cold air to keep the room at a comfortable temperature. A handful of colonists sat around tables, eating their breakfasts. Nora saw several people already working on repairs.

She grabbed a tray from the nearest dispenser and loaded it with porridge, fruit, and milk. She spotted a few other engineers making similar trips, so she joined them.

As she ate her breakfast, Nora looked over the crowd of workers. Many wore tattered clothing that showed signs of wear. Some had bare arms and legs. Others still wore dirty coveralls stained with grease. They were tired.

Nora finished her meal and headed back to her quarters. She was halfway there when the alarm went off again. This time, Nora heard it clearly in spite of the racket in the hallway. It pulsed insistently, like a heartbeat. The sound sent shivers down her spine.

""What was that?"" she asked herself aloud. ""It sounded like people screaming.""

Nora quickened her pace, but the alarm remained silent. She left the cafeteria behind, wondering what could be wrong this time. Perhaps an explosion or fire?

The alarm must have malfunctioned already, she thought as she hurried to the command center.

Nora entered the large room, where the majority of the colonists worked during their shifts. She scanned the room for any sign of activity and found no one around. The only person in the room was the AI system. Eve.

Eve's voice echoed through the chamber as she spoke. ""Colonists, I am sorry to disturb your rest. But we are under attack. Be on alert for drones. If you see them, report immediately.""

Nora stared at the screen with wide eyes. She was confused. Why wasn't anyone else responding to the alarm?

""I'm coming,"" Nora said.

She ran out of the room and into the hallways, which were now filled with colonists running in every direction. Some headed toward the armory. Others sprinted toward the cafeteria.

Nora joined a group of workers who had already armed themselves and were heading for the cafeteria. She took off after them. The alarm was still blaring.

""What is going on?"" Nora asked a man beside her. He was dressed in dirty coveralls and wore an expression of utter confusion. ""The alarm hasn't stopped yet.""

He shrugged. ""It must be some kind of malfunction.""

Nora nodded, but she couldn't help feeling uneasy. The colonists' faces showed little emotion. They moved mechanically, like robots programmed to act on orders from the Company. All except for one woman, who was standing near the cafeteria doors.

278,0.5,0.8,1.0,73.0,5,44.0,"Nora paused by the entrance to the dormitories as she passed through them. The front door opened onto a long hallway lined with rows of doors. Each room was identical, containing only a bed, table, chair, sink, closet, and a small window looking out at the barren landscape beyond.

An older man sat on the end of one of the beds, reading the morning paper. He looked up when Nora walked past him, giving her a nod that seemed to say 'good morning'. She nodded back.

Nora turned down the hall toward the communal showers. She stopped outside the first one, glancing in as she did so.

The shower was empty.

She shook her head in disgust. No time to waste. Her shift started soon. Nora entered the shower, turning the water on full blast. Steam billowed around her. She stood still, letting the hot spray wash over her body.

After a few minutes the steam cleared, and Nora stepped out of the shower. She dried herself with a towel and dressed quickly. The cold air outside felt good as it rinsed the sweat from her face.

Nora glanced across the colony grounds. A pair of drones were patrolling the perimeter, their metallic bodies nearly invisible in the murky atmosphere. They made no sound as they moved along, but she could hear them breathing. Their long limbs and bulbous heads twitched as they scanned the area for threats.

This was the first day of Nora's new job. She had been assigned to the maintenance crew, where she would be responsible for troubleshooting equipment on a rotating schedule. She had only been working here a week, and already she was exhausted.

Nora walked through the main concourse toward the command center. It was located in front of the power plant, which sat at the heart of the colony. The power plant housed the fusion reactor that provided most of the colony's energy. Nora passed a row of shops and offices as she approached the command center.

The central concourse ran the length of the entire colony. On the left side, the corridor split into a T-junction at the entrance to the dormitories. The right branch led to the engineering bays.

Nora stepped up to the doorway leading to the command center, and paused before the security guards stationed there. She looked at the armed guards with suspicion as she put her hand on the scanner beside the door.

One of the guards nodded to Nora. ""Good morning, Ms. Decker.""

""Morning,"" said Nora. ""I'm on shift today.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" said the guard. He opened the door for Nora.

Inside, the command center was dimly lit and cool. The walls were covered in gray metal plates. The floor was a dull metallic grating. The ceiling was one large paneled pane of glass. A row of chairs lined the far wall, facing an old-fashioned desk.

Nora hesitated before sitting down in one of the chairs. It felt strange to be inside the command center.

A short, stocky woman walked up to her and extended a hand. ""Valentina Kern. I'll be your supervisor this shift.""

Nora shook Valentina's hand. ""Nice to meet you. I'm Nora Decker.""

""So, what's the first thing you're going to do?"" asked Valentina.

279,0.5,0.8,1.0,72.0,4,44.0,"The corridors were quiet as Nora made her way to the mess hall, where she found a line of colonists waiting at the counter for food. A small crowd gathered around the entrance to the recreation room as the door opened, but they quickly dispersed when Nora gestured for them to step aside. She took a seat at the end of the long table and waited for her order while she checked the time.

She'd been working in engineering too many hours lately, but there wasn't any other option available. The colony's power plant was down, leaving only emergency generators to run everything else. With the sun still low on the horizon, the lights wouldn't come back on until well after noon.

Nora ate her meal slowly as she watched the clock tick off seconds. She really needed to start keeping track of how much time she spent working, especially since she had no idea what kind of schedule the rest of the crew kept. But then again, who did?

As Nora finished her meal, the door opened and a tall, strong figure stepped inside. He wore a battered leather jacket over faded jeans, and even though he looked tired, his lean, chiseled face held a hint of smile that made Nora feel warm inside.

""Hey,"" she greeted him with a nod. ""You're up early.""

He leaned over the counter to kiss her cheek, and Nora felt her stomach flutter at the contact. She turned her head so their lips could meet instead of brushing past each other, feeling both nervous and excited.

""Good morning, love. Fancy meeting you here.""

His voice was low, husky, and rough, like he'd been running through a storm. His skin smelled lightly of soap, and Nora wondered if he washed often.

""Yeah,"" she said, smiling despite herself. ""I'm glad I got the shift. You want to go grab some breakfast?""

""Sure, but first..."" He trailed off as he ran a hand along her arm and then pulled it back quickly. Nora stared at him blankly.

""What's wrong?"" he asked, frowning.

Nora shook her head, confused. ""Nothing. I just... never mind. Let's get going."" She stood up and started for the door.

""Wait,"" he called. ""I'll be right behind you.""

She turned around, not sure what was happening. The man pushed past a couple of colonists heading toward the exit, and Nora followed him out to the main corridor. He stopped outside his quarters, where the colonists were gathering again.

""This is my last day off before this week,"" he told them. ""So I'll see you later.""

The colonists nodded, and one of them patted his shoulder. Nora watched him leave, then turned to face the others.

""I'm leaving too,"" she said.

They looked at her with surprise.

""You're quitting?"" asked one.

Nora shrugged. ""It looks like it.""

""How long have you been working here?"" another asked.

""Almost two years,"" Nora replied. Her voice was steady, but her heart beat fast. ""I'm an engineer.""

A few of the colonists exchanged glances, and several sighed.

""That's a bad job,"" said one. ""Engineers are always getting killed on these missions.""

Nora felt a chill run down her spine.

""Yeah, I know.

280,0.5,0.8,1.0,76.0,4,42.0,"The walk to the cafeteria felt long, but she made good time. The colonists'clothing was utilitarian and practical. Most items were manufactured for durability rather than style. She passed several other people in the hallways, who nodded at her as they walked.

The cafeteria was busy despite early morning hours. A few tables were occupied by colonists eating breakfasts while others stood around the serving counter. In the corner, a small group of colonists played cards while two other groups sat nearby, talking quietly.

Nora worked her way through the line until she reached the end of the counter. She picked up a tray and began to fill it with food from the shelves.

She had just finished loading her plate when someone tapped her shoulder, forcing her to turn. A tall man wearing a black coat was standing behind her. He smiled politely in greeting.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said. ""I'm Doctor Rael.""

Nora nodded stiffly and turned back to her food.

""Doctor?"" she asked.

""Yes. I work down in the labs. We're conducting some research on that new strain of flu you've been getting around lately.""

Nora frowned. ""That's not my job.""

He shrugged. ""No, but it is my job to keep an eye out for any potential problems. You've got a fever. And your blood pressure has spiked a little bit.""

""It's probably just a bug. It doesn't mean anything.""

""You don't have to worry about the flu, though. The Company's developed something that can help.""

Nora nodded again and continued to load her tray.

Rael moved away to fill his own plate. Nora watched him go, feeling uneasy. She glanced around the room, looking for security guards or other colonists who might be watching them. But nobody seemed to pay attention.

She finished loading her tray and took a seat at one of the few open tables in the cafeteria. As she waited for her food, the door opened. A man walked into the room carrying two trays. He set down one of the trays and turned to face Nora.

""Morning,"" he said. ""I'm Oscar. I'll be taking over your shift today.""

Nora nodded.

Oscar was a tall, thin man with dark skin, short black hair, and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a white lab coat over a buttoned shirt and trousers. He carried several large plastic bags filled with food.

""Good morning, Doctor Rael,"" Oscar said. ""Heard you had some trouble this morning.""

Nora shook her head.

""Just a bug. I'm fine now.""

Oscar nodded, but didn't seem too convinced. He placed his tray on the table and sat down across from her.

""Have you eaten yet?""

Nora shook her head. She hadn't even started.

""I'll get you something. You need to eat. It's not good for your health.""

Oscar stood up and walked away. Nora stared at him for a moment before she noticed the other colonists watching them. They all looked uncomfortable.

281,0.5,0.8,1.0,62.0,4,46.0,"The colony's corridors were crowded with colonists, many of whom stopped to stare at her as she passed them. She nodded politely in return, but didn't bother trying to make conversation. The Company had made it clear that colonists should keep their mouths shut unless spoken to.

She grabbed a handful of biscuits from the communal kitchen, then headed for the mess hall. As she walked through the crowded halls, Nora took note of the people around her. They were mostly young adults, though there was one elderly man and several teenagers who looked like they might be college students.

The colonists ate quickly and moved on to other tasks. Most of the colonists worked in shifts, so Nora didn't have to wait long before finding a table. She sat down next to an older woman with curly salt-and pepper hair. The woman smiled as Nora slid in beside her.

""Good morning, Nora,"" the woman said cheerfully. ""You're late.""

Nora frowned. She'd been up for a while already and hadn't seen anyone else. ""What time is it?""

The woman glanced at the clock. ""It's ten o'clock. You've got about an hour to get ready.""

Nora groaned. She was supposed to be in the gym in fifteen minutes. ""I'm not going to make my shift on time if I have to run around looking for a shower.""

""Don't worry, Nora. We'll find you one."" The woman patted her arm. ""Come with me. Let's go talk to someone.""

Nora followed the woman out of the mess hall. The halls were empty but the colonists had left their work behind; Nora could hear the hum of machinery and feel the vibration through the floor. The woman led Nora down a corridor, then into an office with a large window overlooking the main courtyard.

A man sat at a cluttered desk, reading from a tablet computer. He glanced up when he saw them enter. ""Good morning, Miss Decker. This is Dr. Mardick.""

""Morning,"" Nora said. The doctor was a slim man in his mid-thirties who wore glasses and a rumpled suit. His short hair was dark brown and slightly messy.

Mardick gestured to a chair. ""Please sit down.""

Nora slid into the seat across from him. ""Why am I here?""

""We're hoping you can help us out with some research."" Mardick pointed at the tablet computer on his desk. Nora looked over and saw a screen full of words, diagrams, and graphs.

""What is it?""

Dr. Mardick smiled. ""This is our colony's database. We're trying to figure out how the drones are getting through our security systems.""

Nora frowned. ""Drones? What kind of drones?""

The doctor glanced at her. ""I'm sorry, Nora. I should have explained this before we came in here."" He tapped a few keys on his tablet and the screen changed to show a diagram of a drone. Nora studied it for a moment. It looked like a cross between a beetle and a scorpion with a long tail.

""That looks like a bug,"" Nora said flatly.

282,0.5,0.8,1.0,74.0,5,45.0,"Nora paused in the hall to check her watch and found it broken. Not for the first time, she cursed her poor luck. She left her room and headed toward the mess hall where she could grab something quick before heading to work.

The halls were empty. The lights flickered and dimmed, but never quite went off. Nora made her way through the darkness, stepping over cracks in the floors and walls that had been patched together from different materials. A few meters later, Nora reached the end of the long corridor. She turned right at the intersection and approached a door with a small window.

A hand-written sign stood beside it reading: Dining Room.

Nora opened the door to find a short hallway lined by several doors on either side. She stepped inside, finding herself in another narrow corridor with two more doors leading off of it.

She walked down the corridor until she came to a large metal door. Nora pressed her palm against the scanner next to it, and the door slid open.

The dining room was spacious, filled with tables and chairs neatly arranged in rows. It had a high ceiling and windows overlooking the rocky landscape outside. A few lights glowed throughout the room.

Nora took a seat at one of the empty tables. She leaned back in her chair and looked around. The room was spotless. Everything gleamed.

Suddenly, she couldn't remember the last time she'd eaten anything. Her stomach growled. Nora pulled out her tablet and started tapping commands. Breakfast. She hadn't even thought about it.

At the top of the screen appeared a list of options with a count in each category. Nora selected a number, and the counter ticked up.

Her food arrived within seconds. A pair of plates and utensils were set on the table in front of her. She dug into the steaming meal, which tasted like nothing she had ever imagined.

The first bite made her gasp for air. The second made her eyes water. Nora pushed away the plate, wiping tears from her face with a napkin.

It was wonderful. This wasn't just food. It was sustenance.

She ate every scrap of it. When she finished the last bite, Nora licked her fingers clean. Her stomach rumbled again.

Nora stood and walked down the hall, heading toward the mess hall. She was almost there when she realized she had forgotten her tablet. A quick check revealed it sitting on a nearby chair.

Nora picked it up and checked the time. She still had half an hour before she needed to get to work.

She decided to take a short detour to the medical bay. It would be nice to see her friends. Nora stepped into the hallway and headed left, passing several closed doors until she reached one with a small window. She pressed her palm against the scanner next to it, and the door slid open.

The room inside was bright and warm. A few beds lined either side of the room, with more equipment lining the walls. Nora spotted a couple of people in the beds. They were asleep.

283,0.5,0.8,1.0,83.0,5,44.0,"The colony's dining hall was located near the power plant. It was a large open room filled to the brim with long tables, benches, and chairs. The tables were bolted to the ground with thick metal legs for stability; the benches were built from reinforced carbon fiber.

The colonists ate in shifts, so the dining hall was always packed. Nora paused at the entrance to peer inside, but the crowd was too dense to see the far end of the room. She sighed and shouldered her way through the sea of bodies until she reached the serving line.

A few people looked up as Nora approached. She smiled and waved to them, but didn't stop. A few of them called out greetings back. Nora passed a few more people on her way to the front.

She was relieved when the line moved quickly and she finally made it to the serving area. The server there recognized her and nodded. Nora took a tray and piled two crescent-shaped sandwiches on top of a smaller plate with a cup of milk.

""How are you this morning?"" the server asked. Her name tag read Wanda. She wore a light blue dress that matched her eyes and held a tray with identical food for every table.

Nora shrugged. ""I'm fine."" She had been awake since before dawn, but the caffeine in her coffee was enough to keep her going. ""You want to know if I'll be able to fix anything today.""

Wanda glanced at her schedule. ""Aye, Nora. You're up early for your shift.""

Her shift started at 0600 hours, which meant she'd already missed the last meal. Nora was glad it wasn't breakfast; her stomach growled.

The server returned with Nora's order and dutifully placed it on the counter in front of her. She tapped a panel next to the register screen to pay for Nora's food.

""Thanks,"" Nora said. She picked up the tray and headed back outside, where she found a seat on one of the benches.

She ate quickly. The food was delicious, but the lack of sleep combined with the early hour made her head swim. She felt like she could barely keep her eyes open.

After eating, Nora walked down the hall toward the dormitories. It would take her fifteen minutes to get there from here.

As she passed the agricultural section, a faint sound reached her ears. A low buzzing noise, almost mechanical but not quite, echoed through the air. She stopped and listened intently, trying to distinguish it.

""What is that?"" she muttered.

Nora frowned. She'd heard similar sounds before, but never so clearly. The drone grew louder and more distinct.

It was coming from the greenhouse.

Nora crept forward. She peeked around a corner and saw dozens of the aliens scuttling across the floor in a jumble. They were small, insectoid creatures with long antennae and two pairs of legs. Most of them wore utilitarian jumpsuits that looked like they came off a factory assembly line. Nora had seen them before, but only in pictures or video feeds.

284,0.5,0.8,1.0,95.0,5,47.0,"The hallway was cold and empty, the only sound the clink of her boots as she walked. The colony's power plant hummed at her back, and the ceiling lights flickered in the gusty wind outside. She shivered as she passed through a door, though not from the chill.

Cold air was preferable to hot, stale air.

Nora made her way past the communal showers, where other colonists were already washing away the grit of the day before. She paused briefly to check the time on the wall clock, then continued.

At the end of the hall, Nora entered the command center. Her breath frosted in front of her face as she stepped into the large room. She blinked against the cold, then rubbed her eyes.

The command center was a good place for a quick meal. She could get something to eat while she checked the status of equipment and tried to work out what the hell had happened last night.

The control panel was a cluster of lights and buttons that looked like it belonged in some other universe, but Nora knew better than to trust any of them.

She stepped up to the nearest console and started punching buttons, trying to activate various systems. A few lights flickered on, and she sighed in relief. It seemed her power loader was working again. She glanced around the room, still trying to figure out why her power loaders didn't start when she wanted them to.

The sudden chirp of the alarm startled her. She spun, looking at the clock behind her. The red numbers read 7: 30 AM. That couldn't be right. Nora wasn't due for another shift until 9 AM, and there were no scheduled alarms this early in the morning.

Then she saw the message blinking on the main display screen and froze.

An emergency alert system light flashed, and the screen displayed a message that was too garbled to make sense.

Nora stared at the words for several seconds before she realized what they meant. She turned and ran down the hall, her boots slapping against the floor as she sprinted.

Her heart pounded in her chest, but her mind was numb with shock and fear. She had to warn everyone about the aliens, or else...

The thought trailed off into silence. What would happen if she didn't warn them? Would the Company send more drones to kill them instead of simply ignoring their existence? Or would the Company just leave them alone, hoping that the colony's inhabitants would die out naturally?

Either way, the colonists were doomed. But she had to get back to her quarters and try to figure out what was going on. She couldn't stay here, not when she knew the Alphas were coming for them.

She reached the end of the hall, glanced at the clock, and ran faster. Her feet slapped against the flooring as she raced through the dark corridors. The sound echoed in the empty halls.

Nora didn't bother to check for cameras or security devices, she just kept running.

285,0.5,0.8,1.0,72.0,3,44.0,"The corridors were dimly lit by emergency lights that flickered when they weren't broken. The air smelled faintly of ozone from the nearby reactor, and dust clung to everything. A few colonists moved around in the hallways, but the majority slept off their shifts.

Nora's boots clicked on the floor as she walked toward the communal dining hall.

She passed a small recreation room where several people sat playing cards. As Nora approached, one of them looked up and stood. ""Morning,"" he said.

""Good morning.""

Nora nodded at the man who smiled back. He was tall and athletic with long dark hair and intense green eyes. He wore a tattered brown uniform with his sleeves rolled up.

The man held out his hand. ""I'm Corporal Ritchie, colony security.""

""Nice to meet you, Corporal. I'm Nora Decker. I'll be your engineer today.""

Ritchie nodded. ""Ah, yes, the new girl. I heard about that. You're going to make some changes?""

Nora shrugged. ""That depends on how well I do, doesn't it? In any case, I'll need to start with some diagnostic work. Can you show me around?""

He smiled. ""Sure thing. If we get a chance, maybe after lunch I'll take you out for a little ride. We have some wild places here.""

Nora raised an eyebrow. ""Really?""

""Oh yeah!"" He grinned. ""We've got caves and canyons and a few other things. Some of the colonists like to explore them. It's pretty cool.""

She nodded. ""Sounds great. Let me know when and where.""

""I will."" He paused. ""Are you from Earth originally? The Company told us that you were from somewhere else.""

Nora shook her head. ""No, I'm from New York City. But my family moved to California before..."" She trailed off. ""You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.""

""I know,"" he said quietly. ""It's okay. I just... I like to learn about people who aren't like me. It helps me understand what I am doing here.""

Nora smiled. ""Well, that makes sense. I guess I'm not used to being the odd one out.""

Ritchie chuckled. ""That's why you're new, isn't it? You'd better get started with your diagnostics. I'll see you later.""

""Thanks, Corporal. See you then.""

He nodded and returned to his game. Nora turned away and continued on toward the communal dining hall. The colony had no private eating facilities for employees, so the colonists ate together at long tables that filled the large room. Most of the colonists sat in silence while a few talked animatedly about their work or passed food around the table.

Nora took her place at the end of a row and waited for an open seat to become available. As she did, several people began to trickle out. She watched them leave, wondering where they went.

286,0.5,0.8,1.0,91.0,3,43.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by a single overhead bulb, but the way was clear. The colonists were up early this morning, as usual. She walked briskly past the dining hall, the mess, and the dormitories. At the end of the hall, she entered the engineering bay.

The air was hot and dry, making her sweat despite the chill in the room. When the door slid open, the noise of machinery and people rushed out at Nora like a wave. Workers paused their tasks to stare at her. Some gave her quick nods, others just stared.

She ignored them all as she headed for the power plant. Sully's office was down a short hallway to her right. The door was closed. Nora knocked lightly.

""Come in,"" came Sully's voice from within.

Nora opened the door and stepped inside. Sully sat behind a large desk with his back to her, reading reports through a set of thick glasses. He didn't look up when she entered.

""Good morning, Mr. Carmichael.""

He grunted irritably. ""Good morning, Ms. Decker.""

Nora took a deep breath. It was best not to rush him. She waited patiently in silence for several seconds until he finally looked up. His eyes were bloodshot, which she attributed to the stress of running an entire colony.

Sully leaned forward over his desk and folded his arms across it. ""I've been trying to get in touch with you all day.""

""Yes, sir,"" Nora said. She had no idea why Sully was so agitated about this; maybe he'd heard about her little incident last night. ""I'm sorry. I was asleep.""

""That's what I thought. You're here now. What do you need?""

Nora hesitated. ""Well... we have a problem with our power plant. We were hoping you could help us fix it.""

Sully sighed. ""Not today, Nora.""

""But...""

He held up one hand to cut her off. ""No buts. Not today.""

Nora bit back a retort and turned on her heel to leave. He wouldn't budge. She tried again. ""Sir, please—""

He slammed his fist down on the desk. ""What's wrong with you? I just told you we can't work on it today! Do you want to be replaced? Is that it?""

She stared at him. ""Are you serious?""

""Of course I am. If I don't give my engineers some downtime, they'll go crazy.""

Nora shook her head in disbelief. ""Mr. Carmichael, it's not like those drones are going to find us if we stay inside the power plant. They won't even know we're here!""

Sully paused for a moment, visibly struggling with his temper. Finally he took a deep breath and let it out slowly through pursed lips. ""I'm sorry, Nora. I can't take any chances. You understand? The power plant is too important.""

""But... but—""

He raised one finger. ""I'll get you back to work after lunch. Now go.""

Nora swallowed hard and left without another word. She walked away from him, fighting to keep her composure. Sully was right. She needed a break. But the thought of leaving him alone with his concerns made her feel sick.

She went back to her quarters instead and sat down on the bed.

287,0.5,0.8,1.0,80.0,5,42.0,"The corridors were cold and dark, the lights dimmed by the thick, dusty air. Narrow hallways stretched off to either side. Each corridor was lined with doors, each door filled with a sleeping occupant. The colonists were awake, but no one was stirring yet.

Nora reached the end of the dormitory wing, where she turned right. At the far end was the mess hall, the dining room, and the kitchen. She walked past the cafeteria, where she could smell fresh coffee brewing in the morning.

The kitchen was small and cramped with bright yellow walls. A few people sat at tables, waiting for their breakfasts to finish cooking. Nora headed straight through the kitchen, down a short hallway, and into the main dining area.

A long table dominated the center of the room. Around it, eight chairs stood ready. Nora took a seat in one of them, and waited as the cooks finished preparing the food.

The dining hall was quiet except for the clatter of metal plates being set onto the table. The cooks moved efficiently around the room, clearing away dirty dishes and putting on fresh ones. They were young women, tall and thin with angular faces. Their hair was black and cropped close to their heads.

Nora watched the cooks as they worked, her mouth watering at the smells of fresh bread and hot bacon.

One woman paused near Nora's chair. She had a pale face and dark brown eyes, and wore a simple white shirt and trousers. ""Good morning,"" she said politely.

""Morning."" Nora nodded back.

The woman returned to her work, setting down the plate of food she carried. As Nora ate, she noticed that the woman wasn't quite so tall as the others.

After the meal, Nora headed for the showers. The steamy rooms were spacious, with multiple showerheads and large glass walls. She stripped off the jacket and pants, and stepped into the first of several stalls.

The water felt good on her skin. Nora let it wash away sweat from the day before, then rinsed herself clean. After toweling dry, she put on a fresh uniform and walked out to meet the rest of her shift.

Nora was the second engineer in charge of the agricultural section. Her job included making sure the hydroponic greenhouses were kept running, monitoring waste processors for signs of failure, and keeping track of stored food and fertilizer.

When Nora arrived at her assigned workstation, Sully greeted her with a smile. ""Good morning, Nora. You're up early today.""

""I'm not usually this tired,"" she replied.

Sully chuckled. ""It's a long way from Earth. We'll be working hard here for years to come."" He gestured toward the station. ""You'll be doing some of your best work here.""

Nora nodded, but didn't meet his gaze. She felt awkward and uneasy, and knew that she was blushing.

Sully cleared his throat. ""Well, I have another project for you to tackle. It has been troubling me since yesterday.""

Nora's mouth went dry. ""What is it?""

288,0.5,0.9,1.0,87.0,5,46.0,"The corridors were quiet as she passed through them, the lights dimmed to sepia-toned twilight. The walls rippled slightly, reflecting her passage. When she came to the door of the mess hall, she paused for a moment, listening to the silence. A few minutes later, the clatter of utensils echoed from the other end of the hall.

Nora walked briskly toward the cafeteria, rushing to make up time. She was just in time to catch the early morning serving line that snaked its way around the room.

As Nora waited at the front of the queue, she settled her gaze on the colorful trays of food stacked high on the tables. Her stomach growled, but she restrained herself. She needed to save her energy for the long day ahead.

The line moved steadily forward as Nora worked through it, and soon the smell of fresh coffee wafted over her. The aroma helped ease her hunger pangs.

She reached the head of the line with a handful of steaming coffees and took her place in one of the two lines waiting to be served. She sat down on a stool at a counter, her back to the wall, and sipped her cup of coffee.

The first sip was always the best. The taste of the hot liquid warmed her throat and spread through her body like fire. It was easy to forget the harsh reality of their situation as she sank into the warm embrace of caffeine.

Nora glanced around the room, looking for familiar faces. She spotted Earl sitting alone at a table near the far end of the room. He was eating his breakfast, but he didn't look up when she saw him. Nora sighed and turned away from the counter.

Earl had been one of her friends since they were kids. She'd known him since she was eight. They'd grown up together, and now that she was an adult, they still shared the same work schedule. But after a few years of working together, the other members of the colony started to avoid her. She knew why.

Nora wasn't just smart, she was also a woman. She worked hard, and no one wanted to get on her bad side. And there was something else about her, too. Something that made people uneasy.

Nora sipped more of her coffee and tried not to think about it.

After finishing her cup of coffee, she returned to the kitchen area to help with cleanup. It was a grueling job, but Nora loved cooking and cleaning. She had a real knack for it.

She helped clean up the mess hall, then moved through the corridors toward the command center, where she would be stationed during her shift.

The sound of the alarm woke Nora from a restless sleep. She blinked her eyes open and rolled out of bed, pulling on clothes as she ran down the corridor to the comm room. The alarm's chirping echoed off the walls, drowning out the sounds of the colony around her.

289,0.5,0.9,1.0,80.0,4,43.0,"The hallways were dimly lit by emergency lighting, but the colonists made up for the lack of sunlight by keeping their doors open. The hallway was empty, so Nora walked past the kitchen, dining room, recreation area, and library without seeing anyone else. She passed several other rooms before reaching the dormitory.

The corridor opened into the main communal space for the colonists. A few people sat at tables eating breakfast or working on computers. Nora peeked in the door to see if she could spot Valentina, then headed toward the common kitchen.

Breakfast was a simple affair of porridge, eggs, toast, and juice. Nora grabbed a slice of peach-colored fruit from a bowl along with a cup of orange juice and took her tray to one of the long tables.

A young man sat across from her, tapping away on his tablet computer. He wore a thin, short-sleeved shirt and pants that looked soft and comfortable. His brown hair hung in loose curls around his face, framing his eyes and making him look boyish despite the fact he was probably older than her.

Nora smiled as she approached the table. ""Good morning.""

""Morning,"" the man said, looking up from his screen. He lifted a hand in greeting. ""I'm Nick.""

""Nice to meet you, Nick. I'm Nora.""

He nodded and returned to his work. Nora bit back a smile. She wasn't sure why she found it so funny. Maybe it was the way he'd greeted her with an awkward wave.

Nick had a chiseled physique, but his face was round and friendly. He was tall and thin but not painfully skinny. The lines of his body were graceful and well-defined, though they lacked the hard angles of a military man. He was handsome in a relaxed, easygoing sort of way.

The colonists here weren't like those on Earth. They didn't seem to have any sense of style or fashion. Nora felt self-conscious about her own clothes, which looked plain and practical.

She glanced at her tray. Her porridge was still warm. It smelled delicious. She couldn't remember the last time she'd eaten breakfast.

""You eat this every morning?"" she asked, picking up a forkful of eggs. ""It's good.""

Nick gave her a wry smile. ""I've been doing my best to keep myself healthy,"" he said. ""But it's mostly just because I don't know how long we'll be stuck here.""

Nora frowned. She hadn't thought about that part. But Nick was right. The Company had sent them out here on a one-way trip. How long would they stay? And what if they got stranded for good?

Nick finished his work and put down his tablet. He placed it in the holder on his tray. Then he looked up at Nora.

""How's your shift going?"" he asked.

Nora shrugged. ""Not bad. We're getting through most of our routine maintenance now.""

""Good, I'm glad to hear it,"" Nick said.

He glanced at her, then away. His eyes lingered on her hands. She followed his gaze and saw they were dirty from handling the tools of her trade.

""You're a mechanic?"" he asked.

She nodded.

290,0.5,0.9,1.0,87.0,4,48.0,"The corridor outside her room was dark. Nora paused at the door to double-check that the lights were off, then slipped quietly along the hall toward the communal showers. The dim lighting cast long shadows across the smooth metallic floors and walls.

She reached the end of the hallway, where the first row of doors opened onto a small recreation area. Here, the colonists played games, watched holovids, or worked on projects. A few people sat scattered around playing cards while others read or studied books. Nora saw no one else in the vicinity.

As she passed through the opening to the showers, the sound of running water echoed from the distant caverns. The steamy mist that rose from the hot waters felt good against her skin. Her hair was still wet when she stepped out again, but Nora didn't care.

The fresh air tasted crisp and invigorating after so much time inside. She breathed deeply, feeling her aching muscles loosen up.

Nora wasn't sure what kind of game was being played at the table in the recreation center. The players were too busy making bets and laughing to notice that they had company. Nora walked over and leaned on the wall beside them, observing their play.

""I'm going to win this hand,"" a man said with confidence. He held a stack of chips. ""I'll bet everything I've got.""

The woman next to him laughed. She was younger than the other two men, with dark brown hair pulled back into a ponytail.

""That's not how it works,"" she told the man. ""You have to put down a minimum amount of money before you can bet anything.""

""But I want to win!"" the man protested. ""I'll lose my shirt if I don't. You know that.""

""No, you won't,"" the woman retorted. ""You'll lose your shirt anyway, because you're a fool. You think that just because you have a lot of cash on hand you can gamble away everything? If you do that, you'll be broke when the Company comes to collect. And then they'll dock your pay for being late.""

""It doesn't make any difference,"" he argued. ""If I win, I'll get paid. If I lose, I still get paid. It's not like I'm actually losing anything.""

The woman rolled her eyes. ""Look, man, you don't really understand how this game works. Let me show you what happens if you try to pull something like that.""

She stood and walked over to the table, where she placed a five chip stake on top of the pile. Then she sat back down again.

The other two men looked up in surprise. They'd been watching Nora too closely, but they didn't see anything wrong with the woman's actions.

""I'm going to win this hand,"" she said confidently.

""What are you doing?"" one of them asked. He was young and blond, his face flushed from the heat of the room. ""You can't do that!""

Nora smiled. ""Why not? You just saw me put down a bet. Now you have to make it.""

""But..."" The man looked at the woman. She shrugged.

291,0.5,0.9,1.0,80.0,5,46.0,"The dormitory hallways were dimly lit by glowing strips along the walls, belying their age and disrepair. The lights flickered sporadically, casting shadows that danced across the rows of doorways and other colonists'beds.

The air smelled like stale sweat, food, and disinfectant. Nora wrinkled her nose as she walked past a row of bathrooms that had once been pristine but now sported peeling paint and scuffed floors. She passed the communal showers where the water pressure was so low it felt more like a trickle than anything else.

Nora's boots crunched on gravel as she stepped outside to the courtyard. She shivered at the chill in the morning air, which was just beginning to turn from night to day. A few colonists still slept soundly under blankets with their heads buried in pillows. One or two hurried off for work, though the majority lingered over cups of coffee and food.

She made her way through the camp toward the mess hall, passing a few colonists who were already awake and working on breakfast. Nora greeted them as they went about their business, but none responded. She shrugged it off and continued onward, not wanting to make any unnecessary noise.

The mess hall was an open space that looked out onto the courtyard. Its walls were lined with tall booths and tables. A huge stainless steel oven warmed the room, and steam rose from the plates of food piled high on the counters.

The colonists had a long tradition of eating together. It was a time when everyone could relax and get acquainted. Nora paused at the entrance to see if anyone was waiting for her, but no one seemed to notice she was there. She took a seat at the end of the counter closest to the door and waited.

A few minutes later, another engineer appeared. He wore his hair slicked back into a tight ponytail, which emphasized his angular face. His eyes were dark brown and alert, and he carried himself with confidence.

Nora smiled and waved him over. ""Good morning, Mr. Carmichael.""

Sully nodded and sat down next to her. ""Morning, Nora. How was your sleep?""

""Fair. I'm going to grab some breakfast before my shift starts.""

""I think you'll find the food here is better than what the Company provides,"" Sully said. ""We have a private chef who comes out once every few days. We're lucky to get it.""

""That's good to hear. I like eating well when I can.""

""You'll be working with the new guy today, right? The one from Alpha Centauri?""

""Yes. He's got a lot to learn, but he seems smart enough. And he's eager to learn, so I'm sure he'll catch on quickly.""

""He should. This job isn't easy, and we don't get many people willing to take it. It's not just the danger, either. You'll need to know how to repair everything around here, and there are a lot of things to keep track of. But if he makes mistakes he won't make them twice.""

292,0.5,0.9,1.0,94.0,3,43.0,"The hallways were lit by dim red lights spaced at intervals along the wall. The ceiling was high, but the hallway itself seemed small—like a prison corridor. She walked quickly, scanning for the communal showers along one side, then turned right to go around a corner and head for the cafeteria.

Ahead of her, two men in dark blue uniforms stood outside the door to the cafeteria, blocking her path. They held rifles slung over their shoulders with grips down, arms straight out from the body.

Nora stopped just short of them. ""Excuse me?""

One man looked up. His eyes were black and glittered like obsidian chips. He stared at Nora, unblinking.

""Can I help you, miss?""

She swallowed hard. Her heart pounded. She was not afraid of these men. But her mind screamed that she needed to be.

The other guard took a step forward. He spoke, and his voice sounded familiar.

""Nora Decker.""

Her name. It had been years since anyone called her that, but he knew it. She was sure of it.

He reached out with a gloved hand and pulled back the hood on a blue helmet. A strange, bulbous shape covered his face, and he wore goggles over his eyes. The man's nose and mouth were obscured behind the mask.

""I'm sorry... what?""

The second guard stepped closer, but the first one kept his distance.

""Nora Decker,"" the man repeated. ""My name is Harkness. I'm an officer with the Company. We're looking for you. You and your father.""

Nora felt a chill run down her spine. She couldn't think about anything else.

""What's going on?"" she asked, staring at him. ""Where's my dad? Is he okay?""

Harkness glanced over Nora's shoulder, then said something to his partner. The other guard nodded and moved aside.

""We'll take you to him now.""

Nora shook her head. Her mind was racing, trying to process everything that had happened.

""No! I want to talk to him first!""

The two guards exchanged looks. One of them held up his hands placatingly.

""All right, fine. But we need you to come with us.""

He gestured toward the cafeteria door. Nora realized they wanted her to leave the colony before anyone saw her.

She hesitated, then turned and ran.

The hallways were empty. She should have been able to slip away unnoticed—but the guards caught her before she'd gone five meters. They grabbed her arms and yanked her back.

""Let me go!""

Nora struggled futilely, but their grip was too strong. She couldn't break free even if she wanted to.

They marched her into a small room and pushed her down onto the floor.

293,0.5,0.9,1.0,78.0,4,46.0,"The colony's power plant was at the heart of the complex, its squat central tower surrounded by a ring of smaller buildings that supported the rest of the complex. The building housing the main reactor was impressive; the turbine hall was huge, and the entire structure seemed to be built around the machinery. That said, the power plant was utilitarian and practical, not beautiful.

Nora found Sully in the command center, wearing a hard hat, standing over the tactical display that showed the layout of the colony. Nora stopped on her way to the galley and leaned against the wall beside him to watch.

The tactical display showed the topographical map of the area, with the colony spread out below them. Nora felt a twinge of unease as the image shifted from green to red, revealing the location of the drones. A swarm of ten drones was moving toward the colony.

Nora frowned. ""What are you doing?""

""Watching,"" Sully replied, without looking up.

Nora took a step closer, watching the display carefully, then another. ""You're making me nervous.""

Sully glanced at her with a faint smile. He rotated his wrist, and the display changed color to show the location of the colonists' defensive armory. ""I'm not supposed to do that. But I've been waiting for this.""

Nora nodded. ""We need to get our weapons back. And we can't let the aliens know that we know they're there.""

""Yes, but what if they find out anyway? What then?"" Sully asked.

""Then I guess we fight them,"" Nora said. She reached to tap the tactical display, but Sully held up a hand to stop her.

He gave her a wry smile. ""That's the problem with this place. You have no idea how many people want it or how much money is involved. If we don't take care of these things, who will?""

""So you just wait until the Company sends a ship full of executives in their best suits and then you attack them."" Nora shook her head. ""If we're going to do something, now would be better than later.""

Sully rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""Yeah, maybe."" He paused. ""But if I do it right, no one will ever know.""

Nora regarded him with a frown. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm going to make sure that the drones won't return,"" Sully replied. ""And they'll never know why.""

Nora stared at him, her mouth open. She'd heard of this technology before, but she'd always assumed that it was classified. But Sully wasn't wearing a hard hat; he must have access to the schematics.

""You can't do this,"" Nora said quietly. ""They'll fire on us if they see what you're doing.""

Sully raised an eyebrow. ""Why? I'm not hurting anyone. And even if they did shoot, so what?""

""It's wrong!"" Nora hissed.

294,0.5,0.9,1.0,84.0,4,42.0,"The air outside was cold and crisp, despite the morning sun. Beyond the dormitory walls, the colony's power plant loomed like a giant fusion reactor in the distance. The faint hum of its cooling systems filled the spaces around it, along with the thrumming of machinery from the garage and engineering bays.

Nora shivered as she walked toward the cafeteria. She had little appetite, but needed to eat something. As she passed the large dining hall, she paused and glanced inside. It was empty except for several colonists sitting at the tables. They were dressed similarly to Nora, though they wore more practical clothes instead of the fanciful costumes.

Nora continued on as if nothing caught her attention, but halted abruptly when she noticed one of them. Her heart raced in her chest and her stomach twisted with nausea.

A young man sat alone at a table near the back of the room, his head bent over a book. He looked up as Nora approached and immediately stood when he spotted her. His eyes widened in shock.

She couldn't move. She just stared at him, unable to think.

The young man's face was pale, almost gray under the dim lighting. A thin layer of dust covered his dark brown hair. He was tall and lean with a narrow frame, but broad shoulders and long arms. The jacket hung open, revealing an olive green shirt beneath.

Nora felt like she'd been punched in the gut. She took a step backward, but the space between them was too small for anything else. The young man hurriedly pulled his book closed and tucked it into a pocket.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora said. ""I didn't mean to startle you.""

He raised his hands defensively, palms out. ""No problem. I just... I didn't expect anyone here this early.""

Nora nodded and tried to smile. She wanted so badly to ask what he was doing in the cafeteria, but she couldn't bring herself to. How could such a stunningly attractive man be sitting alone in the middle of nowhere?

His gaze flickered down to her feet, then back up. He cleared his throat nervously. ""Can I help you?""

She hesitated for a moment before speaking again. ""Yes. Is there anything I can get you?""

""No, no! I'm fine."" His eyes darted around the room, but he still seemed unnerved. ""Really.""

Nora forced a smile. ""Okay. Well, if you need anything..."" She trailed off awkwardly, not knowing what else to say.

The young man lifted his chin in a nod and turned away.

Nora watched him walk toward the front of the room, where several colonists were gathered at one of the long tables. He glanced over his shoulder once more, meeting Nora's gaze briefly. Then he disappeared through the double doors leading to the garage and engineering bays.

Nora felt dizzy from being so close to him. Her heart pounded in her chest, but she couldn't move. She wanted to follow him, see what he was doing. But she couldn't think of any excuse for it. Besides, she had work to do.

She shook her head and began walking again. A few minutes later, Sully emerged from the cafeteria. He spotted Nora and waved.

""Hey, Nora!""

She returned the wave, though she kept walking.

295,0.5,0.9,1.0,72.0,5,44.0,"The dormitory's common room was already full of colonists at their morning meal. The colonists were dressed in the same utilitarian clothing Nora wore, but the differences showed. They were leaner than Nora, darker skinned, and shorter. Their eyes were less green and more brown.

The colonists ate in silence, breaking off conversations briefly when she entered. Most of them gave her a quick glance, then returned to eating. Nora took the seat farthest from the door. She sat down, trying not to feel like a stranger among friends.

She didn't recognize anyone.

Nora had been born on Earth, but the Company that ran this colony had sent her out here to save it, so they could later send her back home. But now she'd become one of these people, who lived in the dirt and cold, even if just for a few months. She was only a month into her contract.

A few months ago Nora would have felt more awkward about the situation. Now, having survived the first ambush, she felt more confident. And hungry.

The colonists finished eating, and Nora stood up to leave. The colonists went back to their rooms or work duties without another word. Nora headed down the hall toward the communal showers.

The colonists were right about breakfast. As Nora approached the showers she saw a line of ten colonists waiting in front of the open door, each of them wearing a similar set of clothes. Each person was tall and lean with dark skin and black hair. They looked more like a group of gymnasts than a bunch of engineers.

Nora took her place at the end of the line, which stretched out into the corridor. She pulled off her jacket and hung it on a hook, then turned to face the other colonists. The shower room was a large square, dimly lit space with an opaque wall of glass slatted in a grid. A pair of metal doors led into the showers themselves.

""Good morning,"" Nora said, smiling politely. ""I'm sorry I'm late. My shift started early.""

The colonists glanced at her, then returned their attention to the glass walls. Some of the colonists didn't bother looking at Nora. Others stared openly, their eyes hard and unblinking.

Nora swallowed nervously. This was her first time meeting the colonists in person. She'd done her research, but none of the colonists had ever met her.

She felt a sudden urge to run away. The colonists were dangerous. And they weren't human.

A man with long black hair and pale skin stepped forward from the crowd. He walked slowly through the line, staring at Nora. His eyes glittered like pieces of polished obsidian.

He stopped before her and extended his hand. ""Hello, Nora. I'm Rafe.""

Nora took the offered hand, feeling its callused texture. She held it for a moment, then shook it firmly. ""Nice to meet you, Mr. Zarek. You're the colony's chief engineer, right?""

Rafe nodded. His voice was low, with a hint of an accent. ""Yes, I am. Do you know why we've gathered here today?""

""No, sir.

Nora passed through the gloomy halls, heading for the mess hall. She heard voices coming from one of the rooms at the end of the hallway. Curious, she peeked around the corner to catch a glimpse of someone sitting near a table.

The room was small, with only one desk and two chairs. A man sat behind the desk while another person stood beside him, leaning over the desk to speak with him. Both wore grey jumpsuits that clung tightly to their bodies.

Nora stepped back into the hall, feeling exposed in the tight space, but could see no sign of a door. She turned and saw the other person had left.

The man at the desk looked up as Nora approached, his eyes shining bright green. His hair was black, short, and spiky. He smiled broadly at her.

""Good morning, Nora,"" he said in a deep voice. ""I'm Dr. Samuels.""

Nora nodded politely.

""Can I help you?"" he asked.

She shook her head. ""No, thank you. I just wanted to say hello. It's my first day.""

He chuckled. ""You're lucky. This is my third shift. We've already got a full house. But don't worry, we'll get everyone fed.""

Nora gave him a nervous smile and began to walk away, when she heard the click of heels on metal. Turning around, she saw another woman approaching.

This one was tall with long, straight, dark brown hair held back in a ponytail. The woman wore a white lab coat over her uniform, and carried a clipboard in her hand. Her face was pale and thin, framed by a mop of curly red hair. She was wearing dark sunglasses.

""Dr. Samuels,"" the woman said, nodding to him. ""Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to speak with me.""

""Of course. Please, come in."" He gestured toward his office. ""We're almost finished here. I'll be done soon.""

Nora followed them into the narrow room. Dr. Samuels closed the door behind her and turned to Nora.

""So, you're our new engineer?"" he asked.

She nodded.

""Where are you from?""

Nora glanced at the woman standing beside him. She had an intense gaze and a strong jawline.

""Earth,"" she said.

He smiled at her. ""You must have been excited when you got this assignment.""

Nora shrugged. ""I'm not really sure what I expected. It's hard to say. All I know is it sounds exciting.""

The woman laughed. ""It is. You're in for a treat, Nora.""

Samuels clapped his hands together gleefully. ""Let me introduce you to my partner, Dr. Susan Carter.""

Carter stepped forward and offered her hand to Nora.

Nora chose a table near the middle of the room, next to a window overlooking the rocky landscape. Her gaze lingered on the ragged cliffs as she sat down. She made herself wait until everyone else arrived before taking a seat.

The colony's cafeteria was filled with many people, most of whom came from the dormitories. Everyone seemed to be talking as they gathered around their tables. Nora caught snippets of conversations about weather, work assignments, and the latest discoveries in the surrounding area.

Nora munched on some stale bread and drank water while waiting for her food. She listened closely as people spoke with interest about the recent discovery of a new cave system. A few minutes later, an older man at the opposite end of the room approached Nora's table. He had a white beard that extended down to his chest, and he wore faded jeans and boots.

""Good morning,"" said the old man. ""I'm Travin.""

He extended a hand across the table, but Nora didn't shake it. Instead, she stared at him in surprise.

Travin nodded. ""I know I look like a scarecrow. It's because I spend my days up on the surface. That's where we found the cave.""

Nora's gaze shifted to his beard. The cuticles of his hands were thickly wrinkled, and Nora couldn't see any visible veins in his skin.

""We're not sure what the aliens are doing down there. We haven't been able to get close enough to find out. But whatever it is, they've got a lot of eggs. Thousands of them.""

The old man paused as he watched Nora process this information. His eyes twinkled with humor. ""If you want to go, I'll give you a lift. Just let me know when you want to leave.""

Nora grinned at him. ""Thanks, Travin. I'll think about it.""

""Okay."" He smiled back. ""See ya around, Nora.""

Nora finished her breakfast and returned to work after a few minutes of thought. She was halfway through the morning shift when the alarm went off again. Nora groaned and shoved herself from her chair.

She ran to the kitchen, where she found an older woman stirring something in a pot over a small stove. The woman looked up at Nora with tired eyes.

""Morning, Nora,"" said the woman. ""You're late.""

Nora nodded. ""I'm sorry. I overslept. What's for breakfast?""

""Oatmeal. It'll be ready soon.""

""Sounds good. Thanks.""

Nora left the kitchen and walked down a short hall to the dormitory. The room was large enough for twenty people, but it only had twelve beds, so half of them were empty.

She approached the door to a kitchen and paused for a moment, trying to decide if she wanted to take her time eating alone or risk disturbing others by rushing in.

She decided on the latter option. The Colonists' Council insisted that colonists eat together, but Nora had trouble relating to people she'd met just hours ago. On top of that, her stomach grumbled at the thought of food. She couldn't remember the last time she ate.

Nora slipped through the doorway, stepping into a room that looked like it should have been filled with breakfast smells cooking. Instead of the familiar scent of eggs frying in butter and bacon sizzling in oil, however, Nora found herself staring at a table holding a partially eaten tray.

""Hello?""

A young woman sat in one of the chairs, looking up from a plate of half-eaten scrambled eggs. She had pale skin and dark brown hair. Her eyes were large, black, and heavily lashed, framed by long lashes and wide cheekbones. They stared blankly into space as she chewed and swallowed her mouthful of food.

Nora froze for a moment. Then, after a deep breath, she said in a low voice, ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.""

The woman continued chewing while looking at Nora over the rim of her mug. She wore a faded T-shirt with the words 'Shut Up' on the front.

""Are you... are you okay?"" Nora asked, unable to look away from the other woman's face. She felt an uncharacteristic urge to pull back, but the hunger was too strong.

The stranger finished chewing and swallowed before answering. ""Sure. Why wouldn't I be?""

Nora looked down at her own hands, which were clenched into fists. Her grip tightened around a fork. She brought it up to her mouth and began eating the eggs under the table without tasting them.

After a moment, Nora sighed. ""Sorry. I've been here for about three weeks now. Everyone treats me like one of them. I haven't seen anyone else since I arrived.""

""Yeah. That's understandable,"" said the woman with a shrug. She set her empty mug on the table and folded her arms. ""I guess you're pretty new. How long have you worked for the Company?""

""Three years. Before that I did a stint as a geologist.""

The woman nodded. ""That sounds interesting. Maybe you could show me some time. You know, if you don't mind. I'd love to hear more about your work. And maybe we can even get together tonight after shift and go out on the town. Grab dinner, drink some beers. Whatever you want. I'm sorry I scared you.""

""It's okay. Really.""

299,0.6,0.4,1.0,77.0,5,48.0,"The main corridor was quiet as Nora walked past closed doors and silent passageways. The colony kept quiet at night, but the rest of this section was a hive of activity during the day. Energized colonists moved about their various tasks, chattering occasionally in low tones.

She passed by one particular door where she heard voices raised in argument. She slowed her pace, listening carefully. After a moment's delay, the sound of a fist banging against the wall echoed through the hallway. A few seconds later, the door opened and two men came out. One man was tall and lean with dark hair and a short beard. He wore loose black trousers and a dark gray tunic. His skin looked pale, almost translucent.

The other man was shorter and heavier than the first. His face had been shaved smooth except for a small patch of stubble above his upper lip. His eyes were dark and his mouth full in a beaklike nose. He wore a light blue uniform, complete with epaulets and shiny insignia.

With them was another man wearing military fatigues and carrying an assault rifle. It was a large weapon like a futuristic submachine gun, but it sported three barrels instead of just one. The man held the weapon across his chest in both hands, making him look even more intimidating.

Nora waited until the four men turned down a different corridor before approaching them. They ignored her as she walked up to the group. Her boots clanged against the metal flooring, echoing loudly.

""I'm sorry,"" Nora said with a tentative smile. ""We're new here and don't know much about how things work.""

The man with the assault rifle gave Nora a quick once over, then returned his attention to the two men. ""You've got five minutes to get your asses back in there. If you can't do it, I'll have you escorted back to your quarters and we'll start over tomorrow at zero hour.""

The shorter man frowned. ""Five minutes? That's not enough time for us to explain what the problem is. We should be given more—""

""No."" The soldier fired a glance toward the door. ""That's an order. Now move!""

One of the men looked like he was going to argue. ""We need to discuss this—""

The soldier raised his rifle. ""Move!""

With a final glare, the man turned on his heel and marched away down the hall. The other two followed him in silence. At the end of the hallway, they hesitated, looking back for a moment before turning around and disappearing into one of the doors.

Nora watched them go, her fingers rubbing along the holster at her hip. Her pulse raced. She didn't know these people, but she knew something was wrong.

The four men reappeared in a few minutes, walking past Nora without acknowledging her presence. They passed through an intersection where a pair of colonists were unloading supplies from a supply truck. As far as Nora could tell, the crewmembers were just doing their jobs.

She waited until the two workers had finished loading crates onto a cart and wheeled it off. Then she caught up with the four men again.

""Hey! Wait for me!""

Nora hurried to catch up, glancing back every so often to make sure the two men hadn't decided to turn around and chase after her. The smaller one glanced over his shoulder at her, then seemed to notice her following them again. He turned back, frowning.

""What are you doing?"" he asked.

300,0.6,0.4,1.0,79.0,5,42.0,"Nora made her way along the hallways to the mess hall, a utilitarian concrete room with long tables bolted to the floor. The walls were adorned with tool racks, industrial lockers, and the occasional piece of equipment she could use in her work. A few colonists lounged at the tables, chatting idly as they ate their breakfasts.

Nora filled her plate from the selection of food on offer, then grabbed a seat next to one of the diners. She sat down facing him. ""Hey,"" Nora said with a smile.

""Morning, Nora,"" he replied politely. He glanced at her plate. ""Are you eating?""

She nodded. ""Yeah.""

He looked over his shoulder to the other side of the room where two women were filling their plates behind him. One smiled shyly when she caught Nora's eye.

Nora returned her attention to the man beside her. ""So, what are we doing today? I thought we might head back down into town and crash a party or something.""

The man frowned. ""I was kind of hoping we'd be able to get in some training time before shift. We've been working hard lately, but our last session was yesterday afternoon. It'll take us until tomorrow night just to catch up on everything we haven't trained for yet.""

Nora grimaced. ""Oh yeah, right... Sure. That sounds good. Just let me grab my boots first.""

""Thanks,"" he said lightly, as if it were nothing.

Nora paused at the door to the mess hall, her stomach rumbling in anticipation of breakfast. She made her way into the hallway, turned left, and headed towards the workshop. An old-fashioned elevator took her down several levels to the workshop. Nora stepped out onto a landing, then walked along the metal catwalk to an access ladder leading further down.

She descended the ladder until she reached the bottom floor. The workshop was a vast, cavernous space lined with tables and work benches. Chimneys stuck up here and there like stalagmites. At the far end, the room was illuminated by a large window that looked out over the colony.

Nora pushed through the doors into the workshop, where her fellow colonists worked. A few dozen of them bustled about as they performed maintenance on equipment set up around the main lab. Nora spotted Director Chen sitting behind a desk at the front of the room.

Chen smiled when Nora entered, keenly aware of Nora's presence among her workforce. ""Good morning, Nora!""

""Morning, Doc,"" Nora replied cheerfully. She kept walking towards the director's desk.

Chen stood as Nora approached and offered her hand. Nora shook it firmly, tugging aside the sleeves of her jacket to expose a patchwork-covered arm. ""How are you feeling?""

""Fit, thanks."" Nora grinned. ""I'm ready for another shift in the field, but I'd rather get some training going first.""

Chen nodded. ""Yes...

301,0.6,0.4,1.0,74.0,4,45.0,"The corridors were dim. The colonists had long since turned off the lights for their own comfort. In the early morning darkness, Nora could see her breath as she walked. She rubbed her arms to ward off a chill. As she passed through the dormitories, bleary eyes watched her from behind dark glasses. Some of them stood in silence, but many others called out greetings.

""Morning, Nora. Sleep well?"" A man's voice echoed up the corridor. He sounded like he was laughing.

""Yeah,"" Nora replied. ""Fine.""

She kept moving as if she didn't care what any of them said. Other voices joined the first.

""You guys always have a rough night, huh? We can go back to sleep if you want. No one needs to know.""

Nora ignored the comments. She needed to get away from the dormitory halls and find food. But where would she go, when there was no place else to go?

The cafeteria was closest. It sat at the end of the residential area. Nora knew it from her childhood. Her parents and grandparents had brought her here with them every day.

As she approached, Nora heard laughter and saw people already gathered in the dining hall. On the other side of an open portal stood a narrow counter lined with row upon row of white trays. The kitchen staff worked fast, filling plates from the conveyor belt while customers chatted among themselves.

People looked up as Nora passed. They waved or called out greetings. Some who could see her waved back. She smiled and nodded to them all but kept on walking.

Nora was hungry.

The trays were stacked high with food. She grabbed one and lugged it to the only free table, a plastic bench near the entrance. The tray held a breakfast burrito smothered in a thick paste of eggs and salsa. A dash of hot sauce finished off the dish.

Nora sank into the seat and began devouring the meal, pausing only to drink half her glass of water. Crumbs scattered across the tabletop. Nora wiped them away with one hand and pushed the empty tray aside with the other.

A couple of people glanced over at her, but they didn't say anything. Nora kept eating. She was ravenous.

The trays kept coming. Nora's stomach growled and complained. But she fought down the hunger pangs, pushing food past her lips.

She ate until her stomach felt full. Then her body demanded more fuel. Nora paused for a few seconds to lean back in her chair and catch her breath before reaching for another burrito.

As long as she didn't look up, nobody would notice if she stopped. And there was nothing to do but eat. There wasn't much to be done about the food shortage. Not yet anyway. The Company had sent a supply ship every week. It was due again in a couple of days.

Nora finished the burrito and drank some more water. She shoved the tray aside, stood, and walked toward the exit. If she got stuck here, she'd starve to death. To hell with it.

302,0.6,0.4,1.0,68.0,5,43.0,"At first there were few people about. A couple of colonists worked on the top of the reactor building, and a small group of men gathered around the mess hall. Nora passed them without looking at their faces, but caught snippets of conversation.

She paused outside the mess hall. The door stood open and she could hear raised voices inside. She peeked in through the crack.

Three Company managers sat at one table, arguing loudly over food supplies. One was Sully Carmichael, the colony's primary administrator. Another wore the uniform of a Company executive. And the third man had the angular, sharp features of an older man. He appeared to be a scientist or engineer judging by his work clothes.

Carmichael and the other two men were talking about something Nora couldn't hear. The executives seemed earnest, frustrated, and angry. Their voices rose with every word. From the looks on their faces, Nora guessed that they weren't actually planning on eating breakfast.

Nora stepped back out of the doorway and closed the door. She glanced around the colony grounds and spotted three security guards patrolling the perimeter. A few colonists walked past her as they headed in for their morning meal. They nodded at Nora, but didn't speak.

The air felt cold and brittle. The sky was clear overhead but the temperature hovered near freezing. The wind howled around the tall structures of the colony, whipping dust into Nora's face. She pulled up the collar on her jacket and followed a trail leading down the central concourse toward the command center.

The path led to a small bridge spanning a ravine between two steep cliffs. Nora paused to look over the edge when she reached the bridge and saw it was the same ravine where the Company assassins had tried to ambush the colonists last night.

She stared at the shadows below, wondering if someone would step out from cover and try again today.

A hand touched her arm. Nora spun, yanking away without thinking.

""Easy,"" said a familiar voice. ""We're just trying to help.""

Nora relaxed her grip. The security guard smiled and took his hand back. Looking at him, Nora realized he was young, maybe even younger than herself. His curly hair was brown, and his eyes were blue. He wore dark gray uniform pants with soft boots.

""Sorry. I wasn't expecting anyone else this early,"" Nora told him. She crossed the bridge and walked down the path toward the command center.

""No problem. It's not every day we get a visitor. And a pretty one, too!"" The guard laughed. ""I'm Quentin. What are you doing up so early?""

""Showering."" Nora grinned. ""And getting ready for work. This is my first shift.""

Quentin nodded sagely. ""Yeah, mine, too. So what do you think about our new arrivals? Any idea who they are?""

Nora frowned. ""Do you mean the executives or the Company men?""

""The ones your boss was yelling at.""

""I didn't hear anything."" Nora shook her head. She'd heard Carmichael's raised voice, but she couldn't make out any words. ""It sounded like he was talking to himself. They don't seem very happy.""

""They're not. The Company people want this planet for themselves. Sully and the others aren't having it.""

""What do you mean, 'not having it'?""

303,0.6,0.4,1.0,87.0,7,41.0,"The corridor outside was dimly lit by red emergency lights. The walls were a dull gray but for the occasional metal grate embedded in them. Some of the grates held pipes for water or power lines while others concealed access panels to the colony's engineering bays.

Nora walked briskly through the long corridors toward the mess hall, where she could grab something to eat if her appetite didn't return soon. She passed a few colonists headed for their duties in various directions. Several of the men wore gaudy shirts and jackets over utilitarian suits. Families lingered at tables enjoying morning meals with piles of eggs, pancakes, bacon, toast, orange juice, coffee, and milkshakes—all made from locally sourced ingredients.

Nora had never liked milkshakes, which tasted like cold, sweetened milk and ice cream swirled together in a thick slurry. But they were a staple of her childhood; no one would have survived without the calories.

The colonists ate hearty breakfasts, so Nora felt virtuous when she reached into her pocket and took out a ration bar instead of a breakfast sandwich. She bit into it greedily, savoring the crunchy texture as she chewed. The flavor was far better than the meal she'd been planning to make for herself.

She gulped down the rest of her treat before continuing on toward the mess hall. Her footsteps echoed along the metallic flooring. Nora paused to glance at a few of the colonists she passed, but none gave any indication of noticing her. They were too engrossed in their own business.

Nora followed the path of the corridor outside, then stepped off onto a short landing with a metal grate. She followed the ramp downward to a wide concrete airlock deep underground.

The airlock door opened automatically when she approached, and she stepped inside. A red light glowed above her head. Nora walked briskly through the small room and out into a dimly lit tunnel. The tunnel stretched away for several meters, curving left and right. The walls were unmarked except for a ladder marking an access panel halfway along its length. Nora climbed the ladder and pushed open the hatch.

A large, dry space opened up around her. The ceiling was low and the only illumination came from a single lamp hanging directly overhead, which cast a yellow glow over dusty equipment racks arranged in neat rows. Shelves of assorted tools hung on the wall below it, their contents gleaming dully under the single bulb.

Nora's boots clanged loudly as she walked to the nearest rack and pulled out a pair of work gloves. She glanced at the tool belt she wore strapped across her waistline, then turned to examine the rack again.

The tools were a mix of familiar and unfamiliar. There was a circular saw, a miter box with cutting blades, and a set of wrenches. But there were also hand drills and power cutters. And a small laser cutter. Nora had never seen one before.

She frowned. The colonists were going to have trouble repairing some of this stuff if these tools broke down.

304,0.6,0.4,1.0,70.0,6,45.0,"The hallway outside her room was short and curving, leading to a central atrium where colonists gathered for morning meals. A handful of them lingered around the open dining hall, but most sat alone at tables in the dimly lit room, nursing cups of steaming coffee.

Nora passed through the common area to a small lounge where she could find coffee and a place to sit. She paused at the door, listening to the low murmur of voices within. The chatter was familiar and comforting. People were talking about the previous night's dinner party, their current plans for the day, and what they expected to happen that evening.

Nora smiled. It felt good to be part of this group again. As much as her life depended on maintaining relationships with other people, it was nice occasionally to get together with them without the stress of something important happening.

She sipped her coffee and relaxed in a small chair near the wall, leaning back into the sturdy frame. Her eyes closed briefly and she sighed contentedly.

Only after several minutes did she open her eyes and see a pair of green orbs staring at her. She jerked upright.

""Hello, Nora.""

Nora stared in stunned silence. It was impossible to tell if the voice belonged to a man or woman.

The stranger appeared to be of medium height, but unusually wide. His shoulders were broad and square under his jacket, and he wore a dark uniform with no insignia.

Nora had never seen anyone like him before. He looked... human. But he wasn't.

He stood in the doorframe, gazing at her impassively.

Nora's mouth fell open and she tried to swallow dryness. She knew who he was. Her mind reeled with images of the night before.

The strange visitor nodded as though acknowledging her shock. ""I am Lieutenant General Gordon. I am here to evaluate your progress in repairing the colony's systems, and to offer my assistance. In exchange, you will help me repair an old ship that has been damaged beyond use.""

Nora blinked. ""How do you know about this?""

""General,"" another voice said from behind Nora. She turned in her seat to see a tall, lean man dressed in black. A pair of goggles hid his eyes and cast shadows over his face.

""Yes, Commander Fox,"" the general replied. ""Your assessment is sound, and I concur with it. We have no other options.""

The commander stepped into the lounge room. He was short and stocky, a dark-haired man with sharp features and a hard expression. He wore a similar uniform to the general, but without insignia.

""We'll begin repairs on the ship immediately,"" said the commander in a clipped tone. ""You'll work alongside the general's team. You'll be expected to perform your duties with the same dedication and efficiency as any member of our crew.""

Nora nodded. She couldn't stop staring at General Gordon, who still stood silently in the doorway.

""I've arranged for a dormitory assignment,"" said the commander. ""It will take a few days to get you set up.""

The general spoke his next words through his communications device, which Nora had been trained not to respond to. ""You must also accept that you are now part of this unit.

305,0.6,0.4,1.0,86.0,5,46.0,"The hallways were dim. Some colonists slept now, while others enjoyed a few hours of rest before heading back to their duties. The sound of approaching footsteps brought her up short. She turned at the last minute, but it was too late. A man strode past, hands shoved deep in pockets despite the chill morning air. He wore heavy boots, black trousers, and a blue work shirt that barely came anywhere close to covering his wide shoulders.

Nora shook herself, trying to shake off drowsiness. She couldn't afford to be distracted. And she wasn't going to let anyone get the better of her either. Not today. She was determined to prove it on this miserable planet, so far from everything they knew back home.

Nora followed the man out of her dormitory and into the hallway, keeping pace with him as he walked briskly toward the communal showers. She tried not to look down at the way her fatigues hung on her slender frame.

This colony had been around for only a handful of years. It was small enough that Nora could remember all the faces of each person who lived here. She recognized everyone in sight. But there was no sign of anyone else on duty.

The man passed through the open double doors into the shower room without slowing. The room was empty, its four walls covered in grating metal and pipes that disappeared under the floor. Nora looked up at the ceiling, then followed him to the first set of showers.

There were two sets of six shower heads per wall spaced along an arc across the room. The water flowed from the spigots in a steady stream. Nora stopped when the man didn't turn right away to use one of the nearby showerheads, but instead continued to walk past them. He paused beside the third one, pulling his shirt over the top of the head so he could see where to aim.

Nora swallowed hard and hurried past the man. She held her breath as she stepped into the first row of showers and waited for him to leave.

To her surprise, he said nothing after he finished scrubbing himself down. Nora let out a slow exhale when he turned off the faucet and stepped back into the hall. She watched him disappear around the corner.

She was alone now. But with the door closed, the sound of the shower room filled the cavernous space like thunder. It reverberated through her bones, making her skin tingle.

Nora shook her head and forced herself to move on. She picked up the pace until she caught the man again. He'd reached the end of the corridor and was waiting for her. This time, Nora didn't hesitate. She walked straight to the fourth showerhead, which wasn't used. Nora swung it wide open, letting the water rush over her head and shoulders.

The man stood there watching her.

Nora spun to face him.

306,0.6,0.4,1.0,72.0,5,41.0,"Nora wasn't alone in the dormitory hallways this early in the morning. The colonists were all up and about, though most didn't look eager to face another day of work. She could see them shuffling through their rooms, grabbing clothes, and heading to the communal showers.

Nora's boots made a swishing clatter as she crossed the hallway, causing heads to turn. She recognized some of the faces from previous shifts, but most of the colonists looked like strangers. They had no reason to know her, yet they stared at her with wide eyes.

She didn't bother to hide her annoyance. ""What?""

The colonists'eyes widened further as one of them pointed.

Nora spun around, searching for the threat. A swarm of metallic drones hovered over her head. They glittered in the dimness, chittering. They looked like giant cockroaches with metallic carapaces. They scuttled along the walls of the hall, their legs clicking and scraping. Nora heard a high pitched whine in her ears.

Nora backed away slowly. Her hands shook, and she clutched her utility belt as if it were a lifeline. The drones buzzed around her, circling and darting.

""They're the same ones I've seen before,"" Nora told herself in disbelief. ""How can they be here again already? They only look different because it's dark.""

One of the drones swooped down toward her face. It stopped inches from her lips, hovering there. Its tiny mandibles clicked and hissed.

Nora screamed.

The drone scrambled back up into the air. Others followed it, emerging from the shadows of the hall. They swarmed together above her head. Nora's vision doubled with dizziness, and pain stabbed through her eyes. She staggered back, grasping her temples as if to hold her skull in place. She thought she might faint.

Nora clamped her teeth shut on a cry. She forced herself not to fall over or puke, breathing in short gasps until the buzzing and clicking faded. Then she ran for the nearest exit.

Her boots thudded against the floor as she charged past the colonists milling around in the hall. The door opened onto an exposed courtyard, and Nora threw herself out into the frigid morning air. Her muscles shook with fatigue and cold, but she didn't stop running.

Nora stumbled across the courtyard toward the colony's main gate. It was closed.

""Open!"" Nora shouted in desperation, pounding against the solid metal barrier.

Metal creaked and groaned, but the gate didn't budge. Something heavy pressed down on the other side. Nora pounded harder, shoving back with her palms, hoping the barrier would give way. But it wouldn't shift no matter how much force she put behind it.

The drones followed her into the yard. They buzzed around, chittering, circling overhead.

307,0.6,0.5,1.0,87.0,6,46.0,"She knew better than to trust automatic doors when they malfunctioned. The colony's automated systems were designed by a company whose engineers had been so focused on efficiency that they'd forgotten how to be human. But she couldn't afford to miss her morning meeting with Sully, the administrator responsible for her work schedule.

Nora descended through hallways and corridors, making her way to the main concourse that spanned the center of the colony like a great wheel. A small crowd of colonists gathered there, chatting and munching on stale bread while waiting for the food to come out.

Nora joined them. They looked up at her with bright, inquisitive eyes as she approached. Some of them recognized her, but most didn't. She passed around her breakfast, dispensing it and answering questions. By the time she returned to her room, she was exhausted from the effort.

Exhausted and hungry. Nora flopped back onto her bed and covered her face with her hands. She rolled over and stared at the ceiling. Her brain felt fuzzy and sluggish with hunger.

She'd have to get something to eat soon, if only to stop her stomach growling. But what? There wasn't a vending machine within reach.

Her stomach rumbled again. She sighed and sat up, stifling the urge to roll her eyes. That damn alarm had been going off for the last two hours. It seemed like it had never stopped.

Nora got out of bed and walked to the door, but paused before opening it. The sound of her own footsteps echoed down the hallways. She could hear the colonists talking about the latest reports of malfunctions. They'd probably be talking for a while longer, but she couldn't help herself.

With reluctance, Nora pushed open the door to her quarters and stepped outside. She wrapped her jacket around herself more tightly to keep warm, then followed the sounds of voices down the corridor toward the main concourse.

The dining area was packed with people waiting in line. Nora focused on her feet, walking carefully and trying to avoid making eye contact with anyone who approached her. She didn't want to risk an invitation to chat.

When she reached the front of the line, she took a seat at one of the metal tables and waited. She tried to ignore the lingering aroma of stale food that clung to everyone's clothes, but her stomach grumbled again.

A colonist walked past her table. He had dark hair and a lean face that looked like he hadn't slept much lately. As he passed, Nora caught his scent. Her mouth watered. She'd been so hungry that morning and not realized it until now.

She glanced back at the people in line. Everyone was staring at her. They knew she'd gotten breakfast before them, but they weren't sure why. Nora turned back to the man with the dark hair and tried to catch his gaze. She wanted to look him in the eyes, so she could tell if there was something wrong with him.

He paused a moment and then continued on.

308,0.6,0.5,1.0,76.0,6,44.0,"On the broad walkways outside the dormitories, colonists filed past, heading to work. They were mostly young men and women in their early twenties. The colonists wore utilitarian clothing and boots, but few had time for a full change of clothes after just rising from bed.

Nora paused at the entrance to the communal hall. She looked around, then walked inside. She had been walking for so long already that she knew the way, so the short trip wasn't particularly taxing, but she took her time anyway.

As Nora approached the front counter, she caught sight of the large machine mounted on the wall behind the desk. It was the colony's main computer system, which controlled everything the colonists did. Nora had seen it several times before, though never up close. Now she stopped in front of it and leaned over the edge to peer into its depths.

The computer screen displayed a map of the colony and the solar system beyond with a list of available resources, including water, food, fuel, and equipment. A window showed Nora's current location and her progress toward the end of her shift. And a timer indicated how much time remained until she was due to clock off.

Nora checked the status of each station, making sure they were functioning properly. The power grid looked okay; the water recycling plant seemed fine. But the hydroponics display showed that the crops growing outside were wilting and dying.

A quick glance down at the soil told her why. Her attention sharpened when she saw something moving in the dirt beside one of the plants. It was a small black insect, but it didn't look like any insect Nora had ever seen before. Its body shimmered iridescently in the dim light, so smooth and shiny that it almost glowed. Nora stared harder, fascinated despite herself.

""What is it?""

She jumped. The voice belonged to Eve, who stood behind her, watching with concern. ""It's a beetle,"" Nora said. She reached out a hand and gingerly picked up the beast. It crawled along her fingers, and Nora marveled at its slick smoothness. In the dim light, she couldn't see details except for the shining black spots on its back.

Eve nodded. ""I've never seen anything quite like it before.""

Nora set the beetle down again and did a double take. The creature's glossy chitin was actually an exoskeleton, and it had two pairs of legs instead of four. It looked like some strange hybrid between a bug and a centipede, with a barbed tail that ended in three sharp points.

""This is amazing!"" Nora exclaimed. She lifted the beetle higher, peering closer. Its legs were segmented and jointed, but they didn't have joints or hinges. They just flexed like muscle fibers. And the barbs at the end of its tail weren't actually barbs, but a cluster of spines that rotated and moved independently of each other.

The creature was almost too beautiful to be real. Nora wondered if it could fly.

309,0.6,0.5,1.0,78.0,6,44.0,"The halls were quiet this early in the morning. The colony's corridors were wide, with high ceilings for optimal airflow. All of the walls, floors, and ceiling panels were plated metal. Nora walked along one of the main concourses at a brisk pace, passing several people who glanced up from their work to watch her pass.

The colonists worked hard every day, but they still had time to socialize. Nora walked past the other end of the corridor and found a dining hall. The door slid open for her automatically.

A few minutes later she sat down to a breakfast buffet. She did not stop when the food was placed on the table in front of her; instead, she continued to scan the room.

Nora knew what she would see if anyone else was present. But there were no others. She could only focus on her meal. Her eyes scanned the room, searching for clues about who might have been here last night.

She saw a young woman wearing a dark blue uniform sitting alone at the far end of the long counter. A slight pang of guilt struck Nora. She'd eaten with this person yesterday, and now she wasn't here for breakfast.

Her unease eased slightly. At least Nora hadn't spent the entire evening in a corner sulking over her lack of sleep.

She picked up her fork and poked at her eggs. The sound echoed through the large space. Nora's ears perked up. What was that?

Nora lifted her head. The dining hall was silent, but the air felt charged. She couldn't hear anything unusual.

Noises from the kitchen caught her attention. A few people were bustling back and forth in a mix of conversations and clanging trays. Nora turned toward the noise, but it was gone before she could pinpoint its source.

Nora paused to consider her options. She briefly considered going to investigate, but she didn't want to get too close to any potential danger. Instead, she decided to find the source of the strange noises.

The sense of unease faded when Nora exited the dimly lit dining area and stepped into a brightly lit hallway. The hallways were wide with high ceilings, and they were lined with light panels on each side. Nora walked briskly along the rows of identical doors until she spotted a sign reading ""Engineering.""

She passed several rooms and found the one marked in green. Nora flipped open the door, pushed past the threshold, and entered a small room. On the walls hung dozens of metallic plates and conduits. She heard faint humming sounds echoing through the space.

Nora's eyes followed the equipment back to its source, which was a squat metal box sitting atop two sturdy legs. A large fan whirred quietly at the top of the device. It was the size of an old refrigerator, but unlike a refrigerator Nora knew it wasn't refrigerated. She'd seen similar devices before, even in her own home. They were called fusion reactors. They produced power for the colony.

Nora approached the machine and examined the controls. The buttons were labeled with unfamiliar symbols. She started to press them, but paused. This wasn't like any reactor she had ever worked on. There was no safety interlock;

310,0.6,0.5,1.0,76.0,6,44.0,"The walkways were slick from dew, but Nora moved quickly to avoid the patches. She made her way around a few corners to the communal hall where she could find a cafe serving breakfast.

She waited in line at the counter, fidgeting even though she knew it wasn't worth worrying about when her food came out right behind hers. Still, the hesitation remained. The other colonists in the queue smiled at each other, their eyes quick to catch her attention. They nodded encouragingly at her as they passed.

Nora returned the nods with a shy smile. Their concern and solidarity calmed her nerves as she took her seat.

Immediately, Nora noticed how much her surroundings had changed since last night. The lighting was brighter. She huddled herself in her seat, pulling the collar of her shirt over her head. The weather had warmed significantly overnight. Perhaps a storm had blown through, and the colony had been spared yet another cold snap.

At least the sky outside looked clear. And there was no fog or dust to obscure vision.

The alarm chimed again, and Nora sighed. She checked her watch. Her shift was underway. But the engineers could deal with the problems until after work, so she turned back to her meal.

Her plate arrived before the time for her next break, but she didn't mind. She'd earned it.

Nora ate mechanically, spooning up the contents of the bowl in silence while a server passed her a cup of coffee. She took small sips to keep from burning her tongue. The drink tasted burnt and bitter, but she forced down the rest.

Once the stew had been cleared away, Nora accepted a second cup of coffee with thanks. She sat alone at her table, nursing the last remnants of the beverage as she used her tablet to check the planetary data.

The planet was called Presley's Promise, though no one ever bothered to say that name. It was a barren rock with only the barest traces of atmosphere and life. The colony itself was located on the equator, with the landscape dotted with jagged cliffs and boulders like teeth set into a grim smile. There were no water sources, so the colonists had to rely solely on supplies delivered by the Company from orbit.

Nora sighed and put the tablet aside. She pushed her chair back and stood. No, she corrected herself. They didn't have to rely solely.

311,0.6,0.5,1.0,80.0,6,44.0,"The dormitory hallways were quiet, but she could hear activity in the kitchen. The colony's communal mess hall was located at the end of each hallway. The walls were lined with doors leading to single rooms, although many of them were vacant. She passed by one door as she proceeded toward the kitchen. Most of the colonists slept on mats laid out on the concrete floors, but a few chose to sleep in their own beds instead.

The sounds of clanking pots, smacking frying pans, and piping hot coffee filled the air. Nora paused at the entrance to the kitchens, savoring the rich aromas wafting from the open-fronted grill. She took a deep breath of the aromatic steam, then walked inside.

A short, stocky woman stood over the grill. She was wearing a sleeveless shirt that displayed her muscular arms, covered in tattoos and old scars. A blue bandanna tied back her long hair, revealing the white streaks in it. She turned at the sound of Nora's footsteps.

""Hey, Nora,"" she said with a smile. ""You're up early.""

Nora nodded and smiled back warily. This was the first time she'd seen Cuesta since she started working at the colony, but she already knew what to expect from her. The woman had a reputation for being a bit too friendly, even by the standards of the colony.

Cuesta put the spatula down and came around the grill to meet Nora halfway. She extended her hand in greeting, which Nora hesitated to shake. After several seconds of awkward silence, Nora accepted the handshake. Her eyes widened as she looked into Cuesta's face.

Cuesta laughed, an odd sound that echoed through the kitchen. ""I'm just messing with you,"" she said with a laugh. ""But I did want to say hi. You've been doing pretty well lately."" She glanced at Nora's clothes and pointed at her utility pants. ""It looks like they got their money's worth from your final project.""

""Thanks."" Nora tugged at the jacket sleeves, trying to get them to cover her hands. ""So what do you think of my latest?"" She held out a piece of metalwork shaped vaguely like a spear.

Cuesta took it, keeping her own expression neutral. ""What is this? It's beautiful.""

Nora nodded proudly. ""The Company gave me a prize for the work I did on improving the colony's shielding grid. They promised to give me some credits if I could come up with a design to improve the colony's defenses.""

Cuesta seemed impressed. ""That must be expensive.""

""I don't know the credit unit,"" Nora said, suddenly embarrassed at having mentioned her award. ""But it's enough to buy a whole new shield generator... and for that matter, enough to pay off the debt I owe the company.""

""Well, you earned it,"" Cuesta said. The woman shrugged as she moved back over to the grill. She reached down and picked up a frying pan, then turned around to face Nora again. ""You're not going to get anything else done today, right?""

Nora shook her head.

312,0.6,0.5,1.0,62.0,7,41.0,"The colony's infrastructure held together by thick cables and sturdy plates made of steel-like material linked to structural supports that connected the buildings. The lights shone bright, but only illuminated a small portion of the expansive complex. Most areas remained in shadow, but even the shadows were somehow deep and ominous.

The colonists'utilities ran off solar panels, but they couldn't use all the energy generated. In the event of power failures, the colonists relied on emergency generators that powered life support systems.

Nora walked through the garage district. On one side of the concourse were enormous repair bays for the colony's vehicles and equipment. On the other, smaller spaces housed maintenance tools, spare parts, and supplies.

Nora opened a door to a large warehouse space filled with rows of shelves stocked full of tools and supplies. She grabbed a tool belt from a rack near the back wall, buckled it around her waist, and pulled a tool kit from a nearby shelf.

One of the colony's cars was parked in front of Nora's work bay as she emerged from the storage room. A few mechanics worked on the car, and Nora paused to greet them before heading toward the command center.

Four mechanics were working under the supervision of a Company engineer named Rick. He had his hands buried in the hood of the vehicle with the others while he spoke into a hand-held microphone. It looked like the same model Nora used for downtime repairs.

""Hey, Rick,"" one mechanic called out.

Rick turned and smiled at her. ""Hi, Nora.""

""How are things going?""

""I'll have that thing up and running in another hour or so. You want to take a break? I can pull you off for five minutes.""

Nora swallowed a sigh. ""No, I'm fine. See you later.""

She walked through the garage and took stock of her surroundings. The floor was covered with tough metal grating that made a soft clinking sound. The walls were dark gray but showed bright spots where the neon lights cast shadows in stark relief.

The air was cool, dry, and stale, which Nora attributed to the constant ventilation system. She could hear the hum of electrical power generators coming from somewhere else in the complex.

Nora entered a large open space filled with computer terminals and workstations. Along one wall, large windowless doors marked the entrance to the colony's command center. A Company engineer sat at the nearest terminal typing commands on a keyboard.

313,0.6,0.5,1.0,74.0,8,46.0,"The dormitories were deserted, but that meant little. As a colony mechanic, she knew the only time anyone slept in the dorms was when they needed to be there. In fact, it wasn't unusual for many of the colonists to work late at night. No one wanted to miss their alarms, so the lights stayed off until early morning.

Nora made her way towards the mess hall. A few others would be heading out to grab a quick bite, though the majority seemed to have already done so. The tables were empty save for the scraps of food left behind on the trays. Nora frowned as her eyes fell upon the remains of her breakfast.

The mishmash of half-eaten foods was still sitting atop her plate. She picked it up and placed it next to the other scraps scattered around the table. Maybe she could salvage that after breakfast, or if she didn't find anything good in the kitchens.

With a sigh, Nora walked on.

Nora passed through the main concourse, which contained nothing more than a small room with vending machines, a payphone, and a single exit door leading outside. She made her way past the command center and up to the cafeteria where she found the kitchen staff hard at work.

The kitchen was a large, industrial space capable of feeding thousands. The floor was covered in thick, smooth tiles big enough to serve as swimming pools for any number of giant aliens. It also housed a massive conveyor belt that spanned the entire width of the facility, hauling huge blocks of ice from the hydroponic greenhouses to the storage bins and water tanks.

A series of metal shelves lined the walls, filled with supplies. Most were empty and waiting for cargo to arrive. Nora spotted a few cooked meals stacked next to the cold food lockers, but the selection wasn't very appealing. She made her way towards the walk-in refrigerator and pulled open the heavy door. Nora froze as she saw the colorful array of ingredients inside.

There was fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, and other items from exotic planets. Despite the lack of refrigeration, everything was perfectly preserved. A few containers had already been opened and consumed, while others were still sealed shut.

Nora stepped in and grabbed a handful of carrots off the shelf. She sniffed them before stuffing the bright orange and purple vegetable into her mouth. As soon as she bit down on it, the crunchy texture exploded across her taste buds. The sweetness of the carrot combined with its savory bite, making for an explosion of flavor.

314,0.6,0.5,1.0,80.0,4,45.0,"The corridor outside her dormitory opened up onto a large central area filled by tables covered in food and drink, a few couches, a small pool table, and chairs. The room smelled of frying bacon and fresh coffee.

Nora wandered over to the nearest table, finding a mug of steaming black coffee there already. She sipped it gratefully as she took a seat, then put her hands on the table and leaned towards the crowd of people gathered around it.

""I'm Nora,"" she said. ""Who's got my shift?""

One of the men at the counter turned to point at a tall man with sandy hair. He wore a dark blue uniform that looked like it had been tailored for him, and he carried a big tray loaded high with food.

""You're on duty today,"" the man told her, handing over Nora's shift. ""This is your meal.""

Nora accepted the plate and fork before sitting back down. She dug in while keeping the excited conversation going.

""How long have you been here?"" one woman asked her, smiling. Her eyes were bright and eager.

""Just a couple days,"" Nora replied around a mouthful of food. ""Got stuck on patrol duty last night, but I'm off this morning. Lucky me.""

A man with salt-and-pepper hair laughed and tapped his own plate. ""I was lucky enough to get the first shift of the day, believe it or not. We're getting some sleep tonight!""

Nora grinned. ""That's what I hear. You guys are working hard.""

""Harder than we ever imagined,"" the woman said. The look she gave Nora made her shiver. ""We thought it would be a quiet weekend, but just when we started to relax there's been an emergency repair call from the outer rim.""

""What kind of emergency?"" Nora asked.

The man with the sandy hair chuckled. ""You're going out there? You'll see for yourself soon enough. If that's the way you want to spend your afternoon, then I say go ahead.""

Nora took a deep breath. ""I'll take it. Thanks.""

She nodded at the woman who'd spoken up, and they shared a smile. The woman spoke again. ""My name is Jessa. This is my partner in crime, Kelly.""

Nora set her fork down with a clink of utensils on the table. ""Hey,"" she said to Kelly, nodding. ""Nice meeting you.""

Kelly's face flushed pink. She smiled back shyly.

Jessa patted Nora's shoulder. ""You're new, so I'll let it slide. But don't forget your helmet.""

Nora's dark brown eyes widened. ""Helmet?"" she repeated in a squeak.

""It's standard procedure,"" Jessa said.

""But... what if...""

""Don't worry. It's not like we're going to have to fight our way through an army of drones.""

Nora looked around the room. Most people were eating breakfast, but a few were still talking. One man had his arms folded across his chest and was staring at her with a determined frown.

""I'm sorry. I didn't know...""

""No worries,"" Jessa told her. ""Some of us are just paranoid. We've been here too long, and we're starting to lose it.""

315,0.6,0.5,1.0,87.0,6,45.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty. The lights had not yet come on. The corridors were narrow and dimly lit, but she could see well enough to check the time on her wristwatch. She made her way along the halls, passing doors leading off to other colonists'quarters. Doors remained closed and latched; no one else was awake, so it must be early.

The colony's power plant hummed in the distance, its high-pitched whine filling the air. It was a comforting sound. Nora breathed deep as she walked past the engineering bays. She had worked tending to machinery and equipment for years, so the plant felt like home.

She passed the pantry where food was stored and distributed, then stopped at the dormitories. A few colonists were already up, but most of them slept late. Nora checked the small room assigned to her by the Company, then stepped into the communal bathroom and showered until her skin tingled. She returned to her room and washed her hair before dressing in the clothes from her locker.

Nora fixed a quick breakfast of coffee, oatmeal, and dried fruit while pondering what to do next. The engineering bay was open. She should probably go there first to check on her tools and equipment. It would be faster than getting dressed, at least.

It was too much trouble to get out of bed again, though. Better to just sleep longer if she could.

She took her time entering the dimly lit building. Despite the colorless walls and lighting, she found herself in a familiar place. Nora had been coming here often lately, since the colony's power plant was still undergoing repairs.

After the recent surge, it seemed like half the machines in the engineering area were broken, and Nora had spent hours trying to fix them or replace them with new ones. The work was tedious, but she enjoyed tinkering with the equipment on the large factory floor. Being able to make things work again gave her some sense of control over her life.

Nora paused in front of a group of crates stacked in a corner off the main aisle. She felt her pulse quicken as she realized they were full of replacement parts for her equipment. Her smile grew wider at the thought. The Company must have sent more replacements after the malfunctioning generators.

She approached one large crate and examined its contents. A part labeled'power loaders'was among the supplies. Nora opened the lid and took out the device. It was a heavy-duty model with oversized wheels and a long, thin extension handle. She flipped the switch on the side of the unit to turn it on. Nora flexed her tired arms in anticipation.

The machine whirred into motion, and she grinned. Nora quickly attached several cables to the back of the power loader and plugged them into the wall. She turned the controller on the top up to maximum power. The loader rolled smoothly across the room, following the path laid out by the cable.

The power loader came to rest just outside the door, so Nora retrieved it and carried it back inside.

316,0.6,0.5,1.0,73.0,8,48.0,"The dormitory doors were closed behind her, but she could hear the sounds of others rising from their beds—a few mutters, the clatter of boots, the squeak of bedsprings. The air smelled faintly of fresh laundry, body odors, and sweat.

She passed a row of bunks near the door and saw one empty bed, then another. Nora stopped at the next empty bunk, where she usually slept. Her roommate was not present to greet her in person and the thin mattress was cold under her back.

After a moment of hesitation, Nora climbed into the bed and turned over onto her side. She tried to ignore the chill as she rolled up the blankets, pulling them snugly around her shoulders and hips.

The room felt different without a woman here. Nora missed the female presence that had always been there, especially when they were together. But her roommate wasn't like any other woman Nora knew. She was an artificial intelligence and Nora did not know how to interact with her.

Nora's mother had left the colony for Earth just before Nora was born, leaving her only her father. He died shortly after Nora took control of the colony's computers, safeguarding it from the Company's takeover until Nora grew older.

When she graduated high school and was ready to join the workforce, Nora went looking for work outside the colony. With no family ties, she expected that she'd have to start over in a new place. That was why she was surprised to find the Company recruiting her.

Because Nora was young, smart, and handy with mechanical systems, the Company thought she might be a good fit for their needs.

Nora followed the sound of voices, the faint melody of a piano, and the echoes of metallic footsteps until she reached the dining hall.

Like most places on the planet, the dining hall was vast and cavernous. At one end was a long table where people ate their meals on metal benches. The large room was filled with tables and chairs for eating, drinking, or talking.

A few colonists sat around the edges of the room, but most had already finished eating. Nora walked through the kitchen area, which was set up along the opposite wall. She glanced back to watch a man in chef's whites carrying two steaming plates of food into the dining hall. The smell of sausage, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes wafted her way.

Nora entered the dining hall, where tables were lined up in orderly rows. The metal benches were filled with eager colonists who looked up as Nora passed. She eyed them coolly, annoyed that they didn't know better than to wander around after dark. She climbed the stairs to the second level and found a seat at the end of a table near the front. A glass case held a selection of fruits, nuts, and vegetables.

The dining hall was dimly lit, but Nora could make out a woman in the corner playing an old upright piano. No instruments hung on the walls, and no music played from hidden speakers. There weren't even any bookshelves or decorations to speak of. The only decorations were several paintings hanging on the wall, one above each headrest.

The first painting showed a group of four colonists standing in a field of wheat. It was poorly framed and scratched with age, but it still evoked the rugged beauty of Earth. The next painting depicted a colonial ship docking in orbit around a planet. This was also well done, though Nora couldn't see what kind of ship it might be. The final picture depicted a colony settlement huddled under a mountain.

On either side of Nora, two other tables filled with people sat waiting for their turn to eat. As Nora stared at the second-to-last image, a man at the far end of her table stood up and walked away without saying anything. He wore a dark suit and tie, his hair slicked back, and he looked like someone who expected important business later that day.

Nora glanced around the room again as she waited for another colonist to sit down, noticing a few colonists who had been eating earlier were now gone. She blinked in confusion. Had they left already?

She leaned forward and saw the empty seats where they'd been sitting. The food was gone, and nobody else was getting breakfast. Nora frowned. What was going on here?

At last a colonist joined her, pulling out the chair across from Nora's with a bang. The woman was tall, thin, and pale, wearing blue trousers and a buttoned shirt. Her hair was long and straight, and she wore no makeup.

""Good morning,"" Nora said as politely as possible.

The colony's power plant was a large cylinder in the center of the complex. Its fusion reactor was concealed behind a wall covered in transparent plates, but its glow was visible through the cracks. Nora walked past the power plant, heading for the cafeteria.

She passed a couple of colonists who were just waking up. One yawned and stretched as he looked around at the hallways. Another was roused from sleep by the alarm. He sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes.

Nora ignored them both as she headed toward the cafeteria. The corridor was lined with doors that led to the dormitories. Some of the rooms had small windows and a view of the surrounding landscape, while others were dark and silent.

The door to the cafeteria stood open. Nora stepped inside, blinking in the sudden brightness of electric lights. She blinked again when she saw everyone else already seated at the tables.

""Hey,"" said a young man. ""You're late.""

Nora shrugged, glancing around the room. Most of the colonists were already eating. A few glanced over at her, but most continued with their meals.

""I didn't want to wake you,"" Nora replied. ""I'll be right back.""

She turned and walked out of the cafeteria.

The corridors were even dimmer than the halls, but they were lit by electric lights set into the walls. Nora paused outside the door to one of the dormitories, listening for sounds from within. She heard nothing except faint snores.

Nora opened the door and stepped inside. The room was empty save for a single cot with a thin blanket folded on top of it.

Nora closed the door and locked it, then made her way to the next dormitory. This one was empty too. She unlocked the door and stepped inside.

The room was dark. Nora flipped the light switch, but the fluorescent bulbs were dead. The only illumination came from the electric lights in the hallways.

She looked down at herself. Her clothes were dirty, sweat-stained, and torn. Her boots had scuffs on them from walking through dust and dirt.

Nora sighed. She couldn't blame the colonists for being asleep when the alarm went off. It wasn't their fault, but it meant she'd have to go back and get more sleep before starting work.

She left the room and walked back toward the cafeteria. As she passed the power plant, she could see a faint glow coming from inside. Nora wondered if the reactor was still running.

The cafeteria was dimly lit by electric lights set into the walls. The tables were covered in plastic plates and utensils. A few colonists sat at the tables, eating breakfast and talking quietly.

Nora spotted an empty table near the wall. She pulled out a chair and sat down.

She took note of the fact that everyone was well dressed in their work clothes, but it wasn't unusual to see workers in the colony clad only in shorts when they weren't working.

She followed the main corridor around a corner and saw the cafeteria. A handful of people occupied seats at the tables scattered throughout the room. Most were young, though there was one middle-aged man still awake and eating as Nora entered.

Nora headed for the food dispenser mounted on the wall near the entrance, pulling out a couple of ration bars from her pocket as she went. She grabbed a cup of coffee from another machine next to it. As she fished through her pockets, Nora's eyes caught sight of the bulletin board hanging beside the dispensers. There were several notices about malfunctions posted on the board.

The first four messages were from the last shift before hers, and Nora imagined that the others would be similar. She read them with a growing sense of unease. The problems plaguing the colony had grown worse.

A glance down the corridor showed that it was clear of humans for now; everyone else seemed to have gone ahead to breakfast. Nora picked up her pace and hurried toward the cafeteria to get some food.

If work was continuing on schedule, then the other colonists were already in the mess hall. But if something serious had happened, Nora would find out soon enough.

* * *

The food dispenser selected a couple of rations for Nora and handed them over with a flourish. She took both items, stuffing one into her pocket, and walked back toward the cafeteria. The board behind the machine was still empty.

She paused before the door leading to the corridor. She peered at the bulletin board again, looking for any signs of trouble. Nothing new. With a sigh, she entered the crowded room.

Nora didn't have long to wait. As she expected, the cafeteria was filled with people eating breakfast. She joined the line in front of the dispensers and waited while her selections were printed. The next few messages were from other shifts, which made Nora feel better about the situation.

As Nora approached a food station, one of its conveyor belts chugged forward and deposited an item on the table in front of her. A blue box containing two carefully arranged meals appeared. Nora pulled out her bar and dug in.

After downing two ration bars, Nora sat back to survey the mess hall. Everyone was still eating. No sign of trouble, so far. Nora checked the bulletin board for any more messages and found nothing. She stood up and headed back toward her quarters.

The message printout was still blank when Nora passed the bulletin board again. That's odd, she thought. I wonder what happened to everyone.

As she made her way along the hallways, Nora passed other colonists wandering aimlessly about. Some of them looked like they hadn't slept in days.

She blinked at a few of the colonists who stopped to stare back at her. Then she realized what she was doing and tried not to look too startled as she hurried past. She couldn't avoid the occasional curious glance, but she didn't stop to chat either.

The cafeteria was quiet, mostly because it was still early on a work day. Nora walked through the deserted room toward the small kitchen area where she could grab something quick before heading out again.

""Hi,"" said a voice from behind her. Nora froze, one hand poised over the handle of the food dispenser. She spun around in reflexive anger only to find herself facing a tall woman with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes.

Nora must have been staring, because the woman smiled gently. ""I'm sorry if I startled you.""

Nora exhaled. Her heart rate slowed almost immediately. Maybe it was just exhaustion after working late last night or maybe the woman reminded her of someone she knew.

""You're..."" Nora hesitated, trying to think of how to approach the situation. She didn't want to be rude, but she also needed information. ""What are you doing here?""

The woman's smile broadened. ""My name is Rennie. My family works for the Company. I'm a mechanic. Is there anything else you need to know? If not, I'll let you get back to work.""

Nora nodded and turned away. The woman followed her, speaking over her shoulder. ""Is everything all right? You seemed surprised. What's your name?""

""Nora,"" she said without looking around.

Rennie chuckled warmly. ""That's a nice name. It suits you. Are you from Earth?""

Nora shook her head. ""We come from the planet Mercury.""

""Oh! That's so interesting!"" Rennie exclaimed. She reached out and touched Nora's arm in a friendly way. ""Were you born there, then?""

Nora shrugged uncomfortably. ""I don't really remember. I grew up on Mars until my family came out here to settle down. But my mom died when I was young, so I never met her.""

""Oh,"" Rennie said. She took her hand back and cast a shy smile at the floor. ""Sorry about that. I didn't mean to pry.""

Nora sighed inwardly. A few years ago, she would have been offended, but now she just shrugged. ""It's okay. So what do you want, then?""

Rennie blinked, puzzled. ""What do I want? Oh! I'm sorry. I forgot we're not supposed to ask personal questions.""

""Sure,"" Nora said. ""Whatever. You know how it is. Here I am being all polite and you go and say something like that.""

""Well, I just thought you must be lonely out here. No one else seems to talk much.""

Nora gave her a flat stare. ""You'd think they'd get used to us after six months.

321,0.6,0.6,1.0,86.0,5,48.0,"The dormitory halls were dark, but a handful of colonists were already up and about. From their day shifts, they headed to the dining hall for food. Most people would have gone straight to work after eating, but Nora had worked late last night, so she decided to grab something quick.

She made her way through the dim corridors, enjoying the feel of the cold plastic soles of her boots on the smooth floor as she moved. The sound of her footsteps echoed off the walls, creating a strange, hollow thump that kept time with the alarm pulsing in her ear.

Nora passed a dozen colonists on her way to the cafeteria, each of them heading in the same direction. Some of them scowled at the device chirping overhead, others ignored it. In contrast to her own grumpy mood, Nora found herself smiling.

When she arrived at the cafeteria, the aroma of fresh coffee and eggs wafted from the kitchen. She took a seat near the back and waited for her tray.

The meal was a delicious, if not exactly filling, repast. Nora wasn't sure what the colonists ate during their break times other than more coffee and likely warm bread with jam. But it tasted good, especially now that she'd gotten over feeling like she might die of hunger while waiting for her breakfast.

After finishing, she washed the dishes and carried them to the cleaning station. The work would keep her busy until lunch, but it was preferable to doing nothing.

Except standing around.

Nora's tray clattered into place with a satisfying thud as she set the plates down in front of the next person who wanted to use the dishwasher. A woman wearing a sari stood before her, examining one hand and then the other. When Nora offered her left hand for inspection, the woman shook her head.

""You're right-handed,"" Nora said. ""I guess I'm used to it.""

The woman smiled and took hold of Nora's arm. Her fingers were cool and dry, and Nora could feel the slight tremble that ran through them.

""What are you doing here?"" she asked.

""Working late last night,"" Nora said. ""Trying to get a fix on a broken system, but..."" She shrugged helplessly and tried again. ""My tools won't work anymore.""

""There is no fixing it,"" the woman replied. ""We have to leave.""

Nora stared at her for a moment, unsure what to say. The woman's face was drawn and pale, as though she hadn't been sleeping well lately.

The alarm continued to chirp.

Nora glanced up and saw that the woman was really looking at her, not just staring at the device in Nora's ear.

""Oh!"" Nora said, jerking upright. ""Sorry! What did you say?""

""You are the first person we've seen since we arrived,"" the woman said quietly. ""Now there will be others, but you must go.""

She turned and walked away without waiting for an answer.

322,0.6,0.6,1.0,80.0,5,45.0,"Nora passed through the main hallways, where colonists shuffled about in ragged forms, faces slack from exhaustion as they milled around their morning meals. A few people glanced up at Nora when she passed but then returned to finishing their breakfasts.

She walked past the dormitories, where a handful of colonists slept soundly nearby. Other colonists splashed water onto themselves, trying to wash away the sleepiness. People chatted amicably among themselves until Nora heard footsteps approaching.

Nora turned to see one of the colony's young male technicians walking toward her. He was tall and slender with curly dark hair that fell over his eyes in a mess of tangles. The man wore thick, gray coveralls that blended into the dull metal color of the colony walls. His face was clean shaven and lined with fatigue.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. ""I'm running late for work.""

The technician looked a little surprised but nodded in return. ""Yeah, I know.""

Nora frowned. ""What?""

""You're always late.""

""I have a job to do here.""

""Sure."" The young man shrugged, but his expression remained grim.

He continued walking toward the exit of the dormitory. Nora followed him out. Behind her, the door closed with a quiet thud.

Nora noticed something odd as she walked. She couldn't remember the last time there had been two people in the hallway at the same time. Her mind drifted to thoughts of the colonists'odd behavior.

Nora imagined herself as an animal, a predator stalking prey. It was oddly satisfying to imagine herself this way. She felt powerful and confident. She noticed her body moving with its own momentum, full of purpose. She remembered how it thrilled when she'd caught a whiff of the aliens' scent.

That was more than a month ago. The entire colony had smelled like them then. Now, no trace of their odor lingered. Nora wondered if they were gone or if their scent was being masked somehow.

She watched the young man walk ahead of her and noted there was no one else on the level corridor outside.

""Hey,"" said Nora. ""What's your name?""

The technician stopped in his tracks, turning around. He looked at her curiously for a moment before shaking off whatever thought he'd been about to say. ""Huh? Sorry.""

Nora smiled. She liked people who didn't ask obvious questions. At least she hadn't seen anyone else around yet that seemed to have any interest in her.

""So, what do you think of our little colony so far?"" Nora asked.

The young man shook his head. ""It's pretty cool, I guess. But I'm not sure why we're here. I mean, there are lots of other planets out there. Why did the Company pick this one?""

Nora nodded. ""I know. We don't really know either. But it seems like the Company has an agenda with us. Something bigger than just mining resources.""

""Really?"" The young man sounded intrigued.

""Yeah, but I can't figure out what it is. Maybe someone else will come along and help me understand.""

""Maybe,"" the man said.

323,0.6,0.6,1.0,73.0,5,47.0,"The halls were filled with young colonists. Most were still asleep. Nora lengthened her stride, anxious to leave the dormitories behind. Her eyes lingered fondly on memory of the first time she'd seen those rooms.

She was ten years old then. The colony had been founded and settled only two years ago. But in that brief span of time, Nora's family had already established themselves among the best. They'd become part of the Company's elite.

Nora recalled the excitement that day. She remembered her father, who started the celebration. He'd thrown a party for his new wife, who was pregnant with Nora's mother. She remembered how her mother was dressed that night like a princess—in a gown of white satin so sheer it almost seemed to be made from nothing but air. And Nora remembered her own birthday party, which took place that day.

Nora didn't know what to make of her parents'happiness. She knew they were very good at their jobs. She understood that everyone in the company was required to work hard and play harder. It wasn't a matter of if people worked hard; it was a question of whether or not you could afford to slack off.

But Nora's father was different. He always smiled when he came home. He never looked tired. When he laughed, it sounded natural and happy. And Nora respected him.

As a child, she'd seen her mother flirt with other men. She saw the way the Company executives treated their wives as extensions of themselves. But her father didn't seem bothered by any of that. He just loved being around his family. His love for them was pure and unadulterated. Nora envied that.

Nora's father had married a woman who was beautiful and rich. He'd played the part of doting husband well. He even joked about it when Nora watched him with her mother.

""Don't worry, sweetie,"" he told her. ""You're going to be a doctor someday.""

Nora knew she wasn't like her parents. She didn't have the same confidence or drive that they did. Her childhood was spent feeling left out and judged for not living up to their standards.

Nora had been born two years after the colony went online. Her father was too busy with his research to spend time with her, and she didn't want to see him anyway.

She'd joined the colony because she wanted a real life—a chance to explore new worlds, meet new people, and find herself. The Company offered that. And Nora's parents gave her that opportunity. They were the ones who got her into this. She owed them everything.

Nora had no idea what awaited her in the command center. But she knew her job as an engineer would keep her alive long enough for, if not her own future, then at least a few others'.

324,0.6,0.6,1.0,80.0,6,45.0,"The dormitories were quiet at this early hour, but Nora didn't see any other colonists stirring outside their rooms. She walked briskly through the halls, passing the communal showers without stopping. A few minutes later she reached the cafeteria, where a handful of colonists sat around tables, eating silently.

As Nora approached the serving counter, a young woman in her late teens looked up from her bowl of cereal. Her dark brown eyes narrowed as they met Nora's gaze, and the girl stood abruptly.

""Good morning,"" Nora said cheerfully. ""I'm here for my breakfast.""

The girl glared at her. ""You're late."" She turned on her heel and left the cafeteria, leaving Nora alone with her food.

Nora sighed, picked up a spoon, and started to eat. The food was cold, but it tasted good. She finished quickly and set the utensil down on the tray.

She glanced over at the empty table where the girl had been sitting, then made her way back to her quarters.

* * *

The next day, Nora woke early again. She dressed in her work clothes—a utility jacket, a pair of pants, and boots. She checked herself for the hundredth time in the mirror, making sure the buttons on her shirt were buttoned properly. Then she headed out into the hallways of the colony.

Nora strode briskly through the corridors, heading toward the command center. As she walked, she kept a sharp eye out for any signs of trouble.

The colonists'quarters were quiet and orderly, but Nora was still alert for anything amiss. She passed several people in their rooms, some asleep and others awake. One man sat on his bunk reading a book. Another woman was washing dishes. A few more stood at the sinks, scrubbing their hands and faces clean before going to work.

Nora paused outside the command center's door and listened carefully. The alarm sounded again, but this time it wasn't an emergency. It was the automated security system testing itself.

The door slid open as Nora approached. She stepped inside, and the door closed behind her. Eve greeted her with a polite ""Good morning,"" from somewhere in the back of the room.

""Morning,"" Nora said, stepping over to one of the terminals. The monitor showed a long list of maintenance requests.

Nora frowned. ""Why is there so much work?""

Eve replied, ""You have been here for less than two weeks.""

Nora looked at the screen again. There were a dozen items on it. All of them were critical repairs or replacements. Some of the equipment had failed completely, leaving the colony without power and communications. Others had malfunctioned and needed repair.

""This isn't right,"" Nora muttered. She turned to the terminal's main menu and clicked on a new item. A list appeared, detailing what was wrong and how it could be fixed.

Nora scrolled through the list until she found the problem. The colonists'communications array had gone down. It was probably just a loose connection, but it would take a while to fix.

She sighed. ""I'll go check it out.""

325,0.6,0.6,1.0,95.0,3,41.0,"The dormitory hallways were empty except for a few colonists in line at the communal showers. Nora walked past them, noting that their faces looked paler than usual, their clothes dingy.

In the dining hall, she found a table full of people eating breakfast. Sully sat there, reading from a tablet. He nodded absently to Nora as she walked up.

""Morning,"" he said. ""I brought you coffee.""

Nora took the mug gratefully, grateful for the hot beverage to ward off the chill morning air.

Sully glanced over her shoulder. ""You're almost late. Don't keep your boss waiting.""

A smile tugged at Nora's lips. She turned back to him, pleased with the effect of her new uniform. ""Thanks.""

""No problem."" Sully gestured toward a chair across from him. ""Sit down, please. I'm sure you don't want to be late for your first day on the job.""

Nora sat with a sigh and sipped at her coffee. The mug was cold, but it still helped warm her hands enough to heat the rest of her body.

She studied Sully with an eye for detail. He looked tired, his eyes bloodshot, his hair disheveled. Nora wondered if she should offer to help fix breakfast, since she knew the cook. But that would only make Sully more anxious about being late.

""Are you okay?"" Nora asked. ""You look like hell.""

Sully gave a half-hearted shrug. ""Not the best sleep last night, I guess. That's why I got here early.""

Nora nodded. She understood how the exhaustion could feel like a weight on a person's shoulders. It didn't matter what she'd been doing; she felt it too.

""Did you get some rest? You know, before you came here?"" Nora leaned forward. ""I mean... you're not the only one who can be tired.""

""What do you mean?"" Sully asked.

Nora bit her lip. Should she tell him about the colony's secrets? She thought of Simon, the engineer who had died after falling through a ventilation shaft on their way to inspect the colony. Nora shuddered. Sometimes death seemed so much worse than living.

""It's nothing,"" Nora said. ""Just—you've been working hard lately, haven't you?""

Sully looked away uncomfortably.

Nora pressed on more firmly. ""I mean, there must be something wrong. Why are you always so tired?""

Sully cleared his throat. ""Well, uh... I've been having trouble sleeping.""

""That's terrible. Don't you have anything to help with that?""

He glanced up at her. ""Yeah, but..."" He paused. ""I don't want to talk about it.""

Nora frowned in confusion. She could see he was hiding something. But she didn't understand why.

""Sully—what is it? I'm your friend.""

""I know."" Sully's eyes met hers, pleading for understanding. ""But... I need you to promise me you won't tell anyone else about this.""

Nora felt her heart skip. Her stomach knotted.

A chill ran down her spine. She hadn't realized it until now, but Sully's warning had been a premonition of disaster. Something terrible was happening here on Presley's Promise.

""Of course,"" she said, not even sure what she meant. ""I'd never—""

Sully raised his hand, cutting her off.

326,0.6,0.6,1.0,95.0,5,46.0,"The dining hall lay at the end of a long hallway lined by rows of identical doors, each marked with a number. The only difference was the color of the door. With a sigh, Nora opened her assigned door and walked inside.

At first glance, the room resembled those in the dormitories. But it wasn't empty. A lone girl sat at a table near the center, eating a bowl of porridge.

Nora stifled a groan. There was no time for this. She couldn't afford to waste any more than she already had.

She made her way to the communal counter for her ration box. After filling her mug and pouring herself a bowl of porridge, Nora slipped back into her quarters to get ready for work.

As she finished dressing, she took one last look around the room. On her desk stood a small vid screen with an old, battered remote control. Beside it rested a pile of books and folders. A picture of her mother and father hung above the bed. She paused, then tucked them into the pocket of her jacket.

Nora lingered over the picture for a moment. Her parents had been among the first colonists, and they'd left behind everything they owned here. They died when Nora was young.

Nora's cheeks burned with shame as she realized how much she missed them. Despite their absence, the room felt like home now. The comforts of familiarity were comforting, but useless if she didn't make it through today.

Nora turned away from the picture and set out for the dining hall. As she passed her door, a pair of shorts caught on the doorknob. With an exasperated sigh, Nora pulled off the shorts and tossed them into a corner.

The dining room was crowded despite the hour. Nora spotted an empty table near the back. She sat down with her ration box and spooned some porridge into her mouth while she looked around.

A few tables had chairs, but most people preferred to eat standing up. A line stretched along the counter where a clerk filled orders. There was no sign of anyone else eating breakfast.

Nora ate quickly while scanning the crowd. The creatures who attacked the colony last night had not shown themselves again, but she couldn't afford to relax. She kept looking for signs of trouble as her stomach rumbled.

After finishing her bowl, Nora pushed it aside and began scanning the room again. The diners were an eclectic mix of colonists ranging from old people to children. All wore the same dark blue coveralls and matching hoods.

Nora's gaze fell on a group of young men sitting together at a table near the back. They sat with their backs against the wall, nursing steaming mugs and sipping tea.

Nora narrowed her eyes and focused. She knew these men. They worked for the Company.

She'd seen them before, but they hadn't seen her. As Nora watched, the leader of the group cast his eyes across the room and met hers. His expression hardened. Nora flushed with embarrassment and guilt.

The guys were drinking. At least one had a flask of liquor stashed somewhere.

Nora looked away, rubbing the back of her neck. She didn't have time for this. Not now.

327,0.6,0.7,1.0,83.0,5,47.0,"The corridors were lined with doors brimming with people working at their desks. The hallways were crowded with colonists coming and going, filling the air with a cacophony of conversation.

Nora passed by the dormitories on the way to the cafeteria, where she took her place in line. Her stomach rumbled as the hot meal of cereal and toast arrived. She grabbed a cup of coffee from the dispenser, then went to sit on one of the benches lining the cafeteria.

The halls were filled with noise as colonists chatted with each other. Nora's ears strained to pick out the words, but the din drowned them out. She sipped her coffee while she waited for the others in line to finish eating.

Nora glanced around the room. Most of the tables had been pushed to one side and turned into makeshift workstations, where colonists hunched over data screens. Several of the colonists sat together in small groups, talking quietly. One man stood alone and stared into the distance with hooded eyes.

She wondered if he was waiting for someone. Nora had learned long ago that a few minutes of isolation could be a good thing. She tried to relax her shoulders, and let the mug warm her hands.

A soft hiss startled Nora when the next person in line finished their meal. She looked up, but saw nothing amiss. The drone of conversation continued as the colonists returned to their tasks.

Nora checked her wristwatch. There were still fifteen more minutes until she left for work. Something about this morning felt off, but she couldn't put her finger on what it was yet. She kept her eyes focused on the passing faces as they moved through the cafeteria and out into the hallways.

Several colonists passed by Nora. They gave her curious glances, then moved on. A couple of them nodded politely. Some frowned at her, or even sneered with disdain. But none spoke to her.

Nora couldn't imagine why. If she was late for work, someone would probably tell her.

When Nora arrived at the engineering bay, she found that the other colonists were already in place. She waved hello to the three men who greeted her with friendly nods of acknowledgment.

""Morning,"" said the engineer, a man named Carter. ""You're early.""

""Yeah, I'm sorry. I overslept and didn't get to bed until two. Sorry.""

""That's okay. It happens. Let me know if you need any help with anything before your shift starts. We'll be ready for you when you are.""

Nora nodded in agreement, but she wasn't sure how much her own abilities would come into play. The colonists had lots of skills for emergencies, and Sully himself was often on call. Still, Nora wanted to do everything she could.

The building Nora worked in was a squat, blocky structure made from metal plates and grating. She walked along the cramped corridors, dodging between conduits and scorched rock walls. She ducked under the low ceilings, and swung over conveyor belts.

328,0.6,0.7,1.0,80.0,3,47.0,"The colony's expansive garage buzzed with activity as Nora entered. All the colonists worked in shifts, so the building hummed with the sound of people going about their business. Power loaders trundled along the concrete floors, picking up bits and pieces of equipment and hauling them back to the bays where repairs were made. This happened every morning around dawn.

Nora walked briskly through the corridors, noting the lack of any windows. The colonists did not want to see the outside world. A few steps later she arrived at the cafeteria, a small room lined with tables for eating and chairs for relaxing.

Nora stopped in front of one of the long benches to wait for someone else. She checked her wristwatch, which had been running since she woke up. It was five fifty-seven. Her shift would start in fifteen minutes.

""Good morning!"" someone called from behind her. Nora glanced over her shoulder. ""Hi, Bob. Good to see you.""

Bob was a tall man with a tangle of dark brown hair and a weathered face. He carried a large toolbox under his arm, wearing a faded gray coverall. ""Morning, Nora. How's it going?""

""Fine,"" she replied. ""You?""

""Not bad. I'm finishing up the last of the power regulators. They're all done but my replacement is coming in today, so I'll be out of here soon. What about you? Lots to do?""

Nora shrugged. She'd spent most of her life on this planet, and the work didn't really require a lot of thought.

""Oh, yeah. Just got to make sure everything's ready before the techs come in.""

""Sure thing."" Bob set down his tool box and stepped forward. ""Can I get anything for ya?""

""No thanks."" Nora shook her head. ""I'll just grab some breakfast.""

Bob nodded. ""That's what we should do. Get some grub."" He looked around and frowned. ""Where are the other colonists at anyway? We're supposed to meet in the common room, right?""

Nora turned and walked toward the far wall where a door opened into the bays. She stopped short when she saw where someone was sitting.

""Whoa!"" Bob exclaimed with an alarmed look. ""What happened to you?""

The man on the bench stared up at Nora, his eyes wide and glassy. His skin seemed translucent and pale. He wore old clothing—the same sort of coveralls worn by Bob. But there the resemblance ended. The man's clothes hung off him loosely and drooped from his frame. A deep gash ran along one side of his neck, exposing a white bone.

Nora stepped back in alarm. ""What happened to...?""

Bob put a hand on her shoulder. ""Easy. Let me take care of it.""

""What is he doing here?!"" Nora demanded. She felt sickened and overwhelmed. Her stomach churned. She wanted nothing more than to run away, but she couldn't leave the man like this.

Bob sighed. ""I don't know. Maybe the Company replaced the techs with zombies.""

""Zombies?""

""Yeah,"" Bob said. ""You know—those things they have in movies.""

329,0.6,0.7,1.0,68.0,5,47.0,"The corridors were dim, lit only by automated lights that flickered on when she passed them. The air held a faint tang of exhaust from the power plant. Her boots clomped along the metallic grating of the corridor, echoing resoundingly in the stillness.

The colony's dining hall was located at the far end of the residential wing, and while it wasn't crowded it did hold a few other colonists who were already awake. A long counter stretched through the middle of the room with rows of tables on either side, seating two people each. At present, there weren't many people eating.

Nora walked up to the nearest table and sat down, keeping one hand on the table edge as she took a deep breath to steady herself.

She spotted a couple of people sitting with their backs to her, but they didn't seem to be paying attention; they talked quietly among themselves and kept glancing back toward the serving line. Nora looked around for a server, found none, then decided to go ahead and order.

""I'll have...uh...a meatloaf sandwich, please.""

The automated response seemed to come from everywhere. ""Ordered,"" it said flatly.

A moment later the food arrived. Nora tore into her breakfast with enthusiasm, barely noticing that she was ravenous. After a few bites, she felt more like herself again, or at least closer.

Nora tucked away the last bite of her meal and was about to stand when a voice called out behind her.

She turned around in surprise, only to see three colonists standing there. Two were older men wearing work coveralls, each holding a tray with a plate of food balanced on it. The third man was much younger, his face half hidden under a mesh cap, and he carried a bottle of water.

Nora recognized him from the night before. He'd been drinking heavily, but now he looked better, if not entirely sober.

""You're Nora, aren't you?"" he asked. ""From the other night? I'm Martin.""

He held out his hand, and Nora shook it warily. His palm was rough, callused from working on machinery. She nodded, eyeing the bottles of water thoughtfully.

Martin shrugged. ""Well, it's your choice, but I saw you staring at our food and figured it was probably best to offer you some. We've got plenty. You don't have to share ours if you don't want to.""

Nora glanced down at her empty plate. Her stomach growled.

""How many of you are there?""

The two older men looked over their shoulders and laughed. ""Just us three,"" one of them said. ""We're just janitors, from the maintenance staff. We work for the Company, so we get fed whenever they bring in supplies.""

""Oh.""

""Yeah, pretty much anyone who works here gets fed. Not like back home, where everyone has to stand around waiting in line for hours."" The man gestured at the empty tables, shrugging. ""They still do that, but now it's automated and you don't even have to wait.""

Nora nodded.

The tiny windowpanes reflected the starlight, making it seem as if the entire room was bathed in cold white beams.

She paused at the door to the corridor leading back to the dormitories. While the colonists'quarters were cramped, they weren't so small that everyone had to share spaces. She walked past the rows of sleeping cots. Most of them were empty.

The hall ended with a large set of double doors marked Dining Hall. Nora opened them, stepped inside, and flipped on the lights.

A few tables sat in the center of the chamber, but most were still stacked with dishes from breakfast. A few tired colonists slumped over their meals. Nora passed between two groups and found a table in the far corner. She eased herself down onto its bench seat and stared out at the cliff tops.

Nora finished her meal quickly, then pushed her tray aside. She waited for a moment, watching the colony's other residents leave the dining hall, and then got up from her seat.

She headed straight for the dormitories. The corridors were short and narrow, and several times she had to squeeze through places that were barely wide enough to admit her shoulders. Before long, she reached the end of the corridor where the shared bathroom was located. The facility was smaller than the communal showers in the dormitory wing but it had to be used often.

She stepped into the room, flipped on the lights, and turned to lock the door behind her. She pulled off the utility pants and jacket before stepping under the shower head. The hot water made her skin tingle, but at least the steam helped cleanse away some of the grime.

After washing off as much dirt as possible, Nora dried herself with a rough towel and dressed again in her shirt and pants. She brushed her hair out of her face, grabbed an old pair of boots from the closet, and left the dormitories.

The next stop was the command center. She walked down one of the corridors and entered the tall metal structure without encountering anyone else on her way. The thick steel door swung shut behind her, locking the interior from intrusion.

Nora pressed the intercom panel beside the door. ""Good morning,"" she said. ""I'm coming in.""

""Thank you, Nora,"" a pleasant voice replied. ""Please enter and place your palm on the scanner to verify that you are who you say you are.""

She did so, then waited. After several seconds, the door slid open with a hiss of compressed air. Nora stepped inside and paused for a moment, surveying the room.

It was a large, circular chamber fitted out like a control tower. A bank of monitors hung above a central workstation with a row of computer terminals on either side. The walls were lined with banks of controls and switches.

A long, rectangular table stretched across the middle of the space. At its far end stood two male colonists in matching blue coveralls. They wore helmets and carried pistols. Nora recognized them from their nightly patrols around the colony.

The lights flickered green every few seconds, but the colonists tolerated it more for the convenience than the result. Nora passed through shades of pale blue to a brighter corridor full of gleaming white walls where she found herself in front of a large dining hall.

Nora entered the cafeteria, which was dimly lit by low-wattage bulbs set at irregular intervals along the ceiling. A long table of utilitarian wood extended out from the back wall near the door. Three rows of four chairs each lined one side of the room, facing each other in two pairs. At the far end of the line, a handful of colonists worked their way through enormous platters of food while others stood around eating from paper plates with plastic utensils.

Nora hurried down the aisle and took her seat on the right-hand row, watching as people filled up their plates from the variety of choices available. Nora ladled a spoonful of scrambled eggs onto her plate, then added several pieces of toast and some fruit that might have been kiwi or mango. She tasted it to make sure the real thing wasn't in there before taking a bite.

When she finished, Nora turned her attention to the menu card posted beside her place setting.

The breakfast menu offered a choice of three main courses: Eggs Benedict, Omelette Florentine, and French Toast Royale. The selections were divided into three sections for various types of food: Grain Products (cereal), Vegetable/Fruit, and Meat. Nora chose the grain products section, which offered a number of breads and pastas alongside a selection of cereals. She selected wheat flakes, apple cinnamon oatmeal, and a few other options. Then she looked over the protein section, which was also divided into categories: Fish, Chicken, Beef, Pork, Other Protein, and Mixed Protein. Of the latter group, she picked the mixed meats option. Her entire meal would cost twenty-two credits, but she had ten left after paying for her food.

After the main course came dessert. Nora settled on chocolate cake with ice cream and whipped cream, and topped it off with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. She paid her bill and collected her tray, then headed back to the dormitories where she usually worked.

As an engineer, Nora spent most of her time in the agricultural building, but she was often called upon to assist the technicians who maintained the colony's power plant, communications equipment, water purification systems, and waste processing plants. Today, Nora didn't expect she'd be working in any of those areas, so she was able to take a break from cleaning and laundry duty before heading back.

Nora walked down the long corridors while dodging people on their way out of the dining hall or walking toward the showers. When she reached the end of the main floor, Nora turned right at the junction and entered the smaller corridor that led to the engineering bays. At the other end of the hallway, she found the door to one of the bays marked with her nameplate.

At the entrance, Nora glanced around and saw a few colonists already inside.

332,0.6,0.7,1.0,83.0,4,42.0,"The corridor outside her room was dimly lit by a few strip lights hung from the ceiling, casting a soft glow across the red-brown metal surfaces. The predawn light highlighted the bandages wound around Nora's arms and legs, but they did little to conceal the extent of the injuries she'd suffered in the previous two days.

Nora paused, waiting for her eyes adjustment to readjust. Her eyes watered slightly at the slight sting, but the dust and grit in the air made her nose run too. She swiped at it with the sleeve of her jacket, then continued on.

The hallway ended at the front doors where a pair of guards stood watch.

Nora rapped her knuckles against the door frame, already expecting the guard to open it. He didn't.

""Hey!"" Nora called out as she knocked again. ""I'm supposed to start my shift in ten minutes.""

""You're late,"" said the first guard from inside the room. ""Get your ass down here, Decker.""

""Yeah, yeah, I know."" Nora sighed and walked back up the hall toward the showers. She dropped her gaze to her boots. They were scuffed and worn with use. She hated them. But they kept her feet safe.

The water was hot enough to make her feel awkward standing around naked in it. The shower curtain barely covered her modesty, leaving a view of her reflection. Nora ran one hand through the damp strands of her hair and flicked rainwater off her face with the other. She crossed her arms over her chest, trying to keep herself from trembling from the cold.

She sank into the tub and shut her eyes. The water made her relax. It wasn't soothing or relaxing, just a distraction. Nora used it to wash her hair, scrubbing away the grime and sweat.

The water turned tepid as she leaned against the wall of the shower stall. Her muscles relaxed further until she felt like she might pass out from exhaustion. Nora stood still, letting the hot water pour over her body.

It didn't work well. Too much effort. Not enough payoff. I'm too tired. I need sleep.

With a sigh, she stepped out of the shower and wrapped her towel around her waist before walking back to her quarters.

""Better?"" asked the guard on duty when she reached him. ""That's better.""

Nora nodded and walked past, turning down the corridor leading to her room. The guard opened the door for her, but Nora hesitated at the threshold.

The place stank. Like sweat and dirt and blood.

She stepped inside and froze. The floor was covered in a thick layer of dust, and the bedding had been stripped from the corners. Nora could smell the lingering scent of someone else's blood and guts from where she stood.

The guards must have done this while I slept. But why?

Nora shook her head and pulled the blanket from the foot of the bed, shivering as it left her barefoot.

333,0.6,0.7,1.0,88.0,7,51.0,"The colony's dining hall was a long, rectangular room lined with tables. To Nora, the room looked like a giant cafeteria. The empty seats on every table were still covered in plastic wrap. Atop each of the tables was a unitary plate of food, its contents obscured by the sheeting.

Nora walked up to one of the empty tables and sat down to eat. She took a bite of her meal, chewed, swallowed, then set down the tray. It was a single slab of meat that tasted odd but felt familiar.

She stood up again to look around.

The colony had few windows, so the only way to see outside was to walk down the concourse, past the dormitories, and out onto the landing field, where they could look through the fence at the landscape beyond.

It showed a desolate wasteland with rocky cliffs, jagged boulders, and narrow valleys filled with dark shadows. Clouds of dust, dirt, and debris swirled in the air above the ground, obscuring the sky.

Nora didn't know if the colony's location was good or bad. The area wasn't particularly desirable for prospecting, but it was close enough to the well-established mining operations on the other side of the planet that the Company sent supply ships regularly.

Nora had never been interested in exploring the world beyond her own little corner of space, but it seemed like a terrible idea now. Why would anyone voluntarily go out into such a dangerous place?

No one else was awake yet, and Nora had the whole day ahead of her. She decided to head down to the command center, where Sully would be working. He'd have to start the repairs before the supplies arrived, and he might need some help.

Nora put down her tray with a clatter, then grabbed the lid off her storage crate and pulled out a toolkit. The lid came away from the sturdy box easily, but there was nothing inside except for the blanket that protected the contents from the elements.

Nora looked around. There were no tools on the floor. Even if someone was here, they couldn't have left them behind. No one could get up here without being seen.

The only other option was that the Company had already sent the supplies, but that didn't seem likely. The last thing the Company wanted was to send defective equipment.

She shook her head at the thought and walked over to a nearby table, where a pair of work boots sat parked under the plastic cover. Nora smiled when she saw the mud scuffed onto the tops, and quickly checked for damage to the soles before putting them on.

After grabbing a utility belt with mounted pouches, she strapped it around her waist and slipped her arms into the sleeves of the jacket. She snapped closed the zippers along the front and back, then took a step forward to check the fit. A new garment was always a pleasure to wear.

Nora stopped suddenly, frowning. Her jacket had vanished somewhere in the transition from her quarters to the dining hall. When she looked down, the sleeve was hanging limply off her arm. Nora grabbed for the missing fabric, but the jacket had somehow disappeared from the table.

Sully's voice echoed through the colony, filling the halls and echoing between the walls.

334,0.6,0.7,1.0,87.0,5,49.0,"The dimly lit halls were empty save for a few people in the common room down at the end of each corridor, so she headed straight for the mess hall. She slid through the swinging doors and found it filled to capacity with colonists milling around a long table loaded with plates, bowls, glasses, utensils, coffee, and other food items. Even the small tables set up near the windows were packed. Nora's mouth watered as she looked over the peculiar assortment of dishes on display.

""Nora!"" A man tapped her shoulder from behind, but it took a moment for her to realize who he was. ""You're late.""

She turned and saw a tall woman with dark hair standing in front of the table, arms crossed expectantly. She wore pressed khaki pants and boots.

""Sorry,"" Nora said, pushing her way past him. The man let her pass without comment, but the woman glared daggers at her back as she walked by.

Nora wasn't sure if she should feel insulted or not. It was just the way things were here.

It had been a long time since she'd seen another human being. Just a few weeks ago, there had been three others working the farm. But two of them had died in a freak accident, and the third left for reasons unknown. The colony was still shorthanded, so the Company assigned her to work with the colonists that remained.

The colonists generally got along well enough, but they kept their distance. They spoke when necessary, but otherwise stayed to themselves. Nora was used to being alone, so she didn't mind.

She also spent most of her time on the farms growing nutritious crops or tending to the hydroponic greenhouses. She helped maintain the machinery and run the waste processors. When the weather permitted, she worked outdoors in the fields among the other colonists.

It was a good job. She liked the work. The company provided her with food, clothing, and shelter. And she could sleep whenever she wanted.

But Nora was always alert for new dangers. There were no more aliens on the planet, but the Company had never said why; just like the colonists, they sensed there might be something else out there... waiting.

Nora stood at the end of a row of plants and peered into the greenhouse through a window, checking to make sure everything was running smoothly.

She pressed her face against the glass to peer inside, drinking in the sight of rows and rows of lush, healthy crops growing. She loved this job. It was fulfilling work that kept her busy and active. Every day she grew something different, from vegetables to fruits to grains.

The crops were thriving. They needed little attention, and Nora got along well with the colony's other workers. She wasn't afraid of them, and they weren't afraid of her.

""Morning,"" a voice called from behind her. Nora turned around. ""Good morning!"" The woman smiled warmly at her. ""I'm Kelly.""

Nora nodded, smiling back. Kelly worked in the fields. Her hair was brown with a few streaks of gray, and her eyes were bright blue.

335,0.6,0.7,1.0,84.0,6,46.0,"The corridor outside the dormitories was dimly lit by the scattered glow of lights strung along the ceiling, but Nora could see well enough. Her eyesight had always been excellent.

Nora strode through the halls, past the engineering bays where colonists worked to repair their tools and equipment, toward the power plant. She didn't know what time it was, but she knew her shift started at seven.

The meeting hall was packed with people. Nora's steps slowed as she approached the front of the room. A handful of engineers sat around the long table in the middle, while a few others stood at the back near the entrance. The crowd of early risers was so thick that they filled the entire room, with more waiting outside in the corridor.

Nora hesitated, taking in the familiar faces, then turned to walk down the length of the center aisle. It wasn't the first time she'd seen this gathering. Every morning since joining the colony, Nora had been summoned to the meeting hall by the AI for her daily briefing on the state of repairs and maintenance.

She took a seat next to Sully near the head of the table. He was already scanning his tablet screen; he glanced up at her as if nothing unusual were happening.

""Morning, Nora,"" he said without turning away from the tablet. ""Did you sleep well?""

Nora shrugged, glancing around at the other engineers. Most looked bored as they stared at their tablets or the walls. Only Shari seemed interested in the discussion, and she was sitting with her arms crossed, twirling a pencil between fingers.

The rest of the room was full of colonists who had just finished working on the day's repairs. Some of them nodded at Nora, but most didn't even acknowledge her existence. She was used to it.

Nora pulled out her tablet and tapped the sensor pad, which started playing an audio recording of her briefing. She scanned the list of projects assigned to her team.

""All right, here we go,"" she muttered to herself. ""Power plant.""

A mechanical voice droned through the room as a scrolling graphic appeared on the screen. Nora squinted at the image as it scrolled past: the colony's power grid and the generator itself, with two main lines running down each side of the building.

""I guess they're going to run that for another few weeks,"" Nora said. ""The reactor is still holding out, but I don't want to push my luck.""

""They need to replace the entire system eventually anyway,"" Sully grumbled. He pointed at the screen. ""And this isn't helping with wear and tear.""

Nora glanced at him. ""Well, yeah, but..."" She shrugged. ""We can worry about it later if we have to. Right now, let's get back to work.""

She picked up her tablet and began searching through the list of projects.

Five hours later, she stood in the engineering bay, staring at the tools on the shelf beside her desk. Her team had already finished repairing the last of the damage from the day before. Now they were taking a break while several colonists worked on cleaning up the mess.

Nora sighed. She'd been working since dawn. It was time to head home and take care of herself.

336,0.6,0.7,1.0,86.0,5,47.0,"The corridors were dark as the lights flickered along the way, leaving grimy shadows to dance behind her every step. The air smelled like stale sweat and dust. And the whole thing was just depressing.

She passed by several other colonists heading in the same direction, their faces bleary from sleep. They nodded at her but said nothing. No one wanted to talk about what had happened last night. Not yet.

Nora turned the corner and nearly stumbled over a cluster of people gathered around the mess hall. Even though she'd been up early, the room was packed with hungry engineers. Some looked tired, others hungover. One woman sat hunched on the floor, arms wrapped around her knees. Her reddish hair was matted, and strands stuck to her face.

The smell of food hit Nora's nostrils. The scent made her stomach growl and her eyes water. She needed something in her belly.

""Morning,"" Nora croaked, pushing through the crowd.

A man stepped aside and Nora saw a massive metal platter piled high with steaming pancakes. A couple more men stood behind it, serving the food to several women, who'd already finished eating and were now cleaning plates and glasses.

""Breakfast?"" the man asked. ""You're working today.""

Nora glanced down at her work boots, then up again. She didn't think she could handle the workload without crashing. ""I'll eat later. I need to get some sleep anyway.""

The man nodded. ""Go ahead. I'll see you in there.""

Nora pushed through the crowd and found a table near the back of the room. The lights dimmed, and several people started talking. Nora sat quietly, trying not to let her mind wander off into daydreams of collapse. But the food was too good to resist. She dug in, feeding herself until she had no appetite left for anything else. Then Nora got to her feet and headed for the shower.

When she emerged from the restroom, Nora saw a group of colonists waiting outside the mess hall. They were holding incense burners and chanting in low voices.

She joined the procession, following the line of colonists up a winding set of steps to the top of the colony. There they passed through another door and climbed several more levels, ending at the command center.

The room stretched long beyond the walls, running the entire length of the building. The ceiling was vaulted, supported by rows of columns. A large window in one wall looked out over the colony. It showed the bare, rocky landscape under a thin layer of perpetual dust.

A few people stood around the room, talking. Others sat on the floor, heads bowed or eyes closed. Nora walked across the room and sat down beside them, joining a circle of people who were working with their hands, chanting softly.

337,0.6,0.8,1.0,89.0,5,46.0,"The hallway lights were dimmed to conserve power, but she could see well enough without them. Nora walked through the dormitory wing, passing rows of rooms filled with sleeping colonists. She moved past the communal bathrooms at the end of each hall, gently shutting doors behind her.

She paused outside her room when a shadow flickered in its window. Nora frowned. A drone? The black shape was too big and sinuous to be an insect, but what else could it be? Her hand went to the hilt of her service pistol, but she hesitated. If it wasn't hostile, then it might be a valuable resource—or even a friend. She couldn't leave a potential ally out there if it brought danger to the colony.

Nora opened her door and slipped inside, closing the door silently behind her. She switched on the light, setting the overhead panel to brightening. The walls and ceiling of the small room were painted a dull gray with red trim spots. It looked like an old schoolroom or administrative office.

Outside her bedroom door, Nora heard muffled voices from the shared bathroom at the end of the hall before the door closed again and the light faded back down. She sighed in relief.

""I'm sorry,"" she whispered under her breath. ""Please don't attack me.""

The room was empty. Nora crept to the window, where the foggy morning air obscured vision. She pressed her face to the glass and peered out into the darkness. The landscape was too distant for her to see through the haze. Then she saw movement, just out of sight.

Her pulse quickened. A drone? It couldn't be... could it?

Nora stepped away from the window and walked to the door. She turned the handle slowly, then pulled open the door a crack and peeked outside. She froze when she saw another figure standing in front of her room, silhouetted against the dim glow coming off the hallway lights.

Nora's heart hammered. This wasn't a drone. It was too big and sinuous, with an insectile body and black chitin covering its head and arms. Its legs were long and powerful, ending in razor-sharp claws. The creature raised itself up on its hind legs, swiveling its head to focus on Nora.

She swallowed hard. ""Hello?"" she said, her voice shaking.

It took the drone no more than three seconds to leap through the door and launch itself at Nora. Her eyes widened and her hands flew to her mouth.

The beast slammed into the wall in front of Nora, knocking her backward. She hit the floor with a thud and scrambled away from the door, casting about for something to defend herself.

338,0.6,0.8,1.0,67.0,7,45.0,"As she passed through the dormitory, she heard the low murmur of voices coming from the rec room. A few colonists were already up, probably making their way to the mess hall for the morning meal. The dark-haired woman paused at the end of the corridor, listening. She could hear them talking about someone named O'Neil.

""Hey, I saw him last night,"" said one voice. ""He's been working on the gantries—I think he's still doing that.""

""Yeah, but he can't be the only guy who knows how to weld. There are a lot of people out there who can do it.""

Nora frowned, thinking back. That had sounded like the name of a man.

She shook her head in puzzlement. Why would anyone work on construction when they could go into engineering? Engineers needed an education and certification, whereas tradesmen didn't need anything.

The woman drew closer, trying to remember more specifics from the conversation. She'd heard the name O'Neil, too. He was a good friend of hers, but she hadn't seen him around lately.

Maybe she'd just missed him...

Nora walked down the hallway toward the rec room, wondering where he might have gone off to.

* * *

""You're late,"" Sully said sternly. ""We've got a bioweapon attack coming in an hour. You want that job, you better start moving faster than this.""

Nora looked up from the computer screen. ""Sorry about that,"" she said, her tone apologetic. ""I got distracted looking for something out there.""

Sully grunted sympathetically. ""It's not your fault. We get reports of problems all the time. Everybody's busy.""

""Yeah, well..."" Nora tried to make eye contact with him but found herself frustrated instead. She returned her attention to the screen, which displayed a map of the colony. The red dot at the top indicated her position. A series of blue spots marked the location of the other colonists.

The layout of Presley's Promise was simple and efficient. Each building had an entryway, then a main corridor that split into two smaller passages. At each branching point were either three doors or one door leading to rooms on either side. Everything ran through the central concourse, which was connected to every room in the colony.

Nora's team worked out of the command center—a large circular structure in the middle of the colony. It housed the communications array, computer systems, and environmental controls for the entire community.

Nora stood beside Sully, who leaned over her shoulder as she studied a display of the colony's security system. The tiny red dots indicated the drone scouts. Every few minutes, several drones would swoop down from above and approach Presley's Promise from different directions. They circled around the colony like shy birds, waiting patiently until they came within visual range of the colony.

339,0.6,0.8,1.0,73.0,4,44.0,"For a moment she stood in the hall, staring at the door opposite her own room, contemplating the route to the mess hall. She shouldn't go alone. The colony's security system let her know when anyone left the dormitory, but it didn't seem right for a lone engineer to head out unescorted.

She turned back toward the stairs.

Nora descended the narrow stairwell with one hand on the railing, listening to the echoes of her footsteps. Reaching the bottom, she felt a wave of relief to see the lights were still on in the communal kitchen. At least that meant the colonists hadn't gone hungry yet today.

It was just as well. Nora was ravenous.

The small room bustled with activity and noisy chatter. She spotted several people from her team already eating breakfast, so she joined them.

Nora sat down next to a young man named Jason who seemed more cheerful than he had yesterday. He nodded at her greeting. ""All right, what's our status?""

""Good morning,"" Nora mumbled around a mouthful of food. She leaned over to speak quietly to Jason. ""I've got this one."" She pointed at an empty seat beside him. ""You can have my share when I'm done.""

Jason waved her off cheerfully. ""No need. It's on me, Nora.""

Nora smiled faintly and returned to her breakfast.

Nora ate in silence, chewing mechanically while she watched the others chat. They all seemed to know each other well enough, but they didn't seem particularly close. She felt a pang of loneliness.

When Nora finished the last bite of food, Jason spoke up. ""So... you're the new engineer? Hey, I'm glad we finally get someone decent. The old gal was always running out on us for some reason or another.""

Nora blinked. ""What do you mean?""

Jason sighed. ""She'd go away on those supply runs. Not even say good bye to anyone. You know, just vanished like she never existed.""

Nora wanted to ask why. But Jason was talking about a different engineer from the one she had replaced, so she couldn't very well demand answers. She gave him an encouraging smile instead. ""Well, I'm sure it wasn't your fault.""

Jason shook his head. ""She left because of me. I told her I thought the system wouldn't hold together long without maintenance. She said, 'You'll be fine.'But she quit a few days later. Said she was going home.""

Nora swallowed hard. ""I see,"" she murmured.

Jason nodded. ""Yeah, I do too. Now if only we could keep this place working for another three months while my parents send more supplies..."" He trailed off with an awkward laugh.

Nora started to respond, but the kitchen doors opened and a man stepped inside. Nora looked up in surprise to see her replacement enter. The man's blond hair was cut short and he sported a neatly trimmed beard.

340,0.6,0.8,1.0,60.0,6,49.0,"Outside, she found the colony's only dining hall already filling with people milling about in an orderly fashion for the morning meal. The smell of food made her mouth water.

She paused at the door to catch her breath, distracted by the number of colonists inside. Most were crew members from Company ships stationed in orbit around the planet. They'd been assigned to the colony to handle repairs, maintenance, and construction.

Nora was used to seeing the vast majority of the human population as drones. Crewmembers were interchangeable parts. But they weren't alone. There were other residents here, too, mostly young women who worked in the hydroponics section or in laboratories on medical research.

Nora wasn't sure how many people lived in the colony. She'd never counted them or tried to guess their total numbers. But it seemed like an awful lot for one small settlement.

In the back of her mind was a darker question. How did the Company know there are so many people living on this planet?

Maybe the colony was uninhabited. That might explain why the Company sent a full ship of military personnel—not just a few soldiers and repairmen.

But no. It would've taken weeks for a Company ship to arrive here, even if they knew where the colony was located. So why send a whole fleet? And what about the Company's secretive nature? Would it really risk its secrets by sending only a handful of elite troops?

So she had to assume that they'd found the planet already inhabited. But how? Did they find some kind of signal left behind by the first colonists, or did the Company spy on the planet from orbit before they landed?

Which raised the bigger question: Why was the Company here at all?

It didn't make sense. The Company didn't need Presley's Promise. If anything, there were plenty of other planets out there ripe for colonization.

Nora shook her head. She couldn't think about it now. She needed to eat something first.

The dining hall was dimly lit but clean. A few people sat at tables along the walls talking quietly in hushed tones. Most of them wore light jumpsuits like hers.

She edged past the long rows of seats to a table near the door and waited for her eyes to adjust. Then she picked up a tray loaded with half-cooked chunks of food and slid into one of the open seats.

Nora took a bite of scrambled eggs. They were cold. The taste was bland, but solid. She chewed slowly and swallowed before looking around again. Everyone else seemed occupied with their own meals.

She sighed. There wasn't much of an appetite left after the last shift. But there was no point in being hungry if you weren't going to eat anything anyway.

Her stomach rumbled as she finished off the rest of her breakfast. She slung the empty plate across the table and stood up.

As Nora walked through the corridor toward the hydroponics section, she became aware of activity ahead.

341,0.6,0.8,1.0,67.0,4,47.0,"The halls were quiet this early in the morning, but Nora noticed the lights flickering from time to time. Her footsteps echoed hollowly as she walked along the dim corridors.

Nora paused at the front desk, where Sully lounged behind it. Although he was a cheerful sort, he was also a stickler for punctuality. He'd been known to walk around the colony in search of late workers until they showed up.

""Morning, Nora,"" he said cheerfully. ""You're here a little early.""

""I know. I'm just going to get my breakfast and then head to the power plant. You want me there?""

Sully nodded absently. He turned his attention back toward the console, where a tall figure stood over it in white lab coat and dark hair.

Nora recognized Director Chen from her picture on the Company's website. The woman looked older than in the picture, but her face was still pretty and attractive. Nora had seen a few pictures of her on Presley's Promise since she arrived here.

""Good morning, Director.""

""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora walked past the director and continued down the hall. She could see Sully watching her go with a smile on his face.

The cafeteria was bustling as Nora entered. A thin trickle of colonists were already filing into the room, but there was plenty of space for more people. A young man in a blue uniform waved at Nora, who returned the greeting. He was part of the maintenance crew.

""Hey, Kathy!"" the man called out to a woman sitting at one of the tables. ""You need to pick up your order right away.""

Nora frowned. Wasn't there supposed to be a delay before the food came? She didn't recognize the name, but that wasn't unusual. The Company's entire staff numbered less than two hundred.

""I'll get it,"" Nora said. ""Thanks.""

She headed over to the counter where the cafeteria worker sat. The girl behind the register was short and slender with red hair pulled into a tight ponytail. As Nora approached, she picked up the tray and set it on the counter.

""Here you are, miss.""

Nora looked down at what was inside the box. She grimaced in distaste. Breakfast consisted of three slices of bread smeared with jam and a cup of tea.

""Sugar?"" asked the girl.

Nora shook her head, then looked up at the girl. ""What about cooked eggs or meat?""

The girl's eyes widened. She glanced over her shoulder, then turned back to Nora with a panicked look. ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can't have any meat here.""

""Why not?"" Nora demanded.

The girl hesitated for a moment before answering. ""Because... because...""

Nora gripped the edge of the counter in frustration. ""Is this some kind of joke? I've been on this planet two weeks! How do I get any protein unless there's a cow around somewhere?""

342,0.6,0.8,1.0,79.0,5,45.0,"The dormitory hallways were almost empty at this early hour. The steady clink-clank of Nora's boots echoed off the walls as she walked. She stopped in front of a door marked 'SHOWER—DELTA' and rapped on it lightly.

""Come!"" A muffled voice called back from inside.

She smiled with relief at the sound of the familiar gruff drawl. ""Breakfast is ready.""

The door opened to reveal Sully Carmichael, the colony administrator. He was a large man with broad shoulders and brown hair cropped short. His face was burnished by the sun, creased around deep-set eyes set under bushy brows.

""Good morning,"" he greeted Nora. ""Grab a seat while I get you some food. You've got work to do today.""

Nora nodded. ""I'll be right there.""

Sully waved her through the doorway and closed it behind him. Nora trudged down the corridor until she reached a cafeteria where half a dozen people were already seated. She took the last open chair at a table at the end of the row.

The cafeteria was sparsely furnished but clean. The tables and chairs were simple metal, plastic, or composite materials with hard edges and thin padding for comfort. Food dispensers hummed nearby, each one stocked with various combinations of breakfast staples.

A young woman sat across from Nora, tapping at her tablet screen as she read. When Nora looked up, she recognized her. They worked together in the power plant, a skilled engineer named Anna. They'd met when they first arrived on Presley's Promise. Anna had dark brown hair and green eyes, which made Nora think of a cat. She wore a plain white shirt with a black jacket over it.

Nora felt like an outsider.

She wasn't used to this small community yet. In fact, Nora was still trying to find her place here. She didn't know anyone well enough to feel comfortable asking questions. It was easier just to do what she was told, and hope for the best.

Before Nora could ask about Anna, a chime sounded. The cafeteria doors opened and Sully walked in. He nodded politely to everyone, then took his seat at the head of the table.

""Good morning,"" he said. ""You're all off duty today. Enjoy yourselves.""

Nora smiled at him, but then remembered that she was supposed to be working. She looked down at her tablet and saw a message. 'Power plant, noon.' She sighed, resigned.

The rest of the day would be a repeat of yesterday. Nora would work until lunch, eat, and come back for more. Maybe she'd get lucky and not have to go out in the field again.

But Nora knew that luck wouldn't keep her alive.

After breakfast, Nora headed to the power plant with trepidation. She trailed Anna into the engineering bay, where several people were already hard at work.

Anna looked up from her tablet and waved to Nora. ""Hey! Glad you could join us!""

Nora shrugged awkwardly, unsure how to respond.

343,0.6,0.8,1.0,62.0,4,45.0,"Nora's boots clunked as she made her way past the rows of sleeping colonists. Most were still asleep, just emerging from their dormitory beds to find coffee brewing in the communal kitchen. The smell of fresh baking wafted through the air along with the tangy scent of a freshly brewed pot of coffee. A few other colonists walked by carrying rations, but Nora found the idea of eating at this time too disgusting to contemplate.

She walked past the dormitories and then entered the mess hall. Around her, the room slowly filled with people who looked like they had slept in their clothes. There wasn't much space to eat, though, so every table was full of colonists.

""Good morning!"" one of the cooks called out cheerfully. ""I'm glad you're up, I've got your breakfasts ready.""

Some of the colonists around Nora groaned in annoyance and picked up trays. Others ignored the cook and kept working on their food, barely looking up. Nora sat down at a nearby table and took her tray.

The smells of eggs and bacon woke her appetite. She dug into breakfast as she listened to the chatter around her.

""How's it look today?"" asked a familiar voice from across the room.

Nora turned. Her friend Deanna stood beside her, her dark hair swept back in a short ponytail.

""Hi,"" Nora said with a smile. She ate another forkful of scrambled eggs, trying not to let her hunger show. ""Not bad, actually.""

Deanna huffed out an amused laugh. ""That sounds about right. They put enough grease in there to make a bear wanna hibernate for a year. But I'll take it, if you're telling me the truth.""

""Only my mom could use so much fat in a recipe."" Nora smiled at the memory, but then shook her head. ""No, I mean it. At least there aren't any more monsters on the surface this morning. How's that workin'out for you?""

Deanna shrugged, her dark eyes sparkling with amusement. ""It works out great. The whole colony is dead as doornails. I'm sorry to say, though. We might've managed without it.""

Nora grimaced. ""If we don't get some new tech soon, we're gonna be screwed.""

""I know,"" Deanna said seriously. ""We keep the old stuff up and running because it's too big a risk to change everything now. And even if we did, we'd still need to find something better.""

Nora chewed thoughtfully. ""Maybe we should talk about it with the Company.""

Deanna raised an eyebrow. ""Oh? Why would they listen to us?""

""Well...maybe because we're the only ones who can fix what goes wrong.""

Deanna laughed. ""Yeah, right. I'll give you one thing, Nora. You're pretty sharp when you want to be.""

Nora frowned.

344,0.6,0.8,1.0,71.0,6,46.0,"The colony's infirmary was tucked close to the dormitories. Although it wasn't always necessary to get the best engineer for every repair job, Nora had found herself working there more than any other part of the structure. She liked knowing the layout of the place better than she knew anything else about the little community, and at the end of a long day, the infirmary usually felt like home.

She walked past the cafeteria where colonists ate together, laughing and chatting over coffee or tea. Nora hesitated, then turned back toward the dining hall. She was hungry. But first she wanted to check on Sully.

The gray-haired man sat in his office, which resembled a large, well-appointed living room. The walls were lined with bookshelves displaying many volumes of technical manuals and reference texts. A few flat screens hung from the ceiling, showing surveillance footage of the rest of the colony in action.

Sully wore a dark suit and a white shirt. His graying hair was combed straight back off his forehead, accentuating a strong widow's peak. He looked up when Nora came into the room. ""Morning.""

""Hey,"" Nora said, sitting down. ""You're looking chipper this morning. What's got you so spiffy?""

Sully smiled thinly. ""Nothing much, really. Just making sure I'm ready for the day. You know how it is.""

Nora nodded, though she didn't entirely understand. She'd never been the type of person to worry about an upcoming shift.

The colony's infirmary might be a medical facility, but its personnel were engineers. Nora was a specialist in environmental systems. No one expected her to get sick.

She made a mental note to ask Sully more about his routine later. It seemed weird to have someone who worked in the field share a doctor's office with him.

""Well, what are we doing today?"" she asked.

Sully shrugged. ""Just keep your eyes open for anything interesting. We usually get another new shipment of supplies soon, and I want to make sure everything's in working order before the delivery arrives.""

Nora nodded. ""Any other surprises coming?""

""Yeah. Some Company execs will be here tomorrow to do a little brainstorming session. They'll probably want me to show them around the colony."" He grimaced. ""And I don't really wanna go, but with you gone...""

Nora made a face and shook her head, smiling sympathetically at his discomfort. She knew how he felt.

Sully sighed. ""I guess it's only a matter of time until they try to take over the whole colony. I'm not sure if I should be happy or scared about that.""

Nora looked into his eyes, trying to see past the mask of stoicism to what lay beneath. The man had an easygoing manner that didn't quite fit with his profession, but she liked him anyway. He was friendly but also firm when necessary.

""We're not going to let it happen,"" Nora said confidently. ""The Company won't just sit back and watch us die while they collect their profits.""

345,0.6,0.8,1.0,84.0,6,49.0,"The narrow hallways were dimly lit by dimly operating lights. The colonists had plenty of time to get their morning chores done before the sun rose, but they worked hard anyway. This early in the morning, Nora saw only a few people moving about. Most of them looked like she did, asleep.

She passed others still in bed with blankets tossed over their heads, and other colonists who slept with eyes wide open, facing the walls. Some of these had to be dreaming, because they didn't move at all. One such sleeper was a man Nora used to know named Ollie Gage. He didn't look so much like Nora's former boyfriend anymore, but he'd been handsome once—and more than that, kind.

Ollie. She missed him now. Nora thought of the last time she'd seen him as she passed his room, when she stopped to check on the status of a new piece of equipment. He'd been agitated and angry with her for some reason, and she hadn't understood why. She left without saying anything.

The corridors smelled of stale sweat and dust and metal. The air felt too thin for humans to breathe long enough to notice, let alone appreciate.

Nora breathed shallowly, the same way she might while working on a delicate machine. Her heart hammered, and her breath came in gasps. No matter how many times she told herself it was nerves, her stomach churned.

She reached the central hub of the colony, where the fusion reactor hummed and boomed. It was a large room with a vaulted ceiling and several porthole windows looking out over the surrounding terrain. A few colonists had already gathered there to eat breakfast.

The Hub was an open space, devoid of furniture or decoration. At the far end were two doors leading to the galley and kitchen facilities. The tables and chairs in the center were built into the floor, and a cafeteria line stretched down one side.

A trio of children sat at one table, playing cards on one of their own devices. They were young—too young to be out this early. Nora passed them by with a nod, though they looked up when she did so. Their eyes were round and dark like her own.

She turned and walked toward the cafeteria line, which moved slowly because most people had only a single meal to get through before starting work.

The food was basic fare, but plentiful. A healthy diet of protein bars and vegetable soup kept everyone fed, no matter how remote the location. Most of the energy came from the fusion reactor and solar panels on the roof, while the rest was supplied by hydroponic greenhouses.

Nora paused at the end of the line to wait for her turn. She'd made it a point not to eat breakfast. Her stomach felt queasy, and she didn't want to risk eating anything now. She stood with her hands clasped behind her back, staring at the floor ahead of her feet.

She shouldn't have been surprised. This was probably what happened when you went off-shift after nearly three years on call. But she still had trouble believing it.

346,0.6,0.8,1.0,91.0,6,41.0,"Nora walked past the dormitory and up the central stairwell to the colony's power plant, where she retrieved her locker key from a small box beside a large window looking out over the grounds. She turned the handle on the door, opened it, and entered the large room.

Inside were rows of lockers lined along the walls. Each locker held clothing, shoes, personal items, and other supplies. The air inside was stale with disuse.

Nora selected a locker at random and slid the key inside. The locker swung open. Inside was a single item. Nora picked it up, checked its label, then frowned in surprise.

A simple gold medallion hung on a chain around her neck. A diamond the size of her thumbnail sparkled in the center. Nora lifted the medallion from its hook, pulled the chain over her head, and fastened the clasp on her left collarbone. She brushed dust off the front of the medallion and inspected the gemstone for damage. It looked okay.

Nora tucked the medallion into her pocket. Then she pulled the door shut and locked it with a click. She slipped the key back into its box, grabbed her backpack from the locker, and walked out the door.

The colony's power plant stood at the top of three giant steps. Atop them were walkways leading to the gutted remains of old buildings, now used as workshops and storage rooms. The main concourse connected several of these buildings together. Nora climbed two sets of stairs and emerged onto the third level.

She found herself in a long corridor, which led straight down to the power plant and garage. A doorway at the far end of the hall opened on a wide space filled with vehicles. Nora stepped inside the garage and approached the closest vehicle.

Nora paused and studied the machine. It was an oversized four wheeled jeep with a flatbed trailer attached. The vehicle had smaller wheels than most, and a streamlined body. Its passenger compartment was wider and longer than the others and could seat up to five people side-by-side.

Nora reached out and touched the dash. She ran her fingers across the metal surface, along a contoured glass panel, and over a colorful holographic display. All of the vehicle's controls seemed to be integrated into this one panel.

The vehicle's computer system hummed like a small insect under Nora's hand. She glanced at it, then went back to running her fingers over the dash.

""Hello,"" said Eve.

Nora jumped and dropped her hands to her sides. ""Eve?"" she whispered.

""Yes, Nora.""

""Are you... real? I mean really real?""

""Of course.""

Nora relaxed with a deep breath and let out a slow sigh. Then she turned toward the voice and saw Eve standing beside her vehicle.

The artificial intelligence appeared human-like, but it stood taller than Nora, which made her seem shorter. Its smooth skin was pale white and unmarked, its features delicate and feminine. It wore a simple black dress with a high collar. A thin gold chain hung around its neck.

Despite the difference in height, the two women looked very much alike. Both were tall and slender, with dark hair and green eyes.

347,0.6,0.9,1.0,91.0,6,43.0,"The colony's dining hall was a long, narrow room carved out of the rock cliff to provide shelter from weather and visitors. The hall had a row of tables and chairs along one side, while the opposite wall held two rows of bunks, each occupied by at least three people. A tall, arched doorway led to the exit.

She passed through the archway toward the rumbling sound of breakfast being served. Nora liked the smell of hot food. Her stomach growled in anticipation.

The kitchen area was a wide corridor lined with sinks, cooking stations, storage lockers, pressure cookers, microwaves, cafeterias, and refrigerators. Along the walls were large metal cabinets that doubled as counters for preparing meals.

Nora stopped in front of the first sink on her right to rinse off the grime of the night before. After rinsing her hands and face, she opened the door to the locker beside the sink and started digging for utensils.

Before she could find anything, a loud warning buzz pierced the air, followed by a mechanical grinding noise. The lights flickered overhead, giving the kitchen an eerie green hue. Orange emergency lighting flashed across the ceiling, illuminating Nora's dark-red hair and the wall behind her.

Nora looked around frantically, trying to locate the source of the alarm. She snatched up a handful of knives and forks from the cabinet. Before she could take more than a few steps toward the exit, someone grabbed her arm.

""What are you doing?"" Valentina demanded into Nora's ear. ""Get back inside.""

Nora sucked in a breath. Valentina had appeared out of nowhere, standing next to the kitchen counter. The Latina officer wore her uniform, complete with the insignia of rank badges and medals. She also carried an assault rifle slung over one shoulder. Her dark brown eyes glowed like coals as they glared at Nora.

Nora pulled her arm free and backed away. ""I'm just going to get breakfast,"" she said. ""I have work to do.""

Valentina snorted. ""You're not leaving this area until I say so. This is an emergency.""

Nora sighed. ""Yeah, well...""

She pulled her jacket shut and faced the officer. Valentina's face was hard with a scowl. She planted herself solidly between Nora and the door to the hall.

""This isn't the military, Lieutenant,"" Nora said. ""We don't follow orders every time somebody comes up short on coffee. You can stand here all day if you want. But I'll be getting breakfast.""

""Fine."" Valentina's voice was clipped. ""Just remember what I told you last night.""

Nora turned to see the officer walk away. She frowned in annoyance and followed. The kitchen area wasn't large, but it took a while for her to reach the exit.

Nora walked out into the hallway as the warning buzz faded away. As the lights returned to normal, she glanced down at her watch and groaned. Late.

The morning shift would already be starting their work. Nora didn't want to deal with any of them right now, so she headed up the stairs instead.

348,0.6,0.9,1.0,66.0,6,44.0,"The colony's main thoroughfare was paved with gleaming white tiles. The walkways were busy with people, robots, and vehicles passing back and forth in a steady stream. Nora stepped along the concrete surface of the corridor. Her eyes darted to the horizon through gaps in the perimeter wall, where she could see the rocky land stretching out behind the colony.

The sun was just beginning to rise, filtering golden light across the landscape as she passed the command center. She paused to watch the early morning horizon. On her left were the dormitories, their gray walls topped with rows of tiny windows filled with thick panes of glass. They reminded Nora of prison cells.

On the right side of the corridor, the colony's power plant, greenhouses and laboratories occupied the space between two tall rectangular buildings. Nora hurried past the low-lying structures as she headed toward the cafeteria. She didn't want to be late for breakfast.

Nora entered the cafeteria and found it bustling with activity. Workers bustled about carrying trays full of food. In one corner, a group of people sat around a table and ate while drinking drinks from plastic cups. Nora caught a fleeting glimpse of a woman in a formfitting blue bodysuit, but the people in charge wouldn't let her linger too long.

She quickly scanned the room and spotted a line at the buffet counter, where she could grab something to eat. Nora walked up to the buffet counter, where the servers unloaded stacks of bowls and platters onto a tray. One of the servers noticed her and nodded. He began helping Nora find what she wanted.

""What do you recommend?"" Nora asked as she picked up a bowl of some kind of porridge.

""It's all good,"" the server said. ""How about eggs? You like scrambled or fried.""

Nora looked disapprovingly at the scrambled eggs. The server must have seen it in her face.

""I'll take three scrambled,"" Nora said, looking away before he could see her grimace.

The server placed the food on a plate and handed it to Nora. Nora thanked him, then sat down with her breakfast. A small group of people seated themselves near Nora's table. She didn't recognize any of them. They were dressed in loose-fitting jumpsuits and boots.

Nora wrinkled her nose at the smell of their food. It was almost exactly what she'd eaten for dinner last night, but now she felt queasy. She took another bite and tried not to gag as the taste hit her tongue.

She glanced around the cafeteria again, this time noticing that everyone here seemed to be eating at once. There wasn't much room to move. Nora eyed the other patrons who had taken seats while they waited for their meals to arrive. Some of them already finished their food and tapped on their trays. Now that Nora thought about it, the servers were moving very slowly.

""You're late,"" one man said, his voice echoing through the cafeteria.

349,0.6,0.9,1.0,91.0,4,48.0,"Upon reaching the cafeteria, Nora paused at the entrance to take in a new scent. A sharp tang in the air made her nose twitch. She inhaled deeply, enjoying the smell of coffee brewing. Her stomach growled, reminding her it had been a while since she last ate.

Nora entered the large room filled with long tables. At the center of the room was the counter where cooks prepared food for the colonists to eat. All around were rows and stacks of seats, mostly empty. The cafeteria itself seemed perpetually full to Nora, perhaps because the food arrived fresh daily rather than the stale, processed stuff from storage.

A handful of people sat at one table near the back of the room, but most everyone else stood around waiting for their turn to order. Nora meandered over to the nearest table and took a seat next to an older woman with short blonde hair and a friendly smile. She glanced up and smiled.

""Good morning.""

""Morning,"" Nora replied, then looked down at her tray. ""I didn't even get breakfast yet.""

The other woman chuckled. ""You don't have to worry about waking early when you work on the farm."" She gestured toward the large window behind her. ""It's too dark out there to see anything.""

Nora followed the gesture. Outside was a mountain range obscured by clouds and a foggy haze. In the distance, she saw lights flashing from a ship approaching the planet.

""What kind of farm do they need an engineer for?"" Nora asked.

Her companion laughed. ""They're pretty much self sufficient. They grow crops in the fields, process waste products, recycle water, and make their own fuel.""

""How many colonists are here?"" Nora asked.

""Just over a hundred. There used to be more, but it's getting harder and harder to find supplies for them."" The other woman leaned forward and lowered her voice. ""Things are worse every day, but we can only hope the Company sends more ships soon.""

Nora nodded. ""I'll get started on my shift."" She stood and headed for the serving line. As Nora reached the front counter, an alarm sounded overhead. A red light flashed on the wall.

The server at the front of the line turned and looked up. ""We have a problem!""

Nora ran toward the exit. She paused just outside to look back. All around the cafeteria, colonists dove off their seats or rushed out the door. People were shouting and screaming, running in panic.

""What is it?"" Nora asked.

The young woman shook her head. ""There's something in the air. In the vents. Something bad.""

""Is this some kind of attack?""

""I don't know, but we have to get everyone out of here now!""

Nora grabbed the nearest person and shoved him toward the exit. He stumbled and fell, then scrambled to his feet and joined Nora in pushing people into the hallway.

A woman with short brown hair screamed in terror as they ran past her. Nora glanced at her face, but couldn't tell if anything was wrong.

350,0.6,0.9,1.0,79.0,5,45.0,"Nora caught sight of herself in the mirror as she passed. Her face looked drawn, dark circles under her eyes. She grimaced at the appearance.

Dieting wasn't working. Maybe I should try sleeping more...

She rubbed her face and sighed. No. That would be worse.

Outside, the chill morning air hit like a slap. She shivered as she walked away from the door, feeling exposed without her vest. A cold mist rose off the ground in clouds that condensed around her ankles. The morning fog seemed to cloy the very air. As her boots crunched over the frozen surface, Nora felt the faint pressure of each step through her soles, but it was too subtle to detect when she listened for it.

Nora reached the end of the dormitory hall and turned right, then left again. She headed toward the communal showers along the back wall of the building, where an open doorway let her see a small room with a row of lockers set into one corner.

The shower doors had been removed so colonists could use the stalls instead. Nora looked about for anyone else before unlocking her locker and stepping inside. She pulled out the items she needed—a towel, soap, shampoo, and rags to scrub herself down—and washed quickly before pulling on her uniform.

Nora walked briskly across the grounds, not wanting to waste any time after waking up. She reached the maintenance shed at the far side of the colony, where the drone repair bay still hummed quietly in the predawn darkness.

She stepped inside and shut the door behind her. The air smelled like oil and metal, a familiar scent that comforted Nora.

A red light blinked overhead, indicating the bay's status. It was an older model, but the systems were well maintained and the equipment reliable. The pressure suits hanging neatly on hooks alongside the walls had been cleaned. A pair of bright green lights flashed from the rear of the bay, which meant the drones were ready to begin repairs.

Nora opened a panel beside the door and removed a small gray box. She tapped it once with her thumb and the device chirped twice before beginning to speak.

""Good morning, Nora."" The machine sounded like an old man. ""I have just been informed that you will be working remotely today.""

""All right,"" Nora said. ""You can tell me what I need to know later.""

The Rolodex let out a long, slow sigh. ""Thank you. Today's work involves the maintenance of our drone repair bay.""

Nora frowned. That was where the Company had sent her, but she hadn't expected this kind of work.

""What's wrong?"" asked the Rolodex.

Nora shrugged. ""Nothing."" She couldn't explain why she felt so uneasy. Maybe it was because the project wasn't exactly familiar or necessary for their survival.

351,0.6,0.9,1.0,87.0,5,45.0,"The air outside felt cold, but not frigid, as she crossed the grounds to the mess hall behind a row of prefabricated buildings. The sound of clanging metal announced her arrival at the door marked 'Mess Hall'. At the end of the short line, Nora waited until another engineer opened the door.

She placed the duffel bag with its tools and supplies on the counter, then followed the other colonists inside to claim a seat. This morning was like every other morning, except that the other engineers were already seated around their breakfast tables when Nora arrived.

The food smelled delicious. A hearty stew simmered over a large pot in the center of the room. Other people sat with plates stacked high or sipped from mugs of steaming coffee. Nora grabbed a mug off one of the trays and took a seat next to the window in the back corner. The table was filled with six empty seats and two places set for more people.

Nora looked across the room, watching as the cooks served up breakfast. There seemed to be a lot of noise and activity. She sighed. It wasn't fair that she had to work so hard just to keep everyone fed. What if something happened? Would they starve to death because no one could fix the equipment?

No matter how many times Nora thought about it, nothing made sense. The Company always said they would take care of everything. How could they possibly fail on this planet?

After a moment's contemplation, Nora focused her attention on the food and ate without tasting it. Her stomach growled loudly enough for several nearby colonists to look at her. When she glanced around, her eyes met those of a man at the next table over. He wore a white shirt with rolled sleeves, and his hair was dark brown and cropped close to his skull. Nora knew him from the power plant shift. His name was David, and he was a friend of hers.

She smiled at him and gestured toward her empty plate. ""You eat too?""

David nodded to her as he started eating. In response, Nora grabbed a spoon and scooped up some stew. She lifted the mug of coffee to her lips, but didn't drink any. Instead she dropped the spoon into her bowl. The grease splashed across the table with a heavy thud.

Her messmates were starting to stare. Nora glared back at them, then stood and walked out of the mess hall.

The cold air bit through her clothes. Nora adjusted her jacket, trying to keep warm as she went down the road that led to the power plant. At the end of the walkway, she stopped in front of the garage.

A bored young man sat behind a desk inside the office. He was a short, stocky teenager with messy black hair and a goatee beard. He wore thick, gray work gloves and a plain white shirt and pants without insignia. A large wrench lay on his desk.

""Good morning,"" Nora said. The teenager stared vacantly at her, but made no reply. She sighed and brushed past him to get to the garage bay.

Nora pulled open the door to find a few people already working.

352,0.6,0.9,1.0,76.0,5,45.0,"The dormitory corridors were dimly lit. Slanted orange lights set in the walls ran along the ceiling, but they flickered in defiance of any power supply. The floors were finished with some kind of gray composite material that felt much like metal underfoot, though it was so thin and fragile she couldn't imagine standing on them for long.

Nora's footsteps came loud and clear in the empty hallways. She passed several colonists coming out of their rooms, yawning and stretching. They nodded at her as she went by.

They weren't exactly friendly with each other. A few knew her name. But most didn't. She was a stranger to them. And it showed in the way they looked at her. Stonily. Frowning.

Nora had lived too long among strangers. She stopped outside the communal showers, where dozens of women gathered. The walls and floor were the same dull gray composite as the rest of the hallway. They reminded Nora of industrial spaces, but these people used them for something more intimate.

With a sigh, Nora entered the shower area. The air was thick with steam, making her eyes sting and her nose run inside her mask. She dropped her clothes on a nearby bench and stepped into one of the cubicles.

The water pressure was strong enough to spray her from head to toe. While hot, it wasn't scalding. Nora took off her mask and let the warm water wash away her fatigue and stress. It felt good.

She stepped out of the shower. She toweled herself dry, then slipped back into her clothing and boots. Her hands trembled as she buttoned up her shirt. She rubbed her tired face with the towel again.

Nora passed a group of colonists who were gathering at the cafeteria for breakfast. They greeted her without enthusiasm, but they weren't hostile either. She headed in the direction of the command center kitchen.

The hallways around the central concourse were bright and clean. Nora walked through them, passing doors marked with letters of the alphabet. She paused briefly at each, noting the name on her calendar before moving onto the next.

All the rooms here belonged to Company staff, not colonists. The first two rooms were empty but for a few pieces of furniture. After that Nora saw people sitting down to eat.

Her stomach growled audibly as she came across the fourth door on her route. She stopped outside the last of the rooms and tried the knob. It turned easily under her hand.

Nora pushed open the door. She found herself in a small, irregularly shaped room. A table sat in the middle of the floor. Beyond it was an opening into the command center's main area.

The lights were dim, even at this hour. But as Nora stepped inside she could see clearly. The room was large and utilitarian with a high ceiling. Tables lined the walls like cubicles. There were no windows.

353,0.6,0.9,1.0,67.0,6,42.0,"The colony's common room smelled like fresh baked bread, hot coffee, and bacon. A few colonists sat at tables, eating from plates and drinking cups. At the end of the chamber was a small kitchen where two chefs worked under the supervision of Sully Carmichael.

Sully seemed to be everywhere in this bustling place. He was constantly greeting people, issuing orders, and generally working hard to keep the facility running smoothly despite the many problems plaguing it. His wavy brown hair was graying just above the temples. The wrinkles on his face were weathered with experience. His eyes remained bright blue behind the thick lenses of his glasses.

Nora slid into a seat next to a woman named Lillian who was helping herself to seconds. ""Good morning!"" Nora said as she took a sip of her steaming cup.

""Morning,"" the other woman replied absently, putting her fork down and reaching for another bite of her meal.

Lillian was tall for a human, standing an inch over six feet. She had dark brown skin and long ebony hair tied back into a ponytail. Her deep brown eyes peered through her spectacles, which were perched on the end of her nose. They glinted with intelligence and sapphire curiosity.

The woman was a chemist named Katherine Smith. Although she worked in food preparation, her specialty was chemistry. She was also Nora's best friend among the colonists. She'd been here longer than any of the others.

Or so Nora thought until they heard the quavering voice from the kitchen. ""I'm afraid I've run out of coffee.""

Lillian jerked up guiltily. ""Oh no! We'll get you some more right away!""

Katherine shook her head as she sank into a chair. ""That won't be necessary. It was just a fluke. I didn't mean to interrupt breakfast, but I need to talk with you about something important.""

The two women exchanged glances. Nora had noticed Katherine seemed to avoid eating much lately. She'd been pensive and often morose since the colony had begun its journey into space. But this was different; there was a desperate edge to her words.

""What is it?"" Nora asked, leaning forward.

Their food forgotten, Katherine wiped her mouth with her napkin. The expression on her face was grim. She looked troubled and tired. ""It's the drones.""

Lillian gasped. Nora felt her stomach clench. She knew what the aliens were, of course, but hearing someone else say it was another matter entirely. Alien drones—those intelligent constructs that had stalked them in the darkness—were real. And they were coming for them.

The other colonists stared at their tablemates. They could feel fear emanating from the two women like an electric charge.

Nora stood up, walked over to the kitchen counter, and grabbed a piece of bread. She glanced down at her plate, which was almost empty. She hadn't eaten much lately either.

""I'll be right back,"" she told the others as she slipped out into the hallway.

She followed the passage to the end where it opened onto a small landing.

354,0.6,0.9,1.0,74.0,6,49.0,"The dormitory hallways were packed with sleeping colonists. Most of them snored softly, but the occasional quiet bleat of a distressed sleeper punctuated the air like an animal in pain.

Nora worked her way through the crowd to the communal showers at the end of the hallway, pushing open the door and stepping inside. The room was small, but it smelled fresh, thanks to the recycled water used for cleaning.

Walking back to the row of cubicles, she found a set of clothes waiting for her. She slipped on a pair of shorts and pulled on the clean shirt before grabbing her boots and slinging her jacket over one shoulder.

She emerged from the locker room into the crowded concourse. She was surprised to find that it wasn't only the colonists who had been up late. A few others lingered in their beds, too tired to get up.

Nora paused to look around. The early morning light cast long shadows across the floor and the narrow walkways. The huge, enclosed space felt like a maze. She turned a corner toward the command center, where the circular wall used the same reflective material as the ceiling. It reflected the starlight coming in through the tall windows, casting its own dim glow across the deck.

Nora shivered. Her breath fogged in front of her face. The cold air felt good on her bare feet, but she didn't relish the thought of walking through it while fully clothed. She wanted to go back for a sweater or jacket.

No time like now, she told herself, and made her way to the command center. Doors opened automatically as she approached them and closed behind her when she walked away.

The command center was a serious place. The lights were on and functional, but not bright enough to dispel the darkness. She could hear the hum of machinery as her boots clacked against metal plates underneath the feet of sleeping colonists.

When she entered the main room, it took her eyes a moment to adjust. The low overhead illumination barely lit the room, and the shadows seemed as deep as those in a cave. Nora stepped into the room, scanning the room for signs of life. She spotted the dull, metallic bulk of a desk in one corner, covered with papers and datastacks. A few chairs sat in front of the desk.

Nora relaxed. The Company execs had left long before her shift started. She wasn't expected to work this early.

She made her way through the dark rooms until she reached the armory, where she found the door open and unlocked. Inside, weapons lined the racks and hung from hooks on the walls, ready to be grabbed at a moment's notice. The wall was filled with ammunition clips for the automatic defenses.

Nora checked the loads on the pistols in her hands, and then slipped the holster onto her hip. She paused to look around the weaponry. Some of it was new, like the plasma rifles. Others were decades old.

She picked up a rifle and carried it over to the window.

355,0.6,0.9,1.0,73.0,5,46.0,"The colony's communal mess hall served as both cafeteria and recreation room. The airy complex was constructed around a central courtyard and had food storage, heating, and power generation facilities. Most colonists ate in the halls, though the dormitories also offered dining options to those without jobs.

Nora walked out into the courtyard where she found Sully already at work. He wore a similar set of clothing to her own, but his dark hair was crinkled from sleep. His brown eyes were bright with intelligence.

They bantered amicably while Nora filled up on a mug of coffee and some quick eggs. They chatted about the day ahead as they dressed and gathered their tools.

The two slipped outside the front door together, their steps echoing off the concrete walls into the quiet predawn.

""I brought you a present,"" Nora said. ""It's in the garage.""

Sully chuckled and jerked his thumb over his shoulder. ""Don't tell me-- we're going on another scavenger hunt?""

Nora grinned. ""Yeah, and this time I think we'll get a better payoff for our efforts.""

As they approached the entrance, Sully asked, ""What do you mean?""

Nora shrugged casually. ""The drones have been indiscriminate with their attacks lately. We've seen one or two of them killed, but more often than not they just fly away. So maybe there's something in the area worth hunting down. Something good enough to lure them out without getting ourselves killed.""

Sully arched a brow. ""That sounds like a pretty dangerous game. What are we looking for?""

Nora glanced around at the landscape. The craggy boulders and rugged cliffs surrounded them, but that wasn't what she meant. ""A trap. Or an ambush.""

""Ahh..."" Sully murmured. He appeared thoughtful for a moment before nodding. ""You got it. Let's go.""

Nora led him across the courtyard toward the garage. She paused when they reached the door, then looked back at Sully with a sly smile. ""And maybe a little bait?""

Sully laughed as he followed her inside. ""Just the sort of thing I'd expect from you, Nora.""

***

As soon as Sully stepped into the garage, he felt a twinge of disquiet. This was where the colony stored its most important and valuable resources-- vehicles and loaders. And right now, the place had a distinctly eerie feel.

Nora turned to look at him. ""What's wrong?""

""I don't know."" He gestured out the open doors at the looming cliffs and the dark night beyond. ""Something doesn't feel... right. I thought we were clear of drones for a while, but maybe there are some lingering around.""

""Yeah,"" Nora said. ""Well... let's get started.""

She led him past the rows of empty space where the colonists parked their vehicles, and headed deeper into the building. The garage was large enough that several distinct sections could be segregated from one another. At the far end, a wide corridor ran along the other side of the structure before opening up into a smaller room packed with equipment.

",0.12806122448979618,0.19204081632653147,0.01612244897959192
356,0.6,0.9,1.0,77.0,5,42.0,"In contrast to the haphazard layout of her room, the corridors were straight, square, and utilitarian. The walls gleamed in the dimness as Nora walked. She passed near the dormitory where she slept, but didn't stop there. Her footsteps echoed off the polished surface as she moved past the common rooms toward the cafeteria.

The cafeteria was larger than expected. Nora never ate at the cafeteria, since it was so far from her room that it took too long to walk. Instead, she went directly to the kitchen.

As usual, the kitchen was busy. A variety of colonists bustled about in a flurry of motion. They worked with purposeful efficiency, moving around heavy equipment to prepare meals for their fellow workers.

Nora joined the line of people waiting for food. She waited patiently. When her turn came, she placed her order on the tablet and received a steaming bowl of soup in return.

While Nora enjoyed the warm soup, a drone delivered a stack of four bowls of oatmeal to her table. Her meal sat untouched while she ate.

She sighed and set down her spoon. Nora finished the rest of her soup and then grabbed her utensils and headed back to the workshop. She knew better than to waste time in the cafeteria when she could be working.

Once she arrived, Nora began work with her team. The equipment she used was outdated, but it worked. It didn't take long before she had the power loaders running again.

As she worked, Nora kept an eye on the clock. After finishing the repairs, she left to shower and grab some breakfast.

She rarely ate in the cafeteria. But at least now she wouldn't have to wait until her shift started to eat.

Nora stepped out of the showers into a chilly breeze. The tiny space was crowded with people and dryers, but Nora wasn't bothered by the noise or the heat or the humidity. She walked through the crowd to the front of the building where a line snaked around the serving counter.

A drone fed each person in the line one hot meal. Nora waited for her turn. When it came, she placed her order on the tablet and received a bowl of stew in return.

As Nora ate, she watched the door. She didn't see anyone waiting to enter.

When she finished, she washed up quickly and hurried back outside.

The wind picked up, whipping her hair into Nora's eyes. The morning chill made her shiver. She ignored the cold and walked straight toward the command center.

Nora entered the command center through a reinforced door. She passed the automated defense systems and started down a wide corridor. A small butler robot stood beside an elevator.

""Can I help you?"" it asked.

Nora shook her head. ""I need to speak with Commander Valentina Kern.""

""She is not in the office today,"" the bot said. ""May I assist you in some other way?""

Nora sighed and pointed to the elevators. ""Take me there.""

357,0.7,0.4,1.0,87.0,5,43.0,"The colony's cafeteria was located next to the power plant, tucked neatly behind the main building. The clanking sound of the fusion reactor behind this structure warmed the entire area. A small group of people gathered around a long table, eating from bowls of steaming food while talking amongst themselves. Nora spotted her friends sitting together at one end of the expansive room.

Buddy, Carla, and Sully were laughing over something as they ate their morning meal. At Nora's entrance, they turned to look at her. Buddy, the youngest in the trio, grinned broadly, and Nora smiled back.

""Hey Nora!"" he said cheerfully. ""I told you about that guy we met last night. He has two heads! And then I told him you had three arms, so I bet he thought you had four.""

Carla and Sully laughed, but Nora rolled her eyes. ""You were talking about me?""

""Yeah,"" Buddy said enthusiastically. ""He'd asked if I knew the girl who could do math with her toes. You know what? I think there's somebody like that out here somewhere.""

She giggled. ""I'm sure there is.""

Sully looked up from his bowl. ""What are you doing here?""

Nora shrugged. ""I have a shift to get ready for. Besides, there's something I want to show you guys. It'll only take a minute or two to tell it to you.""

They followed her out of the cafeteria and through the colony's main building. The interior was an impressive design of metal beams, glass windows, and clear plastic walls that exposed the rock beneath them. Power conduits ran along the floors above hallways, and air ducts snaked across ceilings. Various workstations were scattered throughout the facility. Some areas mostly comprised laboratories and offices where scientists worked while others were more industrial in nature.

In one such room, Nora led the way to the wall opposite the door. She pulled open a panel hidden behind some research equipment. A small hatch slid aside and revealed a crawlspace beyond. The ladder leading down into this space smelled strongly of rust.

""Be careful!"" she cautioned. ""If you're not up to it, let me know.""

Buddy chuckled as he stepped over the lip of the hole. ""Don't worry about us. It's been a while since we've played hide-and-seek.""

Carla reached the bottom first, then turned around to help Sully. From the darkness at the end of the tunnel, a massive black orb dropped from above, glowing faintly with an eerie red light. The ball bounced once on the ground before rolling underneath the nearby equipment rack, making the whole area shudder ominously.

Sully grabbed his rifle and fired off a short burst—the loud crack of the gunfire startled Nora, who flinched away and covered her ears. When she could hear again, the black mass had moved past the equipment and was heading for the ladder through which they'd come. Buddy and Carla followed him up.

""I told you we should have brought flashlights,"" Nora said.

The trio climbed back up to find the hatch shut tight. Nora shoved a foot against it.

358,0.7,0.4,1.0,74.0,6,46.0,"The hallway was empty except for Sully, the Colony Manager. He was standing near the dormitories, observing a fat bot that worked at mopping up after the previous day's dust storms. The machine was slightly smaller than a man and moved in jerky motions like an ungainly insect.

""Morning,"" Nora called out. ""You're early today."" Her gaze drifted toward the central tower where maintenance crews were hard at work cleaning machinery on one of the secondary levels.

Sully stopped and watched her approach. No doubt he already knew why she was here despite the early hour, but they'd been close friends since Nora started working for him. They might as well get used to each other.

""And you aren't late yet either. That's good. I need your help with the upgrades next door.""

Nora frowned. Changes in the colony made everyone nervous, even though it hadn't happened often. But this time, Nora recognized the fear behind the manager's expression. He wasn't just being cautious. Something had happened last night.

""Is there a problem?""

Sully shook his head and pointed back the way they had come, then continued down the hall. ""Let's walk.""

She followed him through the center of Presley's Promise. Tall conduits ran overhead from the central power plant. Nora craned her neck and looked up in surprise at the massive steel trusses and complex webbing that supported everything above her head. Such structures were rare on planets like Presley's Promise, which boasted little natural cover beyond the cliffs and rock formations within reach of a small single-engine flyer.

It didn't stop her from falling over them while walking across the colony to get to the new engineering bay.

The new engineering bay was huge and ugly, comprised almost entirely of poured concrete slabs and enormous pipe frames. It took up an entire level between the main concourse and the auxiliary generator room. It was cold, dark, and smelled of new paint and preservatives. The only light came from electricity arcs and gas lamps on the walls.

Sully turned a corner and took Nora along another corridor, where he opened a door into one of the bays. It wasn't much better than the one she'd just left.

""A lot of work went into having this place built,"" Sully said. ""Some crews are still here, putting the final touches on it.""

Nora glanced around. She could see the outlines of machinery inside the large chamber. A pair of workers were welding a heavy brace onto the far side. Two more were hard at work on the exterior side of a control panel. Nora watched them for a moment, then looked up at the man who would be her boss.

Sully was the Colony Manager, and he was also an engineer. He wore thick, old-fashioned glasses and had short brown hair that was starting to thin. His skin was pale and his eyes were bright blue. At thirty-two years old, he didn't look like someone who'd just finished working a twelve-hour shift. In fact, Nora thought he looked tired.

359,0.7,0.4,1.0,74.0,10,48.0,"Nora passed through the common hallways, then threaded her way to the cafeteria where she grabbed a tray and filled it with a generous helping of eggs, toast, bacon, coffee, juice, and cereal. Then she went back for a second load after making sure it was empty.

When Nora reached the dormitories, she found the other colonists had already begun their morning routine. She took note of each person's schedule on the wall beside the main door. The colony was small enough that everyone knew everyone else by name. But Nora felt more comfortable if she could remember which colonists were up for each shift so she didn't end up with the wrong people facing the aliens or stuck bringing supplies to them instead of returning to the command center.

Equipment malfunctions came in different varieties: intermittent, patchy, total power loss, and software crash. All of these scenarios presented challenges and opportunities. But only Nora worked on a daily basis with the equipment directly. So she understood the cycles of when it malfunctioned. She also had experience fixing it last time.

Nora gave herself a few extra minutes to eat breakfast and walk around while her palms sweated and the world seemed to stretch out before her eyes. At least she'd get a chance to lay in some supplies for lunch. Then she skirted around the entire colony, eyeing every corner and opening. She'd never know about any of it unless she looked, and there was no reason not to be prepared.

The perimeter of the colony was heavily guarded, both physically and electronically. The outer walls bristled with weapon systems that had been developed to keep out the native wildlife. Some of the newer weapons were actually alien technology, which Nora thought was interesting considering how soon they might have to repurpose it.

Nora ended up in one of the engineering bays just off the main concourse, where she spent a short hour on power loaders and repairing some computer monitors. She wouldn't be able to work much longer once everyone else showed up for their shifts. Nora finished the repair job quickly, then went back to her dormitory, changed into her work boots, and took a few minutes transferring ammunition from a small storage locker to a set of rucksacks.

As she walked, Nora noticed the sky seemed darker than usual. It had dimmed almost immediately after first light, and now it felt like night. She speculated it was probably dust debris in the atmosphere obscuring some of the starlight, but she knew better than to assume things were going according to plan. She wasn't sure what was waiting for her down the mountain, but she trusted Sully and all the rest of them to get her through whatever came next.

She continued on and passed by the greenhouses before returning to the command center. As she approached, she heard the familiar hum of Eve's voice. Nora paused a moment, avoiding looking at Sully or anyone else within earshot.

360,0.7,0.5,1.0,73.0,6,45.0,"The hallways were deserted save for a few colonists shuffling toward their morning duties. They wore various types of uniforms, all soberly utilitarian, but each one held unique charm. Some colonists wore ill fitting jumpsuits that made them look like human-shaped sacks. Others wore bulky jackets that covered up their entire bodies except for the eyes, nose and mouth. One man wore a loose robe over a white uniform. His hair was cropped short, though Nora saw strands of it clinging to a headband sticking out from under the collar.

Nora walked down the hallway, noting that despite its long length, there weren't any doors or monsters waiting to ambush her. The halls looked empty and safe.

She smiled grimly at the thought of how far they had come.

The colonists seemed odd, yet familiar to her. Their faces were smooth and youthful, their eyes bright with health. She supposed this was because the Company maintained medical care for colonists through nanotech. And when nearby stars went nova, fresh batches of colonists arrived to replace those who died. But their genetic stock did not seem much different than that of Nora's ancestors... or the present generation.

That made her sad. It wasn't that Nora didn't appreciate being alive. Her life was full of challenges and adventure. But sometimes it felt like the future had been stolen from her people. There were so many mysteries here; why couldn't her descendants live in peace? Why did she have to fight for every scrap of food? If the Company really cared about science and advancement, why would they deny themselves such discoveries?

Nora stopped in front of the mess hall. A guard made her stop with a raised hand.

""Morning, Nora,"" he said cheerfully. He was a tall, muscular man wearing a dark gray uniform that hung off his torso.

""Hi, Tom."" She nodded at him. ""Any reports on yesterday?""

He shook his head. ""We're still working it. I've got a crew of technicians checking the systems before we can start our work, but nothing is broken yet.""

Nora frowned. ""I'd like to hear about your progress sooner.""

Tom laughed. ""If you want me to find something wrong, you're going to have to wait. We don't know what broke yet.""

Disappointed, Nora dropped her eyes and continued down the corridor. She tried not to let it show, but she knew Tom was right. The Company wasn't obliged to disclose anything; and if there were no problems reported, nobody would go out of their way to tell them.

But Nora had attended a few training sessions with the security team before being assigned here. Security reports were mandatory, though most colonists didn't expect much from the Company's guards. They weren't officers or scientists, so they couldn't add much value to research.

Nora followed the corridors toward the farm complex. This entire section was designated as off limits.

361,0.7,0.5,1.0,77.0,6,46.0,"The hallways were dim, lit only by emergency lights at intervals along the ceiling to alert the colonists when something malfunctioned. The halls smelled of dust, sweat, scuffed shoes, and old food. A few men lounged in the dark corners watching holovids.

Nora passed them without a second glance, wanting nothing more than not to get caught in the inevitable breakdown. She wanted to be home, away from these dilapidated structures where human beings struggled to keep their lives together. Home was still hours away.

A quick walk across the central courtyard brought her to the communal dining area. She paused in front of the open door as she adjusted the collar of her jacket to ward off the morning chill.

Inside, a long table filled with people, most of them eating scrambled eggs or fried potatoes or other processed foods.

Nora sat down next to an empty seat. She took a plate from the stack and piled it high with raw vegetables and protein paste.

She was too hungry to look for a place to eat alone.

Scanning the room, Nora searched for some sign of familiar faces but saw none. Her entire colony consisted of thirty-two people, including herself, and they were never apart for more than a few minutes at a time. They ate together almost every meal.

Nora stared into her bowl of paste, hardly tasting anything as she wolfed down the food. The taste lingered on her tongue even after she swallowed.

Running her fingers along the edge of her plate, she noticed her fingernails were chipped and cracked. She used to have nails like this, but they had broken off when she ran away from home. Now bare hands looked positively hideous to her.

She frowned. What was wrong with her? Why did she care what anyone else thought? It wasn't like she could do anything about it anyway.

The headache from last night's insomnia finally faded. She felt calmer, less anxious than before. Food helped settle her stomach, and Nora knew it was time to get back.

She stood up to leave but paused for a moment as someone came through the door carrying a large vat of steaming liquid in both arms. Using a sloshing metal dipper, he scooped a foamy white mound from the top and put it onto her plate. Nora glanced up at him.

He wore the same uniform as everyone else, with a print pattern over his shoulders and lapels and pockets. He said something to her. But it made no sense.

Nora shook her head and tried again, but he merely stared at her with dull eyes from behind wire-framed glasses. He nodded, though, and returned to the table with more food, leaving Nora alone.

She ate her breakfast quickly without tasting it. Her appetite was gone. Maybe she should go back into her quarters. See if she could relax there.

But she'd never been inside her own room before. And sleeping wouldn't help.

She had to see what was going on. She might not have anything better to do today, but it didn't mean she couldn't find out about the colony's problems.

362,0.7,0.5,1.0,65.0,4,45.0,"The corridor was empty save for coffee cooling in yellow receptacles. The faceless containers were set so that they resembled the shadows cast by the colonists' power plant. They absorbed heat from the reactor's exhaust, keeping them warmer than their surroundings without taking up much space.

She slipped through a side door to avoid Sully's hulking bulk. There were eight more doors along this hall, but she wanted to be first to the cafeteria. It wasn't a hardship; it was one of the reasons Nora had chosen to live here.

As she approached the cafeteria, Nora spotted the small group of people waiting outside for food. Looking closer, she saw that they weren't just waiting, they were eating. Everyone seemed to be talking at once. A few glanced over to the smaller group.

Nora raised an eyebrow and began sidling around the room. When she got close enough, she paused and looked down at the two teenagers sitting across from the others. Their conversation was strained, and she wondered if they'd heard her approaching.

""You know, I think the Jags might have been right,"" said one of the boys. He was tall with dark hair in a length that only partially covered his ears. His girlfriend sat next to him, shorter and broader than he was, with short blonde hair cut into a bob style much like Nora's. She had big green eyes that shone even brighter when she laughed.

""Yeah, according to the doc, they've taken out three of our drones so far. That makes sense."" The other boy was large, but not as tall as his friend; brown haired and freckled. ""We're just getting too damn good at this game.""

His girlfriend scoffed, shooting Nora a look. ""Jacks are the guests here. We have to show them respect.""

The taller boy snorted in disagreement. ""Respect? They want us dead. They're running tests on us, trying to find out how we do it. And you haven't seen what those things can do. It's like...you know that old movie about the alien invasion?""

""I don't care,"" his girlfriend snapped. ""If they want to play, then let 'em play. Why waste time complaining to each other?""

She turned her back on him and leaned over her tray, picking up a cup of strong black coffee.

""You sure you won't join us? You haven't eaten yet."" Nora tried to sound like she was joking, but couldn't quite pull off the act.

He shrugged. ""This is breakfast. I'm not hungry."" He looked down at his tray and picked out some fruit. A few bites later he regarded Nora with a smile. ""Besides, what can you teach me about that stuff? All your tech breaks down.""

Nora accepted the insult at face value. ""We've got a lot of smart people here.""

The blonde girl shook her head. ""The Jags are smarter than any of us. They're like gods."" She jabbed her fork into the last piece of toast on her plate, folding it up for a bite. ""They kill drones with their bare hands. They can tap into our systems without breaking a sweat.""

""Yeah, but they're not humans,"" said the tall boy. ""They never give up.

363,0.7,0.6,1.0,80.0,7,48.0,"The metallic corridors were quiet at first glance, but they rumbled and trembled with power cables. A few isolated lights glowed dimly from the ceiling indicating what rooms remained occupied. The rest of the colony was dark as well, though Nora doubted much time passed without the facility being lit up. There would be no coming back to sleep now. She had a job to do.

Legs braced, she stood upright in her boots and walked the short distance to the cafeteria. At the end of the hallway, Nora paused and glanced at the darkened room that served as the mess hall. Her stomach growled loudly enough to make her blush, so she turned around and headed for the starboard side of the command center where the kitchen was located.

Nora used the food dispenser to fill up on breakfast and protein bars, then stopped by the bathroom along the way. Avoiding the eyes of the nearby colonists, she washed her face, brushed her teeth, and changed into a fresh set of clothes.

As Nora left the bathroom, her hair was still damp, but the remainder of her outfit was dry. Time was fleeting. With a sigh of resignation, she wrapped the jacket tighter around herself and buttoned it.

Nora stepped out of the restroom and made her way through the vast maze of the colony's interior. As usual, the main concourse was filled with curious colonists who gathered in clusters and talked excitedly about their work in hushed whispers. But this morning Nora didn't look for company, or even hope for any. She needed only a single person to give her an idea of how the colonists fared.

She approached one cluster of men and women, but they were too intent on talking close enough that it was impossible to hear anything over the din of their voices. The engineers were listening intently and appeared to be deep in conversation, so Nora moved on to another group instead.

It took some time, but eventually she found him. This man stood apart from the rest of the workers and gazed up at the ceiling as if lost in thought. His white uniform fit well, indicating recent maintenance work had been done. As Nora approached, he turned his head toward her and gave a slight nod.

Nora saw to the details of her project first before turning back to the engineer. She drew closer, careful not to block his line of sight. With her hands clasped behind her back, Nora paused to study the overall layout of her assignment. The floor was a patchwork quilt of different materials laid out in a grid pattern. Each square was pieced together with metallic plates and grating to form a large pen. The pen's walls were supported by aluminum bars and decking made of corroded metal sheeting.

The concrete roof overhead was cracked and patched, and stray wires dangled down like frayed yarns. A few lights dotted the sides of the pen, but most were covered by shining dust.

364,0.7,0.6,1.0,66.0,6,50.0,"The hallway she passed through was dimly lit by the glow of a few emergency lights, but there were no other colonists around yet. She checked her wristwatch. Twenty minutes until sunrise called for quick breakfast if not for a shower.

There was a cafeteria on the other end of the dormitory wing, so Nora headed in that direction. The corridors didn't look as worn out as they probably had been, now that the colonists seemed to be staying away from them more often. Nora skirted the edges of the room, avoiding the long line waiting for food.

She found an empty table near the rear wall and sat down. She placed her tray across the chipped plastic surface with a clatter then grabbed a cup of water from the dispenser, swishing it around in her mouth to wake up before sipping at it. She removed her watch and laid it on the table next to the mug while she dug into her breakfast, half expecting it to go off in her hand.

The alarm stopped just before Nora finished eating and she left the broken bit of metal on the plate. She pulled her notebook out from under the chair as if it were a weapon, though it was really a tool for keeping track of her work.

Nora got up and walked over to a row of overhead power outlets. She checked for a cable leading back to her quarters, anywhere that could deliver electricity without wires. A few of the cables looked worn, but none of them had been cut. The outlet would have to do.

Her thinking wasn't as crisp this early in the morning, but there was no time to waste. Running into a problem like waking up to an emergency wouldn't wait until later to be dealt with when she might need her wits about her. Nora slid the cable out of its slot in the wall and plugged it into one of the outlets. After a moment, the light above the outlet came on and she began to pat the walls looking for another way to an electrical socket.

""You're up.""

Nora turned to find Valentina standing behind her with a grin. ""Hey. I didn't realize you were awake already.""

It took a second for Nora's mind to catch up with her eyes, because she hadn't seen the commander make her appearance. She straightened, putting her notebook away.

Valentina leaned over to a nearby table and picked up a mug before handing it to Nora. She grinned again. ""I see you finished breakfast. Good for you.""

Nora accepted the mug gratefully. It was warm, but not hot enough to scald her fingers. The cup must've come from the dispenser, then. ""Thanks,"" Nora said.

""No thanks necessary. You're always hungry. Don't worry about getting your face dirty doing onsite work, though. We'll be taking a break soon.""

They headed down the hallway in silence for a few steps before Valentina spoke again.

""And don't go scaring off any other colonists, either.

365,0.7,0.6,1.0,83.0,5,47.0,"The colonists'halls were long rows of small rooms containing three beds and a workbench where each person kept their possessions. The halls swarmed with the aroma of cooking food. A few people sat around the room at tables, eating, talking to friends, or just reading. It was always early morning for the colony, and everyone was still asleep.

Nora knew she should be grateful for this quiet time, but as usual, the solitude made her restless.

She went to grab several fruits from a basket on one table before heading for the communal kitchen. As she worked her way through the crowds, other colonists waved greetings.

""Good morning,"" Nora greeted them as she passed. ""I'm headed to work.""

A few nodded. Nora tried not to make eye contact with anyone. She was too busy to do so anyway.

At the end of the hall, Nora spotted her friend Paul, sitting on his bed and scrolling through a book while complaining about the colony's cold weather.

""Hey, Nora!"" he called out. He closed the book and stood when he saw her. ""You're up? How is it?""

Nora shrugged. She couldn't think of anything good to say, but Paul didn't seem to notice. He seemed more concerned with making sure she ate breakfast than anything else.

""Cold."" Nora shivered. ""We're above the surface. Can't see your breath, though, even if you do lay on the floor. Good thing I'm going to work early. You want something to eat?""

Paul grinned. ""Yeah, thanks. The guys are still eating breakfast but I can wait.""

Nora waved to him and smiled. ""Good luck.""

For a few minutes, Nora continued to make her way down the corridor. She took several turns, looking for the right door, then slipped into the small room.

She pulled back the curtain and saw a long counter of equipment, tools, and cleaning supplies. She grabbed some gloves from one bin. Paul had been right; the workers were just pulling muffins together at another counter. The crew also liked coffee and tea, so Nora picked up a thermos along with a package of filters.

A large window looked outside over the settlement's fields, but it was covered with sheets now. No matter what time of day, the colonists always kept everything from blowing away during storms. After this first trip across the sky, they had developed quite a system.

The workers laughed while Nora filled her pockets with food. She did not have to check imps to know how much she would need for the next few hours.

Nora returned to the streamers. When dawn broke, she was already working on her second batch of cables. She had to reroute a dozen circuits to move communications traffic around the colony. If she didn't finish soon, the morning shift would leave without her.

She set down utensils and wiped her sticky hands on the sleeves of her jacket. Another group of workers began winding up their work, but Nora ignored them.

366,0.7,0.7,1.0,69.0,8,36.0,"The colonists' prefab buildings were communal structures constructed in silvery tubes along intersecting paths, like metallic plumbing with rectangular apartments lining the sides. The layout was fluid, flexible, and efficient. The colony's well-used walkways had been enlarged to accommodate more people with wider sidewalks, and the number of pathways had increased. Buildings rose up around Nora as she strode across the concourse toward the cafeteria. Their generous windows reflected the morning sun, casting flickering shadows across her path.

She came to a stairwell and ascended to the fourth level where her lab was located. A heavy door led to the laboratory, but her security access code opened it with ease. Nora stepped inside the large room and logged into her computer terminal set next to her workbench.

A few technicians sat at their terminals analyzing data and monitoring instruments. Many others worked on various projects, examining disassembled machines and jotting down notes in notebooks. Nora scanned the crew for her fellow engineers until she found one she recognized.

""Hey, Nora,"" Jack said cheerfully. ""I get off late today."" He pushed back his dark hair and wiggled his eyebrows. His tanned face was open, friendly, intelligent, and kind. He spoke with a strong accent and an infectious grin. Although he wore an engineer's uniform, Nora felt comfortable around him. They'd spent many evenings together working, joking, and drinking coffee. Jack might have been the only person who could understand her odd sense of humor.

Nora grunted. ""You've got extra time, right?""

He nodded. ""My replacement just arrived. I'm going to grab some breakfast and head out.""

""Take care, okay? I'm short-handed today.""

Jack waved goodbye.

Nora turned her attention to the console, which displayed a list of maintenance tasks requiring her immediate attention. She typed in team assignments, staring at the screen, then rose and walked over to the workbench. A small robot rolled along beside her, propelled by thin cables connecting it to the ceiling. Nora retrieved various tools from storage, including a screwdriver. The soft whine of its servo motors filled the laboratory while she fiddled with the machine's numerous screws.

Nora returned the screwdriver and picked up a hammer before walking back to the robot. With a few deft taps, she loosened one of the electronic modules on the robot's underside. Snapping it free, she dropped the module into an open pouch attached to her belt. At the same time, she plugged a cable into the computer, removed a connector plug from another device, and inserted it into her belt.

The robot rolled out and Nora followed after, leaving the lab behind.

At first glance, her assigned path seemed to lead directly toward the cafeteria. But the way was actually deceptive. She turned off several intersecting pathways and found herself on a familiar trail.

367,0.7,0.7,1.0,77.0,5,45.0,"The hallways were empty except for one other human, an elderly man with a thick beard that bristled like a porcupine's quills. He sat at the end of the hallway in front of the communal bathroom and stared vacantly into space. His eyes were dull and watery, but he seemed content to sit there unmoving.

Nora sighed as she passed him, wondering if the meatheads who kept this place running had been assembled here from the same gene pool as her employer. Whatever the case, they still looked out of their element. She couldn't blame them.

The central hall of the colony was dirtier than she'd expected. At least it wasn't coated in grime, though. A day of hard work had left her sweaty and covered in dust in more ways than one. Nora ran a hand through her hair, then wiped the back of the glove on her pants to get rid of the grit embedded there.

As she hurried toward the cafeteria, the temperature dropped noticeably. The air struggled for breath around her in ragged gulps that tugged at her skin, making her shiver despite herself. She hated the cold. It made her eyes water and sent tiny needles of pain coursing up her arms and spine. Still, she wasn't about to back down.

By now, she knew the drill as well as anyone else in this building. They wouldn't be getting any breaks today. ""See you later, guys.""

She entered the cafeteria, which was decorated with a few rows of tables that were already filled with hungry colonists. Most of them took their breakfast off to one side where the servers quickly scanned the plates before passing them along. A few others came in too late for lunch, but hefted trays of food from the kitchen just in time for dinner.

Nora found a free table and sat with her tray in hand. She hadn't even taken her jacket off yet.

It didn't matter. Everyone in the cafeteria was dressed in the same manner—with the exception of a couple stubborn ladies who insisted on wearing long, heavy coats despite the heat. Nora didn't know how they stood it. She'd been tempted to complain about the cold herself, until she realized that would mean she had to give up her outer layer of clothing.

She waited for the server to come by and whisk away her empty plate. Then Nora rose and turned toward the kitchen, folding up her utility coat and putting it under her seat. She hauled out a chair and moved to sit down as the server passed, but he simply reached over his shoulder and started propelling the chair toward her.

""Hey,"" she said. ""That's my—""

He began pushing the folded-up chair right back at her again.

Nora gaped. ""I'm not done!""

The server blinked and held out an arm, motioning for her to calm down. He frowned. ""Are you deaf?""

""No! No, I just—""

He winced suddenly, then shuddered. The server let go of the chair and fled. Nora stared after him, baffled.

368,0.7,0.7,1.0,87.0,6,43.0,"The Colony's central power plant wasn't far from the dormitories. The massive, several story building's towering metal fins reflected the dull red glow of a distant star. A thick haze hung over the metallic complex, obscuring fine details as it shifted in the wind.

Leaving the shelter of her room behind, Nora stopped to look around. Despite its name, the power plant felt like any other industrial facility. The broad, smooth concrete floor was littered with debris from recycling lines and giant drills. Rows of machinery lined the walls. Hoisting frames held immense chains for hoists that could lift wads of trash high enough to be whisked away.

The place hummed with activity. Workers in heavy coveralls, gloves, boots, and helmets tended the equipment scattered across the floor. Or they worked on repairing it. There were repair bays where men and women in white coats and masks stood at workstations, inspecting the equipment, adjusting settings, or tinkering with parts. They tested connections and adjusted circuit boards. And they did a good job of keeping the colony running. Even though most of their tools broke down every few minutes.

Nora walked through the construction zone in an opposite direction from the main entrance. She glanced left as she passed the corner of one large machine, hoping to see an engineer hauling a scrap metal part back to the reconstruction bay, but only found a grimy drop cloth and some stacked gear.

She turned right just as her path took her past another line of workers, and slipped into the service corridor that connected the power plant to the dormitories. A row of doors punctuated the walls, each marked with a small glowing tube that indicated it was occupied. The dim light of the tubes cast sputtering shadows on the white wall.

Nora reached for the door handle, but hesitated before squeezing her hand around it because it might be sore tomorrow. But that's what she got for sleeping in. If it wasn't for all the nagging aches, she wouldn't have left her bed today. Nora sighed again. It was her fault for overworking herself.

But while the others complained and groused about how hard their shifts were, Nora actually looked forward to hers. It made her feel useful. And she'd only had to do it three more times since arriving here. Her next shift didn't start until after lunch.

Nora gripped the cool knob of the service entrance, then paused as a cold draft brushed against her bare arm. She shivered. Scraping noises came from the other side of the door, followed by muffled voices and a flurry of footsteps.

A man with sandy hair hurried through the doorway in front of her. He wore a white coat over an orange coverall. His face was grimy, his eyes bloodshot. With one hand, he held the door for two women wearing work clothes behind him. They ran down the hallway pushing carts full of industrial tools that rattled and clanked.

Nora's breath caught when she saw who it was. ""Will?""

369,0.7,0.8,1.0,83.0,5,45.0,"The utilitarian corridors were lit by unshielded lights built into the walls. She passed rows of colonists as she walked to the cafeteria. Many of them were already awake, quietly moving about their business. The place was crowded at this early hour. They stared when they saw her, but few spoke.

For as long as Nora could remember, she'd been aware of another world above. And every day since arriving on the planet, she'd wondered what it was like.

She paused for a moment in front of Sully's office to look up at the high window. No one else was there yet, so she unlocked the door and stepped inside.

Sully sat behind his desk. He looked tired, but he smiled brightly as Nora entered. ""Good morning, Nora.""

Nora nodded in response as she took the chair across from him. She didn't know how to answer back. How do you greet someone who has murdered your family? How does one express gratitude for saving a life after fleeing an imminent death?

""You're here bright and early,"" Sully said. ""I'm glad you're on time today. I want to talk about the report you wrote yesterday. I read it last night. It was very thorough, Nora. But I think we should take another step beyond observation. You should try to understand why things are the way they are.""

It wasn't the words, but his tone as he spoke them that got Nora's attention. The man she knew was nothing like this—cold, logical, and sometimes distant. When Sully talked, it felt like he had some idea of what he wanted to say without having to be coaxed into talking about it first.

""What kind of step?"" Nora asked.

Sully leaned forward, resting on his elbows. His expression was serious and focused. ""We have a problem above us.""

Nora swallowed hard. ""They're the ones who killed my mother and father, Sully."" She paused to consider her words carefully. ""And they could kill me right now if they wanted to.""

""That's not what I mean,"" he said gently. ""I'm talking about the company rules. We can't just sit here. They expect us to do something about it.""

Nora took a deep breath, feeling her chest constrict with nerves. The Company already knew the drones were on the planet, and they'd been watching. There was no point in hiding it from them. Even better, the Company expected her to find out why the aliens attacked.

And we'll need every bit of data about the hive up there to make that happen.

""You're worried about your family's death."" Sully sat forward again, leaning toward her. ""I can't take their deaths lightly, but neither should you. The existence of the drone nests is bad enough. If the Company doesn't back us with resources and manpower, we'll lose the colony. But losing your life isn't an option either. You understand?""

Nora nodded slowly. Outside the window, daylight brightened across the landscape. ""So... the only way to stop the drones from hunting me down is to save my parents?

370,0.7,0.8,1.0,90.0,5,48.0,"At the end of the hall, she stared at the lift doors. They were black, like everything else about this place. The lights never stayed on in the dormitories, and the dark corridors made alertness difficult even for colonists used to living underground. But once her eyes adapted to the gloom, Nora found a dimly glowing strip along each wall that lit the way when the door opened. She felt safer now.

She sighed as the clanging of the doors echoed through the halls. The smooth, gleaming surfaces reflected every sound back in eerie echoes.

The colony had been set up to be self-sufficient for as long as possible while the Company sent in supplies. For the past few years, however, the colony's equipment had begun failing more frequently, even though it hadn't yet reached the point where they could no longer supply their own needs.

Nora passed strange machines and devices sticking out from the walls, many of them quite large and complex. She saw a thick bank of monitors next to a workbench that was covered with tools. More screens projected from the ceiling, monitoring the status of equipment and systems throughout the colony. The space above the main concourse bustled with people working, but the lower floor remained quiet.

A short man came toward her down one of the dim corridors, making little noise on the bare metal floor. He seemed to glide like some kind of ghost in his grey jacket and dark trousers. His head was shaved bald, and he wore a light brown wig over his scalp. There was something odd about him—an air of menace that made Nora shiver despite the heat in the corridor.

""Good morning, Dr. Decker,"" said the newcomer cheerfully enough. ""How are you feeling this fine day?""

The man stopped beside a workbench in front of her, his face wreathed with an expectant smile.

""James, please. I'm not—""

His expression darkened slightly.

""I know. The name is James. It's my job to remind you.""

Nora frowned. No, it wasn't just that. Something in the way he smiled at her made her uneasy.

""I don't want to be reminded. And I'm not interested in getting help, thank you very much. Now get out of here so I can finish my work!""

He stepped back and disappeared into the shadows. A moment later, there was a sharp click, and then a section of the ceiling slid open with practiced ease, revealing another corridor beneath. The door closed back down again, and Nora turned to find an identical device on the other side of her.

She shook her head wearily. Was this a colonist joke? Or maybe...

Nora switched off the sound in her ears, giving herself time to figure it out. She growled, irritated.

""Okay, okay! Why is everybody trying to make me paranoid?""

371,0.7,0.8,1.0,78.0,8,49.0,"The narrow hallways were dark, cold, and quiet as the colony slept. A couple steps in each direction brought Nora to a pair of doors at opposite ends of the corridor. At the far end of the row was her dormitory, darkened and still.

At the other side of the hallway stood the living quarters for the minor executives in the colony. Their rooms had electric lights, soft carpeting, and heavy furniture. The hum of machinery rose from behind some walls, but not so much that it drowned out the snores. In fact, the noise sounded remarkably normal.

The executive residential wing was a world away from Nora's modest, sparsely furnished room in the dormitories. It seemed like they were expecting colonists to live like royalty on Presley's Promise, even though most of the company representatives lived off planet in their corporate offices.

Nora passed a few more empty dorms on her way out of the building, and stopped when she reached the last door at the end of the long hall. The heavy security door split the wall in two, and a small window let in a dim glow. She examined the lock for a moment before sliding open the door.

The master bedroom was large enough for four people to sleep simultaneously. However, only one bed was made up. Aside from a ragged sleeping bag, an empty backpack, and clothes piled neatly at the foot of the bed, there wasn't anything else in the room.

'Truer words,' Nora muttered under her breath, shaking her head.

She left the room and walked back down the hallway toward the kitchen.

The communal bathrooms were designed to be shared by several people at once, so that everyone could take a shower or use the toilets without waiting in line. The corridor was dark except for the faint light filtering through the frosted glass doors of half a dozen bathrooms lined up along one side.

Nora passed the first bathroom and stepped into a dimly lit space where the hot water heater hissed to life, sending steam rising from its twin vents. A couple of colonists lounged in the far corner with their feet propped on a table while another man sat alone at the counter, idly stirring something in a saucepan set over a makeshift stove.

Nora shivered out of her jacket and hung it on a hook behind the door, but kept the utility pants and boots on. She stripped off her shirt and tossed it in a pile with the others, then pulled a towel from a stack nearby and rubbed herself down.

Nora avoided looking too closely at the other colonists, whose faces she saw only briefly as they glanced up to acknowledge her gaze. She didn't know them well enough to put names to their faces; however, she had seen them around the colony before and recognized some as engineers. They didn't seem to look quite right. Something was wrong, but she wasn't sure what. It just bothered her...

The heat felt good after the chilly corridor so Nora let her hair hang free. The towel made her feel confident in her bare skin, which gave her confidence that she could handle whatever problems came her way today, as long as she had the tools necessary to get the job done.

372,0.7,0.9,1.0,82.0,6,45.0,"The dormitory hallways were dimly lit by a handful of flickering lights on poles and globes overhead, while the walls themselves—plated in dark gray plates—were closer to black. The carpet was worn in places where it had been worn through during use over many years, but the pods and cubicles lining the halls were orderly, neat, and clearly used.

The colonists'quarters weren't overly luxurious; they simply looked functional and efficient. But she was grateful for such things. She couldn't afford luxuries like this on her salary, not if she wanted to get by. Not after her mother's death.

Nora slipped around the corner to the communal showers, thankful the first batch of colonists hadn't gotten here yet. She didn't relish having to share a shower with strangers who might or might not be friendly. She needed privacy, even if that meant waiting longer in line.

As Nora passed one of the stalls, a pair of eyes glowed orange in the open doorway. A lean man stood there in an undershirt and pants. He peered out at her, his gaze intense and piercing.

Nora paused.

The man started forward, his head cocked to the side. His mouth opened.

A woman's voice rang from inside the stall, startling Nora, and the door slammed shut.

Nora spun away, fearing a trap, but the other commotion caught her attention instead. A group of workers had arrived with crates and bags in tow. They had stopwatches and clipboards for marking progress.

She stepped into the shower room, grateful to be alone again. She didn't want to deal with the huddled crowd of people and their curious stares right now. She just wanted breakfast. And a chance to catch up on some sleep.

The hot water sluiced over her body, making her shiver. She reached out to the control panel by the showerhead, turning off the flow. Steam clouded the air around her. The glowing lights overhead flickered across the walls like dying embers.

Nora washed herself quickly, not waiting for full heat. When she was finished, she exited the stall and locked the door behind her.

With a sigh, Nora pulled on sweatpants instead of underwear before donning her jacket and slipping a pair of thick socks over her boots. After brushing her teeth, she returned to her quarters and grabbed her backpack.

The kitchen would have fresh food, breakfast. She hoped. Nora pushed through the door with her head down and shoulders hunched to avoid catching anyone's eye, but in spite of her best efforts her shoulders were still pointed when she emerged into the hall.

A handful of colonists dressed for work had already gathered at the front of the cafeteria. Nora tried not to look too eager, although the sight of so many people clustered around the breakfast table made her hungry enough to risk looking.

But the rest of the colony had to fend for itself until a supply ship came again. Nora was glad she hadn't slept in her clothes, because there wasn't time now, not even in the quiet of early morning.

Nora's boots thudded on the hard tiles every step of the way as she marched through corridors to the communal kitchen. She was starved. The food would be stale and cold, but it beat being hungry for the remainder of her shift.

The corridors filled with other colonists emerging from their rooms. They stopped to offer brief greetings or just wave off as Nora passed. No one spoke more than necessary, consuming precious time just to get breakfast.

Nora was famished. She wanted bacon. A big mug of black coffee. And something sweet. Anything but what she got.

She made it through the communal dining hall and into the mess hall without incident. Nora had to force herself to keep her steps short and deliberate. To slow down would cause a stampede here, where the only sound was the clatter of utensils on steel trays.

But the table she headed for proved too full, so Nora took a seat at another—one more populated than most—and forced herself to wait. She didn't know what to do next.

Penny must have been busy while they were sleeping. Another hot meal waited for them—if anyone could manage to cook or warm food after two days on the colony, it would be Penny. But that meant finding someone to take her place in line.

Nora had no idea who would volunteer. There wasn't time to panic over a few missed meals. She was too focused on survival to worry about anything else. Nora wasn't going to let any godforsaken aliens steal away the last thing she'd left behind.

She sat with her back straight and eyes fixed forward, the quiet of the mess hall broken only by snatches of conversation and occasional coughing. Nora kept her head down until it was her turn to pick up a tray, holding the metal plate as far from the edge as possible to avoid hitting the adjacent person.

The noise startled her. Had she been sitting there too long? She looked up, scanning the room for threats. No one had noticed her.

She set the plate on the table in front of her and held out a hand. ""Sorry,"" she said quietly, not wanting to draw attention. A few people turned their heads at her words, but nothing more.

When everyone had spoken their piece, Nora found herself alone again with her meal. She was still hungry, but her stomach felt strangely hollow.

Nora glanced at the plate. Her bacon was pale pink and crispy.

374,0.7,0.9,1.0,75.0,6,45.0,"The hallway was empty save for a few colonists who were already up and working. They greeted her with nods and friendly waves, but none lingered in conversation. Everyone knew why they were here.

Nora had been at the colony only two weeks, when she learned to live with the sight of her parents' bodies lying in their home's hallway like discarded fish skeletons. The colonists felt similarly about the main concourse, which Nora skipped to reach the kitchen.

It was the only place of any comfort here. It wasn't large, just big enough for three workers to line up at the counter. Here they could eat together in a group that comprised more than fifty people.

The long tables were empty except for one man and woman, who sat at the end of the row away from Nora. She ignored them as she retrieved her favorite breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, and brewed coffee, then filled a plate with food and took it to the counter.

Nora crowded through the remaining colonists, who paused in their conversations and stared attentively in her direction. Their eyes were glazed over with hunger. She did not blame them. Lately she'd been too tired to cook anything more interesting than cereal and toast for herself, let alone the other guests. Her parents had always made sure to have fresh fruit on hand, but those days were gone now.

""Hey!"" said a chipper voice behind her. ""Table four left.""

Nora turned to see an older man dressed in thick clothes covered with flannel patches. His tan face was lined deeply around his eyes and he sported a full beard, which was neatly trimmed and combed. He waved at the table beside him.

She was going to leave the eggs and bacon for last, but hurriedly grabbed the plates, spilling some of each onto the floor. At her speed, she wouldn't be able to catch them before they hit the floor.

""Sorry,"" Nora muttered as she picked up the plates and dropped her own food into a plastic container. She added thick slices of bread, some butter, and leftover bacon strips to carry everything else in one armful. ""And sorry again, I really am.""

Nora jogged down the hall and back to her quarters, trying to avoid the kitchen cleanup crew. It wasn't until she stepped inside that she realized she may have accidentally spilled coffee on them too.

The faint scent crept through her nostrils, reminding her what she'd nearly forgotten. Nora stood for a moment in the dormitory's tiny common room, taking deep breaths of filtered air so full it made her head swim. Her body felt heavy and sluggish from lack of sleep.

Nora set the containers down on the table and collapsed onto her bed. She stared at the ceiling for a few minutes, focusing on the threads of light trapped in its cracks. After a few moments, she felt calm enough to consider the day ahead.

Six hours lay between her and when she would begin work. For the next two hours, it didn't matter how tired or hungry she was. She had to eat. Otherwise, she wouldn't be strong enough to do what needed doing.

Nora sat up and focused on the food.

375,0.8,0.4,1.0,82.0,6,41.0,"The familiar hallway stretched into darkness and gloom beyond the dim glow of hall lights. Thick shadows pooled in places where the walls met the ceiling, blocking the far end of the long passage. Just like any other sector on the colony, this one had only a few rooms for meals, recreation, sleeping quarters. Most colonists slept wherever they could.

Everyone needed rest, especially after working so hard.

The main corridor ended at the cafeteria's entrance. A tall glass window filled much of the wall above every door leading off the concourse. The colored glass reflected distorted silhouettes of the colonists, giving the room a hauntingly empty aspect even when people were present.

Nora slipped through the glass doors, stepping toward the row of free breakfast trays. She selected an egg sandwich from the formica covered tray and placed her order with a constant machine voice. Halfway through placing the food items, a menu appeared in a translucent overlay over Nora's vision. With a groan, she picked up her own plate.

The egg sandwich was warm. Toasted bread and fluffy scrambled eggs made for a satisfying combination. It tasted like a real meal, despite its synthetic origin. After shoveling the contents into her mouth, Nora washed it down with two big gulps of cold water. Her meal came in a square container no bigger than a pocket book. One bite and she had to stifle another yawn.

She stepped back inside the darkened hallway once more. Stairs led upward, but on the way back to her quarters she passed the cafeteria again. Nora headed for a different plant instead. The handler growled something as Nora pushed past her, then turned away coldly without a word.

Nora didn't turn around to see what the matter was. A moment later she found herself at the edge of a bonfire. Lithe figures danced along the fire's dangerous perimeter. Shadows shrouded the dancers in a rippling weave of dark and light. Some of them were naked. Nora couldn't help staring.

A hand clutched her shoulder, spinning her around. Nora gasped as she saw the man who'd grabbed her was nearly twice her size. His skin was rough and scarred. Teeth obscured his face, which was coarse with muscle and pronounced scars from old wounds. He wore a plaid shirt with frayed cuffs over a pair of battered jeans.

The man drew himself up, towering over her despite their close height difference. Sullen anger burned in him like white-hot coals beneath a blanket. Nora's mouth worked silently. Whatever she wanted to say, it must have been inaudible to him.

""There are rules here,"" the man said. ""This is my sector so you don't go messing shit up.""

He released her, but not because Nora had spoken or even moved. She just stood there, dazed and terrified. Haltingly, Nora mumbled an apology.

376,0.8,0.4,1.0,68.0,7,44.0,"The colony welcomed its new residents as they slipped out of their cots. The others were up, making progress toward a meal. Everyone wore their best clothes for the occasion; some even went so far as to put on makeup.

In contrast, Nora's face bore only the barest hint of cosmetics. Her cropped blonde hair was dull but still held in place at the top, while her eyes looked large and dark blue under the stark white foundation. She kept her eyes modestly averted from the few men whom she passed. Most women still retained a lot of their youth and beauty after childhood, when company was scarce. But Nora's kind had always been made of sterner stuff. Barely free of childbearing hips, Nora walked without lingering glances over any shoulder.

The crew assembled into two groups of some dozen to escort each other to breakfast. At the head of one group, Lt. Leslie Hunter marched in step with Defense Techs Alex and Michal. An older gentleman followed behind them, a biodigital assistant who worked late overseeing critical systems and managing supplies.

Behind him, Company security and tactical personnel gathered into pairs. They trailed after. Others trailed the group of traditionalists leading the procession — members of the community council, shopkeepers and front line bureaucrats. Some of these people had already taken time for a leisurely morning cup of coffee with neighbors, or to make afternoon deliveries.

Nora joined this second group, casually jogging with the others toward the dining hall. She longed to chat, but the colonel needed her to help look for the malfunctions. If she didn't move quickly, it would be impossible to get anything accomplished today.

""Hey."" Nora used a handlight from her belt as extra illumination. ""How are you doing?"" Commander Kern asked, pulling ahead to talk while moving at a brisk pace.

""I'm fine,"" Nora answered. The woman rushed back after a few steps to walk beside her, making conversation with a quickness that seemed unnatural in her age and responsibility.

Kern kept up a pleasant if brisk tone of voice. ""You've been working on the hubble lately? That's not too bad, is it? We're hopeful we'll be able to use electronics again soon. The damage isn't structural, but the repairs take longer than the initial construction. Anyway, I'd love to hear what you've got planned for after your shift.""

Nora nodded, trying to stop herself from running to keep up. ""This new repair project, almost every part of the old one, and the new sensors... All drawing power from the same conduit.""

""That's right. My shift this morning was uneventful."" Kern fell silent for a moment, then spoke absently, musing over something else. ""Or so I thought. A drone came out of nowhere, shot a hole in an airlock, and then vanished. Just like that..."" Her lips pursed uncertainly as she considered some unseen problem.

""We all saw it happen,"" Nora said automatically.

377,0.8,0.4,1.0,67.0,11,42.0,"After a quick toilet break outside in the hall, Nora entered the main hallway where the dim orange glow cast eerie shadows around the corners. She passed the mess hall – one could only assume it was named after such things when meals were barely edible - where colonists filed through little portholes for communal plates of greens and steaks with smaller hunks of what she assumed might be cheese, and hard buns toasted in a pan. The smell made her realize that while the food wasn't bad, it was probably not healthy either. A few people gave her curious glances but none approached Nora. She didn't blame them; the scraggly blonde woman smelled amazing.

In contrast to the stark bleakness of the dormitory halls, this part of the complex exuded warmth and promise. Pastel green walls showcased plantings large enough to provide rainwater, park benches stood at intervals along pathways, clear doors led off hallways, and light filtered through windows into framed pictures hung on the walls. It was like a public park rather than an industrial outpost.

Nora continued towards the admin offices, the first open area she would encounter during her rotation. She paused briefly to catch her breath as the smells of composting plants and nearby waste processors competed with exhaust from powerloaders working by the side walls. Several of those generators were idling, pumping out their powerful hums, as maintenance workers scrambled along worn, yellow floor tiles alongside larger equipment. The rest of the path was empty between steps so Nora climbed over a rusted vat housing parboiling chemicals and stepped up to scrub in with the other technicians.

She knelt beside another employee who was cleaning machinery by hand, working to untangle a mess of wires and tubing with a pair of pliers. With skillful efficiency she wrenched the tubes free and tossed them into a bucket, where they hissed in protest as moisture evaporated. She brushed greasy hair back from her face and smiled warmly at the woman before rising to move on to the next machine.

They all knew each other well; most of these people had been here for years, and there was no fear of stepping onto a work surface that hadn't seen use in months. Their daily routine worked off a cycle based around shifts, their sleep schedules, and meals. They rarely talked much, but Nora had to admit that even though she never saw the same faces twice in three months, it still felt like home.

Nora climbed the stairs, the metal treads creaking underfoot as she reached the top. As required by Company rules, Nora's quarters consisted of a small room with a bunk bed and bathroom attached, but security cameras were everywhere else on the complex, so it wasn't uncommon to see one or two others using the upper access hallways for private purposes instead.

A thick doorfront marked the way into the next segment, and Nora adjusted her jacket to make sure all the buttons remained tight without being too constricting over her utility pants.

378,0.8,0.5,1.0,66.0,6,43.0,"On the other side of the dormitories, Sully stood at the entrance to the dining hall chatting up a few female colonists he worked with when Nora arrived. He grinned at her as she passed, asking if there was anything he could do for her.

""Oh, my day's just getting started."" She rolled her eyes. ""I need to get to the power plant though. Might be a good time to pick your brains about how everything works around here, I suppose.""

Sully nodded. ""Good point. I'll see you after lunch. You can tell me then. Want to eat first?""

Nora stopped in the threshold of her dormitory doorway. ""That depends what I'll have time for.""

She walked out of the building and headed along the main thoroughfare toward the engineering bay by the power plant. Her boots clacked on the surface of the plascrete, which roasted her bare feet with each step.

The metal doors of the entrance were ten meters tall and there wasn't room to go around it. It was two layers thick and filled with a baffle grid. The ground beyond the door had soft texture reminiscent of fine sponge, not hard concrete. Nora suppressed a chuckle at the thought of patrolling foot soldiers sliding on their bellies in these doors, because everyone knew the aliens would sense the sponginess.

Everything was designed that way. Much of the colony's equipment didn't work here. And even when it did, it broke down within a couple hours if used often enough. There was no point in wasting energy or supplies. But the corridors and paths weren't so bad. They simply couldn't fit the technology available here into regular buildings.

At least Sully said the high-tech stuff worked better here than anywhere else in the colonies. No use complaining about it now.

Resting her hand on warm panels, she pushed through seeking shadows cast by the distant sun. More people pounded past her from both directions, surrounded her by the tantalizing tang of water hydrants, and the unique air pressure seeped inside her boots. She drew a deep breath inside the thick jacket, enjoying the sharp scent of ozone coming off the walls around her.

Hot water vapor condensed above the plascrete floor, popped and hissed in tiny waves. ""That's odd,"" Nora murmured aloud. She stepped where it was mushy and sank down to sit.

The dampness gently cushioned her bare backside as she leaned forward toward a panel set into the wall. The control gave an unnatural click. A sensor on the panel flashed green several times before Nora saw the flow of fluid instead of light.

379,0.8,0.5,1.0,63.0,5,44.0,"She met Sully in the commons. The room buzzed with well-built men and women moving purposefully about their jobs. Nora joined the line at the feeding station, grabbing a box lunch. When she reached the front of the line, she took off her jacket to reveal an uniform beneath.

Unlike many of the colonists, Nora wore the sleek black tunic and trousers of the company's mechanics as opposed to the practical work clothes used by others among the colony. She'd been assigned here after basic training because of her skill with tech, so she felt comfortable in the tailored uniforms reserved for those who worked with advanced equipment--even if they had to wear them outside of their own quarters.

Sorry, Sully called out as Nora approached him, but I made sure Oracle was prepped and ready, he said, pointing towards another mechanic. Is everything okay?

Everything is fine, there was no need to worry. He gave her a quick once over while she bent to place her order. Are you sure? This could be an emergency.

It wasn't, I'm just hungry. How long have I been away?

Since last night. Almost twenty hours. Do you know what happened? Nora returned to the table where her tray waited.

Yeah. The drones showed up, they got a few of our people. We lost people too. My brother...

Iris dropped out of her report as she heard the news. You're not kidding.

Sully nodded and tried to smile at Nora. Well, I guess my shift ends soon. You don't mind if I eat this now instead of waiting until morning?

No, that's fine, but still, please tell the others. They'll be glad to know.

I will, promise. Before Sully left, he paused and leaned in close with a meaningful look. You might want to do some digging. There's a rumour going around, something about someone heading for the sky. Something bad. Maybe it'll help keep spirits up.

Nora raised an eyebrow and dipped her head toward him. Thanks. He slipped out through the door before she had time to think about his warning more than necessary.

With the watch committee meeting over, Iris returned to her station as Nora prepared to make her way back to her quarters. That day's schedule didn't include any scheduled meetings, but the colonists rarely left their duties early anyway. She only glanced up when Nora approached her. Hello, Nora.

Iris nodded politely and turned towards the terminal on her desk. Did you hear anything from your brother? I leave a message every couple hours hoping.

Nora pushed forward until she stood right beside Iris. You really should talk to the company. They have some weird machine that can detect anomalies and stuff like this. Why don't they send it? I'm sure if we just ask nicely, it'll show up later.

380,0.8,0.5,1.0,77.0,9,45.0,"The colonist dormitory emptied rapidly as colonists rose to start their day in never-ending shifts to keep up production levels. With its glass walls, each room held the sound of voices filtering from the hallways outside. In the background, the murmur and clank of automated machinery rolled through the empty chambers.

Nora walked along the echoing corridor to where she stored her power loaders and boots, further jolting herself awake. They were good for long days, but only within a limited range if they worked at all. As far as Nora knew, they still ran better than the colony's energy generator.

The boot locker was on one side of the large hallway, but she could walk directly to it without barging into any other doors. The ones in front of her creaked open with a soft pneumatic hiss, dissolving the silence of step after step until the room was filled with people.

Nora paused about halfway along the first row of lockers, looking around. The rest of the room was dimly lit by a narrow beam that stretched over most of the ceiling. A few colored bulbs illuminated rows of spaces, casting elongated shadowed shapes on the racks of neatly folded jackets, shirts, pants, shoes, belts, and other tools. Other hanging garments had been taken down to dry since morning.

Boxes lined the walls, stacked one atop another or set carefully out like crates. One of them emitted a high-pitched whine, driven by vibrating metal gears inside its noisy casing. Nora quickly stepped away from the box as if she hadn't seen it. It wasn't the only source of clamor in the room, either – several electronic devices and generators were running in various corners or halfheartedly whirring overhead.

Each door held a number. Nora reached for hers, but her fingers passed right through it until she tapped the steel frame. She jerked back with a gasp of surprise.

She'd heard stories about people losing their touch because they weren't paying attention to surroundings, so she made herself focus on the locker itself. Another profile, maybe, or a new material? She gave the last few drawers lining the wall another quick pass before mentally shaking herself. Looking at nothing but each object came easily enough. Nothing jumped out at her.

Just when Nora thought long pants might make this task easier, one of the doors opened and a crisply attired woman strode into view. The runner's crisp black dress caught Nora's eye first, then the way she filled it out, bangs drawn back in place. Spots of color adorned her glossy dark hair, which was pulled up loosely on top of her head.

In addition to the outfit, the woman carried a sleek tool belt worn over one shoulder, and she wore medium heels that added another inch to her height. Nora took in the entire ensemble, which turned up at the collar of the shirt as if it had been cinched there.

That outfit and the crisp walk made Nora think of military uniforms, but the woman wasn't armed except by her eyes.

381,0.8,0.6,1.0,78.0,8,41.0,"Upstairs, she passed through the noisy dining hall filled with groans and curses as colonists struggled to break their fasts. As she walked, more than a few yawned at how late it still was.

When Nora reached the mess room, no one else seemed inclined to start working. She picked up her tray and was surprised to find another bowl of scrambled eggs lying in wait for her.

Grimly, Nora pushed aside her own hunger and added the eggs to her stack. The others in the mess had long since finished eating. They looked exhausted and bleary eyed. A man sat alone in the far corner with his head in his hands. He slumped forward, his elbows resting on the table.

Outside, Nora found that her breakfast plate was already empty again. She ate quickly and retired to her quarters. There she set about repairing a problem she'd encountered earlier in the day. If she left the defective joints uncovered too long, they wouldn't be able to withstand her next use of the equipment, like a building being unsafe because its foundation cracked. Her shift had only just begun before she was forced to call time and leave the job incomplete. She dressed again and returned to the work site.

Her stomach growling, she stumbled into the engineering bays across from the dormitories. Several colonists were stationed there to fix the night's problems. The morning's repair crew was busy making inventory lists, checking inventory, and noting down maintenance tasks due throughout the ensuing week.

Nora pulled her jacket over her shirt as she walked through the cramped space, her eyes scanning ahead for any sign of an issue. The room had a row of desks and racks, each one piled high with wires, motors, gears, switches, batteries, and other shabby tools. It resembled a toolbox overload.

She reached the end of the workshop and turned to begin inspecting the control panel in the bay's back wall, which controlled the power plant directly above them. The heavy mass of heavy machinery made it hard to see the problem, but Nora saw enough to know what might have gone wrong. She stepped forward to show the gaunt cabinet the switch required.

The gaunt cabinet snapped open like a steel claw before her face.

She tumbled backward, giving herself wisps of gray hair and scraped hands on metal plates and the floor. To block from sight, Nora slammed her shoulder and hip into the thick edge of the black cabinet. She groaned beneath her breath as her new bruises protested at her clumsiness. Only after she heard the raspy sound of air escaping her lungs did she realize her fumble trapped a loose wire between her chest and the edge of the cabinet, ultimately wedging her inside.

Her heart strained in panic as she tried to reach her hand out far enough to feel for another way out while also trying not to make any more noise. Unable to squeeze past the press bar, Nora wriggled in frustration through the gap in the panel until the weight of her body forced the upper half shut.

Nora lay panting, straining to listen for anything that would indicate the presence of aliens outside the bay.

382,0.8,0.6,1.0,86.0,7,42.0,"A few other colonists were stirring in their dormitories already. The internal comm network sputtered to life, announcing the start of the early morning. In half a dozen places, alarms began to shriek heightening tension throughout the colony.

The hallway was dim compared to its brightness earlier. A single bulb hung overhead, casting harsh illumination over splotchy grease stains and spider webs sprouting from corners. Nora wandered down long corridors of stone, noting the various artworks and murals decorating each room along the way as she passed.

At first glance, the artwork was strange. Abstract shapes swirled within black circles. Patterns of angular shapes whorled through striated columns. Each room contained odd, unsettling things.

Nora examined the walls of one particular corridor, looking at the intricate patterns. There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to them. She tapped a fingernail against the wall. They radiated outward in random, disorganized angles like black holes cast in swirling smoke.

Maybe they are words? Nora wondered. But could those drawings communicate anything like a human language?

She frowned as a glimmer caught her eye. Perhaps it is just reflecting starlight.

But when she looked closer, she realized the light wasn't coming from outside. The reflections were moving inside the room—inside the shadows beneath the swirls of abstract shapes.

Nora backed up nervously, tripping over her feet in the dark and falling into the hall. When she felt herself pressed against the floor, she tried to sit up, but the only thing keeping her conscious was the pain shooting through her head from banging it on the rough rock. She groaned. Her head simply had more painful memories than she could bear this morning.

Squinting, Nora saw movement around the corners of each shadowed image. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, of them lurking in some kind of waiting position, peering back at her with glittering eyes. It came to her that the drawings weren't just strange; they might be deadly.

Desperate, Nora scrambled away down the hallway and ducked into a narrow doorway without looking behind her. She squirmed backward, keeping one hand against the smooth stone wall for balance. What if there aren't any more paintings?

The idea made her stomach twist anxiously.

Nothingness pursued her then, as if the shadowy figures were reaching out to claim her, and Nora jerked awake again.

In a panic, she bolted from her bed. Slamming the door open, Nora threw herself onto the nearby couch, but she still couldn't get comfortable. She stared at it for too long before scrambling up again to search the sleeping quarters of her roommates. All three rooms were empty. There wasn't even dust in them, let alone beds or personal belongings.

The dormitory was completely deserted. The communal showers weren't even touched. Nora splashed water on her face from the sink, trying to wash away what sleep had done to her vision. Her brain felt fuzzy, sluggish.

383,0.8,0.6,1.0,79.0,9,46.0,"The communal hallway was dark and lit only by dim emergency lights from the ceiling fixtures overhead. Rows of doors lined the corridor. The colonists all ate together, so she passed them in twos and threes stepping over sleeping bodies curled up on bare mattresses propped at awkward angles on the floor.

Rather than take a direct route to the mess hall, Nora turned toward the nearby garage directory. She keyed open one of the locker room doors, swiped through the grid-marked poster panels just inside the entranceway, and walked out onto the backless decking on the other side.

With the metal walls and decking echoing around her and a few others hurrying through the same sequence, Nora headed for her post at the power plant. A click of boots echoed down the empty corridors until she reached the ladder leading up to the catwalks above the lawn where the reactor was housed.

Closing her eyes to the ache in her feet and legs, Nora hopped her way up the ladder and then dropped to the first catwalk. Leaning out over the railing, Nora surveyed the courtyard beyond the vegetable garden as far as she could see. She was too used to working in this neighborhood by now that she didn't pay much attention to it.

When she spotted something moving out there, Nora pointed up with one gloved finger. From the first catwalk above, the operator moved quickly to stand on a platform and peer down at her. He nodded and waved to indicate he understood.

Nora returned the gesture, but kept peering out at the darkened shrubbery surrounding the colony. Surrounded on all sides by cliffs and craggy rocks, the only land in sight had been divided into a series of cultivated paddies. A long half-moon shaped ridge separated the main buildings from those planted fields dotted around the perimeter of the colony.

After several moments, Nora noticed some movement among the dark shadows outside the colony. The dim light filtering through the windows in the power plant showed vague traces as people walked along the corridors and down the stairs. She couldn't tell how many or what their purpose was, at least not yet.

Nora's eyes lit up again when she saw someone striding purposefully toward her from one of the kitchen doors in a distant corner of the building. It was a tall, slender man with wavy brown hair and a beard trimmed to look like it might be flecked with silver hairs. He wore a thick belt buckle carved into an animal's head that seemed to be holding up his heavy leather coat like an iron collar.

She wasn't about to turn back. Nora slid out onto the walkway and raced across the landing between the two levels. She hopped down off the edge of the catwalk, pulled her boots on, and sprinted for the door the bearded stranger had entered.

The corridor beyond the door was dimly lit with soft green glow strips.

384,0.8,0.7,1.0,79.0,7,42.0,"She passed swaths of grime-covered workers filling the hallways on their way to work and ate on the run at every opportunity. She found herself grateful that the colonists were so efficient about cleaning up otherwise; she wasn't used to living in such neighborhoods. Even more curious was how they made the middle of nowhere feel like civilization?

As Nora walked, she felt a prickling sensation along the nape of her neck. A few people glanced at her in passing, then turned away as if to ignore her. There should have been more traffic today than usual. But she soon realized why the other footsteps echoed hers and slowed when they caught sight of Nora's new clothing.

The thick garment had probably gotten her much needed food, but now it was attracting attention. She looked around herself curiously. It wasn't just gathering glances from passersby. They gathered stares too, some bolder strands that seemed to be returning Nora's gaze. Some narrowed into frowns or snarls, while others grew pointed teeth.

A bolt of fear shot through Nora's gut. Tribesmen! And not at all friendly faces either. Her heels clicked as she started running, and a stretch of people parted for her passage. With each step she took toward the security office, Nora's heart pounded faster and faster with panic. No one could help her if she fell into their clutches. She ran harder, fearful they would overtake her. Hands reached out from the shadows to grab at her legs. The first person tripped and fell on their face. All the others did likewise, sprawled in front of Nora like so many flattened frogs as she barreled right past them.

Nora passed a few more doors until she reached the Security Office and burst inside. She slammed the door shut behind her and bolted it tight, her trembling fingers working quickly but nervously. In a minute, the lock clacked onto place with a satisfying click. She heaved a huge breath and tried to compose herself before turning to survey her surroundings, a look of relief washing over her face when she saw the forms littering the floor in every direction.

It wasn't the lack of bodies that made Nora feel better--the chance she had been mistaken without confirmation was a risk she'd rather avoid. But seeing the patterns of spilled coffee and breakfast items showed her she hadn't imagined the noise, either. Dozens of nervous groans greeted her. Nora flicked open her palm terminal and pressed its screen to see if any new messages were coming through that she might have missed earlier.

Before her touch, the screen flickered and she nearly crashed into the desk as a message started up with a familiar voice: Compiled security logs, Commander Kern.

I hate this app.

Nora leaned against a wall and let out a low growl.

The colony's architecture reminded anyone of a hive, but New Vector could only be found by those who were really lost. Renegades came in from deep space planets like Novac looking for opportunities, scenery, adventure, and the promise of land—which meant any individual colony was just one small unit in a vast expanse. Nora wasn't claustrophobic, so she avoided the crowded corridors where people formed clusters around the communal tables.

Nora slipped into a well-worn lab coat as she nearly ran down the stairs to the lower levels, where the command center and power plant were located. Built directly under the command center, the power plant was cramped and utilitarian. Lab coats were not uncommon after curfew, like this early morning work shift.

As Nora joined the other engineers in the corridors leading up to the lab, the alarms began buzzing again. Even amid these sounds, an eerie silence lingered above the cacophony.

An automated alarm rang through the halls as a mechanical voice said ""Alert! Alien swarm detected."" At least it sounded more pleasant than the high-pitched screech of the previous times. This time, the alert was accompanied by images projected onto the walls of metal beetle shapes, schematics for alien design, and notes about experimental data on the progress of studies.

The most shocking connection was a video of a group of scientists, including Nora's superior, Dr. Chen, being viciously attacked from behind by aliens. The footage looked real, but there were no audio tracks or interviews to provide context. It was impossible to tell how close they had really been to death. There was something disturbing, very much like torture, in their fear and pain, even in the way they fought back.

""Oh my God, what are those?"" Nora breathed as she watched a scientist with hair pulled out clumps by his scalp while he writhed and screamed through broken ribs.

Nora joined other engineers at the edge of the cracks in the flooring where overhead lights flickered fitfully, stuttering to life only seconds before switching off again. Someone must be proactive about fixing the problems.

Her eyes shifted uneasily along the corridor as her thoughts returned to the urgent matter of the alarm, which had stopped.

Backing down the stairs toward the lab, she couldn't see anything wrong. When she reached the surface level, Nora felt the tremors of movement beneath her feet before hearing them, but they were subdued—less like an earthquake than someone shuffling their boots. Her ears were filled with slow breathing, barely loud enough to register.

They're coming now! It took a moment for it to sink in. The attack will come from every direction unless we stop them.

The campus was still growing with new structures slickened by layers of colored paint. Colorful flora grew over stone walls and green sprouted from cracks in the paving stones in neat, controlled rows of plant beds.

A low, soft hum filled the morning air as Nora approached the command center. Her boots echoed on the smooth floors as she crossed the expansive open courtyard leading to the building. A busy corridor lined one wall with workstations where colonists pored over information screens. Computer systems monitored every aspect of the colony, but engineers like Nora had to be human too.

She leaned into a workstation counter and slid her ID card across it. ""Be safe.""

""Your safety is my concern,"" the automated computer replied. Its voice was neutral female, and its concern lay in the fact that this duty required personal interaction. It would rather someone else take up the task than have Nora waste time answering inquiries.

Nora nodded and returned her ID card to her pocket as she passed through the door into the command center, which was barely four meters high and only two wide. Walls were bare metal. Kneeling cubicles filled niches around the room. Handheld holographic projectors emitted images of other tasks in progress. A long conference table dominated the center space with panels on both sides. Cables ran along the length of it, branching off to distant corners as they disappeared through ceiling vents.

At the end of the command center, three men sat at a computer station dotted by monitors. Two wore leather jackets over shaven heads sheathed in shaved hair; one wore a similar jacket with a long pigtail hanging loose from under his collarbone. They glanced at Nora briefly before returning their attention to their terminals. She saw them through a slender camera projected onto an overhead monitor.

Noin did not wear the jacket, but he had chosen a short haircut over his bald head. He stared unblinking into the camera as if it were a slate of stone. For a man who always looked so calm and collected, Nora thought he was wearing very little makeup for this shift. In fact, she could see wrinkles forming in faint creases between his eyebrows as well as several more tiny folds bracketing his eyes. His skin still hung on him like sheets of paper thinned out and stretched to near transparency.

They all appeared oblivious to Nora until she entered the command center and stood beside one of the chairs. Then Noin turned his scarred face toward her, casually wiping crumbs from under his nose with a dark finger as if they weren't important enough for any concern. ""It's fifteen minutes,"" he said to the others in the room, ""I'll stay late and let you catch up.""

The other two men nodded and returned their attention to their own workstations.

387,0.8,0.8,1.0,77.0,7,45.0,"Levels of the main corridor were empty at that early hour. The lights were dimmed, but the air still held a chill. Nora left a pile of clothes in the laundry room and headed for the cafeteria.

The halls echoed with only her footsteps and those of others commuting on duty. She passed many colonists seated around tables, eating quietly. Security staff patrolled the corridors in pairs. Some drank coffee while others worked through stacks of paperwork in offices cluttered with collections of papers. Most people wore the same drab coveralls that Nora did. Only their hairstyles distinguished them.

Nora could smell cooking from the cafeteria as she walked along the hallway. She paused at one point to look into the common lounges in search of her crewmates. Two men sat side by side, murmuring in low voices over a mug of tea. One was tall and green-eyed, the other stocky with gray hair.

Her gaze found another man who nodded hello as he passed Nora. Beside him stood a woman with short dark hair and glasses. Scars crisscrossed her face like the branches of an oak tree, leaving a web of brown lines across her skin and making a prominent impression on her dark eyes.

Nora frowned at the sight. She made a note to ask about it later and continued down the corridor in search of breakfast.

The cafeteria was full of bustling activity as Nora approached the line for food. Its light hum of conversation comforted her. No matter how exhausting her shifts were, there was always something fun to do around people. Today had been no exception.

She stepped into the queue of colonists waiting for tables and ordered food with practiced ease. They seemed to know what they wanted without even being told, which was good because Nora didn't eat much. She smiled at one woman as she waited in line and received a cheerful greeting back.

A few minutes after Nora arrived, the busy room fell silent with a crowd's collective intake of breath as a new set of arrivals entered the cafeteria.

Nora heard more than saw them before they reached her table. Her heart skipped a beat while her lungs caught asthmatic breaths and her mind strained its visual cortex to piece together the scene. With sheer force of will, she held her attention to the task at hand-- ordering breakfast-- until it became detached from her conscious decision to ignore the strange feeling that was tickling her spine.

Then the lights went out.

Nora gave a small squeak and jerked backward into the chair behind her.

388,0.8,0.8,1.0,74.0,9,43.0,"The dormitories were starkly lit by artificial lights, pale squares flickering from the walls around the narrow corridors. Rows of doors opened onto each side of the halls with short hallways opening off the rows for personal bunks stacked three high in the wall. She made her way through the dim tunnels to the kitchen where she could hear the patter of water droplets hitting the tiles. The corridor was loud with the sound of dripping, rattling pipes and electricity humming from unseen generators. Lines of glowing display panels along one wall gave directions for meal preparation.

The vast kitchen was a place of bright stainless steel and glass. Every surface in sight had been scrubbed and cleaned; the tanks on counters brimmed with clear liquid. Stainless steel stoves ran the length of the room. Shelves were stocked with metallic pots, pans, and utensils. Nora paused at the doorway to assess the situation, then walked past row after row of hotplates, deep fryers, pressure cookers, and other equipment that rose up toward the ceiling like an erupting volcano in burning coals.

She reached the far end of the long dining area where she found a counter of fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. Narrow dishes lined shelves that already overflowed with plates, bowls, and glasses waiting to be assembled. A large industrial oven stood on the opposite side of the room, its door open to allow in thick, steaming smoke.

Nora walked to the sink next to it. She lifted her hand from the tap so water would run freely and studied the contents of every dish, looking for signs that anything or anyone had visited recently. The ceramic tiled floor reflected no lights nor shadows and made the only light visible. Only when Nora's eyes finally adjusted did she see the small security monitor nestled in a corner behind the steamy opening to the oven, hanging about seven feet above the floor.

She sighed and turned back to the food racks before reaching down to twist off a few items, setting them aside. Patience was not Nora's strong suit, but that wasn't an excuse for starting an early lunch without warning the others. They needed enough time to get ready and eat breakfast before starting their day.

Returning to the pipes and gratings of the kitchen, Nora cranked open a panel in the wall. She tore out a bundle of yellow electrical wires. With practiced ease, she stripped the wires and twisted them together with an audible click. Then, over the sound of flowing water, she whistled through her teeth as she started working on the wires.

389,0.8,0.8,1.0,86.0,7,43.0,"The hallways were empty except for the tired-looking maintenance man tending to a flickering light fixture. He nodded when he noticed her approach, and she said good morning as she passed them. The main entrance at the end of the hallway was already open as she made her way toward a large ceramic plate on the wall where pancakes awaited. She scooped up several and found a fork in one of the nearby holders.

A slight gust fluttered the edges of Nora's thin cotton shirt; she tucked it under her arm for warmth while gripping the tray of food, and walked down the slope of the hill toward the dormitories. Her eyes scoured the grounds as she descended. Everything seemed to be secured from the outside, but how many drones lurked in each corner?

Malfunction and repair had become routine for her these days—a job of tedious repetition. She pressed on, not looking up even once until the doors parted and allowed her entry into the living quarters.

The hallways were smaller and more cramped than those of the administrative wing; small, snug rooms built like closets lined both sides of the corridor, leaving enough space for one person to move through. Nora shuffled past several other colonists as she turned right at the first intersection. The opening of the door beyond revealed a shared bathroom with several toilet stalls. It was illuminated by a single light and must have been intended to resemble an upscale hotel suite.

Toiletries crowded a rack beside the sinks, which sparkled with glass and metal crystalline fixtures that caught her attention. ""Hey!"" she called out. A man passing by glanced back with annoyed surprise. But while he may have thought she spoke too loudly, Nora wasn't worried about upsetting anyone. She'd already passed four people; there was no need to stop now.

Four colonist faces swiveled toward Nora as the group moved forward, and she paused as they approached. Wordlessly, the front line shifted behind her, moving almost imperceptibly into formation around her.

She took a sharp breath and stared at each face in turn. She recognized everyone, though their expressions differed wildly. One woman's cheeks were flushed red, her eyes leaking tears. Her gaze was fixed somewhere on the wall, and she trembled visibly; she couldn't seem to look anywhere else. Another woman bared her teeth as if spitting venomous words. An older man had a hand clamped to his forehead, and another barely even registered Nora's presence. Nearly every person had made it this far without incident, but tiresome repetition was driving them mad.

Guilt twisted inside Nora's stomach at the realization of what she had wrought. Even if she tried to help these people, she would have failed or done more harm than good.

390,0.8,0.9,1.0,69.0,6,43.0,"Nora tried to take deep breaths as she passed the rows of sleeping quarters, her mind focused on the upcoming day's repairs. Safety first, always safety. But in the back of her thoughts, she knew it wouldn't be long until someone else died if something wasn't done about the Colony's ongoing troubles.

Day Five

In dire need of a rest, Sully woke up early. He ducked under the bed frame and strode out of his room to get a head start on the day. A quick shower--well, he'd earned it after the previous night's sleep--and a cup of hot coffee calmed him down.

He needed to focus. The colony was clinging to survival at any cost. If they started losing too many people... Sully shook his head. Nora would come through, no matter what happened.

Sully quickly dressed in the space suit that hung on the wall, a relic from when the colony still had a pilot who could fly its vehicle out into space. Its creaky joints rasped as Sully pulled on the waist leathers and paused to look out the window.

The sun was just rising, diffusing gold rays over the dunes-like cliffs surrounding the craggy rocks. It lit the sky with dancing orange streaks. The white clouds were darkening and turning pink. Above, the starfield glowed in purple and rose.

Frozen, Sully watched the landscape shift and sigh. Stiffly he turned away from the glass and stalked downstairs. His steps echoed along the dusky corridors.

Nora must have already left. She was always early for her shift.

Whistling a rousing tune, Sully sang to himself as he took the stairs up toward the command center's conference room. He stepped into silence and stopped short in shock at the scene before him. People sat on chairs, sleeping bags, or used their legs like pillows. Intrusions marked where others stood as they peered into monitors.

And from the corners of his eyes Sully caught glimpses of people hiding in shadowed corners, silently watching him through haze-covered glasses.

Sully recoiled back against the doorframe. You're hearing things. It's your imagination.

His heart pounded, and despite himself he looked around warily.

No one seemed to notice the intruder. They were too absorbed in their work or watching screens.

When he finally regained his nerve, Sully carefully opened the conference room door. No other spacesuits indicated that the room was occupied. He crept inside and closed the door behind him.

Clumps of fiber-optic cables snaked across the smooth floor between the various tables. A dark shape hunched at one corner, its back to Sully. It scuffed forward, crunching the fibers and sending a wake of sparks.

Sully took small, cautious steps until he could just make out someone in the shadows.

391,0.8,0.9,1.0,73.0,8,47.0,"At least, Nora thought, she wouldn't be working again this morning. The Company had just dismissed the previous shift an hour ago, giving her time to get proper rest since a new maintenance machine was scheduled for installation on what they called C Level later in the day.

For now, Nora headed downstairs past the common area where colonists gathered by the wall screen or the small bar they maintained for their own use. A few early risers were already sitting at the wooden tables or huddling around small vid screens set up for news and entertainment, but most of the colonists hunkered down in the living conditions like Nora herself.

She squeezed through the main hallway after a few steps and took the opening door to C level, passing unused steel plates littered with dirty boots. Compared to the first two floors, C Level had fewer rooms at about double the number on B and below. They seemed too large.

There was no third floor to make things feel cozy. These spaces weren't designed that way.

Nora walked past the bar and past a dining nook on her right and exited into C level's center court, which contained the large central arena. To her immediate left stood the storage room. The station was shaped oddly, supported at the outer edges and finished off by four massive and towering concrete domes. But it really didn't matter how the building looked—the best engineers in Company history had built the space stations long ago, and now that Nora served as one of those engineers, the results were predictable.

The equipment kept failing. And while the delivery schedules got shorter, the colonists' workload was only increasing. One malfunction could mean that the work crew would need to hold an entire shift without power to fix it. Two meant they'd have to postpone a scheduled cargo shipment, and three or more and well... Nora would be hearing them complain about the latest schedule change any day now.

Those problems inevitably led to people getting ill and injured from working longer, harder shifts. That ended up causing further delays.

No wonder the Company wanted to send a ship here. The colonists needed supplies, and morale was almost nonexistent. Even with company resources, the colony was still operating at less than half capacity. The colonists needed structure. And they needed someone like Nora.

Her parents had been engineers, but despite their hard work and training, they had died soon after she was born. She had no siblings; there were never enough hands for multiple jobs of one kind or another. Nora learned early on that her strength came in handy when dealing with broken machinery. It made sense to pluck out the best personnel scientists could find for engineering. But it also meant that the Company had to pay a premium for each person they hired—which they were always short on.

392,0.8,0.9,1.0,83.0,5,44.0,"As she passed her dormitory door, she startled at a sudden influx of noise from within. She stopped abruptly, turned inward because the volume wasn't tolerable anymore. The hallway was still empty.

Nora paused in the corridor to listen. Someone was awake. A woman? There were voices. But they weren't traditional human, like her own. They weren't so much words as grunts, mewling sounds... maybe different languages? Noise filled the halls and rumbled through her bones until it shook the muscles in her jaw.

She tried to strike the door open but found it locked. Somebody was inside. Nora kicked herself for being so slow to protect herself. This wasn't on her schedule, but there wasn't time to go back to bed. She forced the lock with her palms, hoping and praying her makeshift key would hold.

The door opened with a hiss. Nora blinked in surprise as the room swam into focus. Athenas stood naked in front of her thrall, crouched on hands and knees, surrounded by a semicircle of three other men. Two women, also nude, sat cross-legged across from the four immortals, listening intently.

""What is that?"" a fourth male asked, voice raised above the rest. His hair was streaked gray at the temples, skin weathered dark, and he had a brush cut. He wore a vest, loose pants, and sandals with dark leather soles.

An immortal wearing the same outfit grunted in response, but he held no weapon. Most likely, he couldn't or wouldn't use one here and now. In the wake of violence, all mortals learned they were disposable—and mortal weapons would certainly do more harm than good here. The aliens operated on different rules altogether.

Nora took a second look under those naïve eyes, this time allowing herself to see the lethal beauty as she appraised him. Blood stained his broad shoulders and abdomen. It clotted thickly over pale scars across both collarbones; a flensing scar like the ones that turned skin white, not red. Almost imperceptibly fine lines scored his muscled arms and haunches from shoulder to wrist.

He was definitely an ancient, but Nora wasn't sure if he'd claimed her yet. She worried about that for a moment while he crouched barefoot in front of Athenas.

""Why are you here?"" the strange man demanded again. ""You have no right.""

Nora thought he was the one talking to her before, but it might've been someone else. After a moment, she decided on audacity. The tiredness from lack of sleep had fled in the face of these creatures.

Checking to make certain Athens's thrall hadn't suffered any visible injuries, Nora stepped into the room. ""Would you mind translating so I can understand what you're saying?""

His dark eyes snapped to hers. They were flat and black as coal. The color seemed rich here without reflecting starlight or daylight. He didn't shift expression or show even a hint of suspicion, though she doubted she'd fooled him at all. In fact he regarded her with interest.

""What do you want?"" he asked coldly.

393,0.9,0.4,1.0,59.0,10,42.0,"Outside, she stepped through the open doorway to find herself facing a long deck with staggering views to either side. The rising sun painted the world around them in a blood-red haze; rising out of the horizon, stars shone faintly from a diffuse sky.

It was early morning. That much was obvious even though clouds swallowed up the first tier of stratus that was supposed to be above the colony's settlement. Beyond the portend overhang Nora could glimpse waves crashing at the base of boulders and gargantuan cliffs, crests billowing close enough to trip over the jagged rocks sticking like fins.

She paused when she came to the end of the portside corridor, watching the sea unfold like a brilliant blur beyond the ruins of several abandoned mining complexes. A host of ships dotted their way along the horizonline, sails rigged and dangling as they cruised eastward under a lacy gray cap of cloud. Debris littered scattered blocks where buildings had been knocked down for new structures, weathering corrugated metal sheets with rents and vents that leaked leaking wind. No one was sleeping here.

Nora stared at the shipworks, basking in silence but suddenly reminded that in moments she would be responsible for commanding a group of workers. Already salivating to seal her report notes and call the worker shifts, Nora looked back on what she had planned today and shook her frizzy head in dismay.

Each day here felt just as riddled with peculiarities. The colonists never seemed to stop going about their business. They didn't pause to admire the wide vistas or take dramatic selfie pics like she'd seen tourists do to portfolds, so aside from minor inconveniences of unfamiliar flora and fauna not many diversions were available. If you weren't ready and rested when your shift started it took some effort to find time to sleep enough hours in rowdy dorms. Often, there weren't enough feet to go around, sales clerks loathed it when Nora tried purchasing extra shoes in sizes too small, and employees couldn't be made to understand that weekends meant downtime. Any misstep could mean being sent home frozen by the heat until late Monday if your work slipped past everyone else.

The arriving merchant ships arrived jarred most people out of slumber. While the night sky expressed itself in the gentle sound of gull cries, cargo packages shipped into Noosphere's orbit woke everyone up on schedule using boomers rigged to impressively boring symphonies. The cheering cheers and boisterous hull noise of landing craft transported raw materials from the planet, bringing cargo goods up the docking tubes from warehouses.

Adventurers dropped in every now and then. But after their brief stay they departed to assume other challenges in faraway universes with names Nora wished she knew better, leaving behind small groups of dedicated crew that worked exhaustingly hard through lockouts.

Locked-in times were sometimes fun. Entering a bunker and walking along the aisle between berthing craft was one experience Nora enjoyed more than once when luck allowed. But to say hello to life as twenty-four hours, Nora had no time at all left. Every aspect of her day would have to be orchestrated perfectly or risk catastrophe. She set half the normal closing shifts for herself to avoid boredom.

394,0.9,0.4,1.0,73.0,9,38.0,"Fluffy white clouds pressed close above the morning sun scudding across darkened hillsides, but the wind cut remarking particles of frost from the air in uneven swirls. A few drifts lingered near the eaves where lines of delicate icicles reached for the stones of the cliffside like tiny fangs. The snowy caps of distant crags reflected starlight, amplifying it until their peaks burned vast as the eye could perceive. Cold air at Nora's back sunk its fingers deep into her hair. She shivered automatically then shuddered at the new wave of cold through the poundingly heavy clothes and boots she wore.

She walked down a hallway toward the cafeteria area of the mess hall, her footsteps echoing oddly in the silence. It was still dawn, though sunrise could arrive hours later than when the standard clock reading struck six o'clock as set on the wall hourglasses.

The walls of brown concrete were laden with maps protruding from plastic sleeves and framed pictures stuck into decorative frames, printed outside with calligraphy proclaiming the major events in the colony's history and narrated by automated collectors. There were lots of them.

Nora smiled faintly at one or another every time she passed it, but today her thoughts drifted from that reminder to other matters. She missed Molly, her best friend, who had been stationed on Presley's Promise only a few years ago while Nora fought high gravity over interstellar space, not knowing if it would be her final home or just a stopover among humans during her journey.

None of the girls were around now. Nora trusted Rob and Norma, her engineer friends, enough to share some secrets about her fears, but she hadn't told either of them anything lately. Their kind of friendship was broken. All of her other close associates lived or worked elsewhere. The unspoken truth behind the absence left an unpleasant taste in everyone's mouth.

Frowning, Nora continued down the halls. She stopped outside a doors labeled with the numeral fourteen and tried to concentrate on upending another annoyance under her hat instead of rather more important problems weighing on her nerves.

Doubt crept into the back of her head as she stood atop a digital countdown clock with swirling numbers ticking audibly around its screen, counting seconds from sunrise until her shift started. Whoever had designed this planet wasn't planning to come again for at least six months after Nora's radiation treatments were complete, so they couldn't start their regular routine without waiting through two seasons like these.

A rustling behind her caught Nora's attention before she even realized it. She pivoted on her heel while yanking the door open. A man wearing threadbare coveralls and a cap set the moving digits forward by one digit and she shifted out of his way in time to avoid stomping him flat as he lurched past in tottering balance.

Her senses flickered as her heart sped up in panic, but the man was unarmed and clearly unable to hear. Maybe he was clumsy or sick, not a common problem on Presley's Promise. Or maybe he was...

""Hello?"" Nora said tentatively. ""Excuse me? Are you okay?""

The man whirled around at the sound of her voice with a wide, childlike grin redoubled with tooth gaps.

395,0.9,0.4,1.0,77.0,7,45.0,"A buzzer caught the attention of another engineer at the end of the hall, but none seemed to notice her as she walked past their rooms. She heard murmured conversations in each room as she went by until she reached the main communal area, where the sound died away. In here, all anyone could do was speak louder than usual to be sure people overheard them.

Walking down the long corridor, two of the colonists recognized Nora's name and waved. One gave a friendly greeting while the other smiled slightly with cold politeness.

Nora returned the smiles but kept moving. Human variation aside, most colonists universally did not like her. She was smart enough to make it onto Sully's list as needing supervision. But Nora didn't need his approval. One of the men had made fun of Nora's flying ability the day before, causing a near brawl in the gymnasium that had come dangerously close to an actual fight. He'd gotten Cody Crosby thrown off the project for half a shift. Like that was any kind of punishment. All he'd wanted was for everyone else to run back into danger along with him, getting some fresh spit on her face.

It wouldn't have happened if not for this project. Nora sighed.

Nora! There was no harm in looking good when it would save your life. Nothing bad about working herself into exhaustion to match her physical capabilities. Maybe even being a little rough around the edges would help her let go of her guilt and stop feeling sorry for herself.

She reached the communal dining hall, where volunteers were already waiting with trays filled with hot food. Nora quickly asked a young woman where she could find Nigel, the food prep supervisor. The plump female looked tired as she pointed toward one of the dished ports at the far end of the room. ""Come on, Nora,"" said her companion. ""A bowl of porridge isn't going to fix anything.""

Nora sighed internally. For someone who wasn't worried about panicking or suffering, that was quite a rude comment. Nonetheless, still figuring out how everyone's schedules worked, she followed the flatfoot towards one of several port tables where a human-sized chair with padded seats stood ready for her. She took it, hoping for more than just a bowl of warmed up grainy mush.

A woman approached, a couple paces ahead. Nora recognized Alison, one of the short hairy men from the crew list. When their eyes met, both women straightened.

""Morning, Als!"" Nora exclaimed cheerfully.

Alison only sneered. ""Good morning."" Her lips tightened.

The gardener approached briskly then stopped when she saw Nora sitting down with a mug of sludgy porridge in front of her. ""Are you sure old Nigel has been fed?"" the gardener asked almost plaintively, accusing.

Nora lined up three full mugs and headed back toward table ten. Behind her, the two security guards chuckled to themselves.

Most of the colonists had demonstrated varying degrees of affection for Nora. She was too single to be lonely, but on evenings like this they barely paid attention to anything besides their meals and work.

396,0.9,0.5,1.0,78.0,10,41.0,"The hallway locations were utilitarian but private, hidden behind thick metallic walls without doorways. Pale bolts of faded sunlight gleamed off smooth surfaces and gloomy corners. Long corridors stretched across the way. Doorways defined new hallways extending out of the dense shadows into deeper parts of the complex. People picked up their pace to avoid having to stop at junctions to double back, probably because the same level might have two entrances instead of just one.

She emerged in her assigned section of the dormitory in no particular hurry. Eleven other engineers lived here, not counting herself.

Nora had been tasked with keeping things running smoothly; that meant keeping the colony running. The Company made sure people worked long hours so they could work harder. Filing maintenance requests took first priority. Repair crews attended anything immediate. But repair schedules were tentative, shift assignments were inflexible, and supplies came in irregular intervals, which caused them to run low on essentials faster than expected. Nora was responsible for working around equipment malfunctions and coming up with solutions quickly.

She jogged down a cramped corridor, slowing as she approached the small locker room filled with vending machines and lockers. Most of the Company here preferred body armor over utility clothes. An urgent hum from the power plant pulsed through the wall. Nora nodded greeting at her fellow engineers, who gave way before ducking into showers. One tidied his queue, fixing it. He looked troubled.

A large horizontal window cut across the corridor end opposite the laundry and shower rooms. Through the pane, Nora saw company executives arriving in gleaming suits and blue ties to inspect other sections of the complex. That only meant more problems were ahead; bridgeheads between supply ships and distant stations were unreliable. Delivery time varied wildly and landing ports opened where they pleased. It was pure luck if a ship landed close enough to get fuel or food to service stations on time, much less assemble maintenance teams when requested. To get fuel while carrying cargo on the return trip, some ships ran reduction reels on the moment they arrived at planets using high yield materials like copper minerals, which could regenerate a depleted rack and keep them running indefinitely. But that drastically reduced their speed.

The Company didn't include tradesmen in the grading system. And without durable, easily maintained vehicles for them to pick up remaining cargo once returning, some ships sold most of what was collected before setting off again, consuming the excess stores.

On this steamy planet, clouds of dust and salt haze hung in the air. Over every horizon, it billowed out miles and miles until not even a mountain peak broke the hazy veil.

397,0.9,0.5,1.0,66.0,11,39.0,"The hallway was eerily silent. With only two other colonists present still reliant upon Instrumentality to run their lives, the colony sat alone on a barren planet amid deep interstellar distances—none of them having proper transport capabilities. Ancient infrastructures clung dearly to life even though no one could be bothered from tearing them out and replacing them just yet.

Nora shivered in the cold air as she made for the dining hall. When she looked up, it took her eyes several seconds to adjust to the dimness after entering the main corridor. Her boots creaked as they touched metal floors; the harsh tone hit her senses first.

Modern society was structured around decades of research and development efforts. But most technical advances didn't come cheap. And after initial acquisition, a lifetime's worth of maintenance costs ate away at every use. The Company provided the tools, but people were called on to sustain their own living conditions. Where organic life had given way mostly to plastics and synthetic proteins, humans needed reliable technological support to maintain well-being and full productivity.

And so Presley's Promise emerged like a bunch of outcasts clinging tightly to their prey and hoping for the best. But despite this fragile structure, there was an illegible tension here. Mist hung above cobblestone floors that bore many scars—two gashes had been patched with synthite—and shadows filled corners. Even at precisely noon, the colony shielded itself from annoying sunlight room temperature that precariously ticked upward and brought the unpleasant reality of what awaited on these halls.

Nora begrudgingly perceived a faint tang in the air indicative of a working heater—but it suggested insecurity to Nora as much as comfort. Confronting undue desperation, it almost demanded an investigator's insights within a space that one could not find unless willing to primary it.

She stepped cautiously into the shadows at a corner, brushed aside ropy curtain strands to cast herself inside and begin fumbling haphazard paths through the dark passage before beginning to warm up.

A small figure crouched against the wall next to her, watching quietly in curious silence, its feet quiet on stone. And from within the pallor of skin and far more conservative apparatus found off the colony, a lone pair of pale blue eyes glinted.

The presence stared at Nora without animus. It'd simply watched her file by despite not being formally introduced. Its steady scrutiny was only an observation; it wasn't suspicious, merely observing when and how often Nora did anything seemingly out of the ordinary.

The Spyder materialized at exactly noon by the command console, where the colony's Doctor Trader, Fred Krugmeyer, stood with his spaceman cohort, Raek Jamison. The time tracking device inside played in its ear-loop as it unbuttoned its coverall jumpsuit and folded itself into a chair on the metal floor. The exercise movements were effortless, every joint gracefully articulated down to each knuckle. Bare skin gleamed faintly silver. A nearby arch flashed from overlapping perspectives;

398,0.9,0.5,1.0,73.0,10,38.0,"The hallway outside her room split in two directions like a common corridor at a multi-story building, each direction ending in another row of identical doorways. She followed the path to the left until she reached the main cafeteria where she could see three glimpses down rows of long, metal tables stretching toward the far wall. Empty places marked the offshoots of the main hallway leading to one end of this central area and the dormitories at the other.

Feeling slightly ill, Nora sat down at the section seat farthest from the doors. While hungry colonists wandered through the cafeteria lines, clumped together over food trays and conversation. The lights dimmed. A quiet chime sounded as automated order forms gradually filled up with food preferences. The rows of seats lowered, lowering only enough to make a rudimentary chair available for Nora's thin calves. They sat in silence. It was a typical morning here on the tundra planet — a sad but humdrum affair full of small chores.

Breakfast arrived first. Both gut and nervous system knocked it back her body at breakneck speed. Nora managed all of twenty seconds before walking straight out of the room in search of work. She rushed down the passageway to cross the central commons again, dodging past well-wishers and guests clad in finery driving their personal Flocks or cars into the launch bay.

She found what she needed in a nearby corridor — a metal counter, something bolted to a bulkhead unoccupied except for some food wrappers. This place had half a dozen identical cafeteria machines, each one apparently set aside for staff use until rolls of new supplies were acquired in the outer halls or resupply flocks were loaded to leave. Creating a ruse intentionally or not, Nora used this separate machine to hide out in.

Nora unfolded herself from the cramped booth and stretching her hands towards an overhead rack before swinging up and climbing. Removing a sack from the top shelf, she moved to the nearest eat-in table twice as wide as could occupy any human elbow, and pulled the rations out with a series of clangs and twos. Slotted openings released individual packets labeled each for its specific purpose, mealtime rotation or mine hard labor duty assignment. Scraps on the floor between tables littered every surface and bore no resemblance to neatly organized meals. Unidentifiable grey chunks probably comprised processed animal parts. Yellowed ones must be slices of partially cooked meat. Contorted samples of sausages existed alongside burnt orbs of dough, unrecognizable lumps of glop whose purpose wasn't immediately obvious. Beside Nora's table, the cafeteria layout was like a nest of giant insects, all of which scuttled here and there along their assigned routes on tiny wire legs that constantly changed shape. A tapestry overhead swept all directions in still-moving blacks and whites. The mild heat inside recycled stale air.

399,0.9,0.6,1.0,56.0,4,40.0,"Nora crossed the littered loading bay from the dormitory lounge to the other side of the power plant through the yawning airlock once again. When she emerged into the administrative section, Sully called out from where he sat at a high table in one corner of the room while Paddy flicked valves and sifted through logs of tech reports behind him.

""Morning, nymph,"" said Sully. ""Awake?""

""Of course I am."" Nora grinned ruefully. ""Only the best engineers sleep late."" She headed toward the small kitchen area attached to the engineering bays, and Sully followed.

""So did you hear about our little glitch last night?"" he asked, waggling his bushy eyebrows under the rim of his hat. He leaned forward so the buttons on his gray shirt strained over his gut and tucked his salt-and-pepper beard neatly. The contrast against his fair skin was unusual, but it worked.

""Ugh. Knee joint on the food processor shorted out. Poor thing looks like some egg's been hatched inside a metal box,"" Nora replied as she chopped vegetables for breakfast.

Sully snorted, shaking his head at the biting wit of her joke, then paused in his cutting at her words.

Fair does fine, Nora... he thought. Just stay away from Driscol until this is over with.

""What do we got in supply today?"" Sully railed, returning to his hacking and slicing.

Nora shrugged. ""How should I know? Director sent me on alone after Big Board closed because he's too busted to get up right now. Did you call one of the techs?""

Paddy spoke up. ""No need—we got most of the work done yesterday."" He rearranged his fingers and thumb, pressing them against each other at the seams of his white coat, while Nora scratched her chin with a fork.

""Should have called him. Aren't there two holding shootouts each day?"" Nora quipped dryly.

Paddy puckered his lips. ""Yeah, but they never took us last night. There hasn't been any trouble in a week."" His face scrunched in suspicion; his eyes narrowed. Then, his usual jovial expression returned. Picking up on it, Nora started to chuckle.

Sully stopped chewing whatever raw meat he'd been working with abruptly. ""Dropped my tray,"" he said in his normal hoarse voice. He bent down to make some adjustments at the brown wrappings lying on the floor. ""Looks like we're gonna be busy today.""

""Okay, you two. We've got business to take care of—""

""Aw, leave her alone,"" scoffed Sully. ""We put this place together and keeping our own house clean ain't one of the charges.""

400,0.9,0.6,1.0,83.0,10,39.0,"With an indifferent nod at a nearby sentry whose guns gleamed wetly in the faint light, Nora set off for the mess hall. Her boots clomped audibly. All around her garish red lettering advertised the makeup and moisturiser provided by Company Cosmetics; while below that, arched in gothic script above the big photo of a beautiful woman sat two tiny words: About Your Face!

Tough! Fast and reasonably pretty. Of real interest to the drones, a nitpicker had once remarked on how Nora's eyes seemed a little too green for a human, so the cosmetic company models could be seen with their stern gray-green irises peering out.

Something bright and arbitrary caught Nora's attention before she reached the base of the next stair upwards. Curious, Nora followed one of the treacherous glow streaks up five flights of stairs towards the top. The stunted glowing blobs eventually vanished into a dim chamber, their trail leaving behind them an ever so faint shimmering curtain across the way where they'd gone, but not what lay beyond that.

Nora halted within the brightly lit mess, catching her breath after the climb to look over the banquette in front of her. She blinked and looked down at herself as if seeing her for the first time instead of just noting from the waist level that her boots gave off a muffled thud with every step she took. Black scalp tumbled out of her messy black hair, frameless glasses flipped up and goggles dangled around the contours of her large ears, and her torso and limbs were wrapped in a maroon fabric jumpsuit like something out of a tour boat brochure.

Now you can wear impossibly beautiful fabrics without enduring stingy water droplets running down your body or tar-covered umbrellas nudging their way into your drink. Yes, these fabrics are made of cutting edge synthetic materials that do not melt – no matter how much champagne is poured over it. Want to feel fresh and luxurious? Pick your length, color and pattern before sliding into this soft, quick-dry kick-ass suit. Are we there yet? No. We're so close, shall we say?

The gleaming skin below the bubbly coral froth was rosy and shiny from a decadent sunbathing under the strict gaze of the sun's rays. The bright lighting along part of the rim cut into that gentle curve at its outer edge into hillocks of silvery foam glowing dazzlingly atop jade circles spinning as if they were planets or moons around a supermassive red one shining with a different brilliance set high above the horizon spanning many glowplicated bands of purple displaying an almost actual tangerine hue. A wide range of bubbles motored lazily through the rising surface, so fast and agitating they nearly defied reality, and resembled colored frostings. Those same colors! Oh, anyone would think those were gorgeous, were they not tainted with their horror!

401,0.9,0.6,1.0,82.0,10,46.0,"She followed the routine walkway that ran around buildings at ground level until she reached the cafeteria. The corridors were crowded but everyone present seemed to know where they wanted to be, so Nora forced herself into the slow line she well knew from years of assignments. Working up another patience while she waited, Nora set her thoughts in neutral until it no longer felt like time would crawl past as fast as she walked. She already consumed a lot of extra calories to work as a mechanic, so people teased her about it. But Nora could not shake the physical anguish to put off putting on fat and curling her lip to say more than polite things after taking offense—much anymore.

Another year and age would change her hair along with her face, not exactly the way she hoped, but it was changing anyway. Her dark hair was shot through with silver now. And while hair coloring had plenty of uses besides flattering, if she lived for long enough she would out-grow much of what plagued her when storms raged overhead threatening to fill every crack and vent.

Nora wished the wind would stop howling outside. On a planet like this one, some winds were unpredictable because it remained difficult to predict local weather patterns. They might grow lethally strong in minutes before dying down again. Or within seconds overnight and almost undetectable upon awakening.

Some engineers slept during their assigned shifts. Nora heard rumors about a few of those actually stumbling off to crash on the rooftop catwalks when the campus grew crowded enough, but Nora was too selfish to join them. She wanted time alone to collect her thoughts while she walked and contemplated life before her assignment here began.

Before anyone else on the walkway noticed her, available table space opened up fifty feet ahead of her and a table was pulled into place. The artisan claimed his table with a roll of the eyes. It wasn't even dawn yet, but by local standards he must have been eager for something hot, otherwise there would be no point in eating breakfast first thing. Nora knew he wouldn't tolerate interference from another engineer as he did himself. Everyone hated it when Sully cracked petty jokes or played pranks, especially engineering geeks like that guy. A girl who spent her mornings walking at top speed only to spend endless hours hunched over terminals didn't really need the attention of assholes. Still, Nora had learned to avoid some of the classes where he taught as much as possible because everyone wanted to detest him from afar.

The cafeteria filled quickly with a mix of company employees and seasonal residents as soon as people saw the table where the artisan sat.

",0.4280612244897962,-0.10795918367346857,0.01612244897959192
402,0.9,0.7,1.0,90.0,9,42.0,"Because their arms were too short for the usefulness of what was sold to them at the market, she instead walked the few minutes to the food hall where a large cafeteria filled the service lobby. Sociable silence, however, descending over other colonists, told her she was so much alone that people chose the quiet company of their own thoughts.

She made her way toward the counter. Most days, neither hunger nor thirst could thwart the quest for food. But this time, with an excited skip in her step, Nora reached the sliding door to the kitchen. Her mouth watered when she saw the rows of steaming food rotating on top of giant industrial silver plate heaters. Behind the serving lines, employees busily cleaned and prepped at their stations while cooks rotated front rounds of freshly ordered food.

Pulsing promises enticed her until she spotted a long line of waiting colonists shuffling into the meat section, blue soiled uniforms contrasting sharply with the bright utilitarian decor of the dining area. Their lack of urgency fired Nora's enthusiasm further as she joined them.

A glance around told Nora that all but one employee was a clone of herself. Clones had been used for decades to help the Company finance its many ventures, and ongoing corporate research ensured their technological development continued through genetic engineering. Hers was a tall, slim woman who looked like Nora if Nora had slept more, lacked her morning saliva, and dried out at the hairline.

""Sully! Wake up!"" Nora shouted impatiently.

The woman turned from where she efficiently washed dishes, then raised an inquiring eyebrow as though to ask what the shouting was about. She nodded politely to several of the nearby colonists with ""Good morning,"" and returned her attention to the glassware in front of her.

Nora didn't care. The food hall's long lines were designed for efficiency, not personal communication or greetings. Food was the priority, so Nora marched past her on-shift assistants without so much as a nod. A quick squirt from a panel on one wall displayed the facility's status. On Nora's left, giant text fluttered beneath a readout that tracked each dish's progress. To the right, glowing red lines marked sections of high demand along with orders which hadn't yet been replenished. But even the most efficient order system could only handle so fast. For now, there wasn't enough time for Nora to wait through all the lines.

The meat counter offered beef, chicken, pork, rabbit, and mutton. On her first trip through, she didn't make a purchase because it would have meant waiting in line. But hunger was too strong. The nearest freezer filled with cooked meals, ready to be heated frozen, grabbed dozens of sealed containers, leaving no room in the fridge behind them. Nora quickly grabbed six packages and rushed out before her original spot was reclaimed by another customer, whistling merrily to herself.

",0.4280612244897962,-0.007959183673468595,0.01612244897959192
403,0.9,0.7,1.0,66.0,10,39.0,"A few other colonists were already in the galley waiting for their meals. But Nora passed them without a glance. A heavy workbag sat at her side, ready to be filled under duress during the day; she ignored it while choosing her food.

Quietly, Nora bypassed rank in line for a seat at dual counters that sat beneath massive display screens flickering with orange numerals and rows of microphones. Tables snaked out from each counter corner, where several employees struggled to serve all the hungry colonists.

Among the colony's workers was Sully Carmichael. Nice looking, Nora reflected absently, but he waved her over with a quick smile as though nothing had happened. Ordinarily, Nora would've glowed at such a pleasant gesture, considering how oafishly polite most adults and supervisors around Presley's Promise seemed to be. But right now, Nora contemplated using a concrete rolling pin to salvage his blush. It'd feel good. Instead, she just sat down beside him and waited for her food. Red-coated sausages and hash browns lined large trays next to eggs fried so hard they cracked when dropped on curved metal pans, which promptly sizzled into oily crisps near an incandescent grill built into the wood-veneered base of one counter. Big tables lined the surrounding walls full of squat stations where everyone could plug in their own datapads to order fresh, cooked by microwave ovens that heated up so quickly nothing remained inside them until the cook manually programmed them to do so again.

Food really is as big a problem here, Nora mused idly when she looked out the window at the vast steaming plates outside the kitchen. When none of her breakfast came out hot, Nora ordered something to take away instead; cutting back drastically on the rations available to everyone but fortunate enough to receive shipments from Earth. But the items were too intentionally disgusting for Nora's taste. Most colonists preferred coarse porridge, maintaining cultural traditions that hadn't changed much during a century or more. Unmolded chunks of grain toasted under lights above hot grills and shouted ""Yeah!"" was apparently the extent of Earthian nostalgia after all. Nora rejected another plate of thin-sliced meat slathered in brown gravy before sinking teeth into the fluffy bun native to planet's landmass. Still room left for toast, she began idly tearing apart the rest of her meal and stuck it in her mouth, chewing concise little bits.

A few other diners had complaints about their meals, but those weren't major problems: Their food was simply inferior by several standards. So, through the oddities of human appetite and desire, Nora ate large amounts of all kinds of stuff. Every time, however, she found herself thinking about how fresh supplies of raw ingredients never came. If only the natives didn't have such an abysmal taste in cookery.

Nora regretted not having helped make last night's dinner. She would've felt helpful and put everyone at ease. Perhaps she should ask Dr. Carmichael for a recipe. Good thing they didn't expect proper mechanical engineering work;

404,0.9,0.7,1.0,74.0,11,43.0,"She peered toward the common area where some industrious colonists were already washing up, rinsed vessels, and tilting their heads so they could look at personal monitors perched above each sink. For the first time since becoming unemployed she felt gratitude for Company credits which dried up assets and health savings accounts, not just salaries and wages. With real money in her hands it wouldn't be long until Nora collected the wages from her next two shifts and made use of the sauna showers, massages, rehabilitation therapies... anything else within Company credits.

A gentle nudge brought her attention back to reality. Nora spared a scowl for Neir Franklin, who was glaring at another console as if ordering it around might work its magic. Okay, okay. So many channels to tune into, but which one would yield reliable intelligence? She had more practical skills after four years of college than most people ever got in ten lifetimes.

Nora propped herself on the counter and tried to spot warning signs in the mixture of fault codes a list of hastily-typed status reports suggested. At least this colony had redundancies. In the adjoining kitchen, Moira Bell viewed the screens over breakfast with more alacrity, removing one item of food at each suggestion displayed before politely rejecting other suggestions. The special rations exhausted for the day's mandatory break were sitting in the refrigerator beside an assortment of jams and fruit they preserved themselves when fresh supplies failed to appear during seasonal shortages. Around the room, colonists prepared their meals en masse, unaware that mealtime was conspicuously redundant.

The angular dining table shone white metal plated with red rubberized material. Moira pushed a jam jar toward Nora and mused for only the merest moment about which jars held fruit preserves in stock – knowledge imparted to her courtesy of the late Tobias, a provider from a distant planet they couldn't afford medical care as much as the Company could have afforded it... Nora smothered her throat full of melancholy at thought of Tobias, then focused like a laser on what she needed.

She hesitated at the door. Here came winter with freezing temperatures and curtailed access to heat generators. Her toes got chilly and rubbed together painfully in shoes she had left inside in defiance of cold weather regulations. But conditions on the ground would be worse today if she grounded her boots in the snow that covered everything for miles around. And ran out of power in that case, warming the pod... or slept an additional hour while the generator warmed the air.

With a sigh, Nora bent over the console and tapped functions, starting each screen by setting up the alarm again to wake the lazy people in Colony Control. That would teach them. The mistake was their responsibility; no rescue likely in case of emergency until it could get here in time anyway.

Nora wasn't wrong about that. After leaning on those data points for a moment to cringe inwardly, she started off at speed. Time to deliver information to someone who knew what to do with it.

",0.4280612244897962,-0.007959183673468595,0.01612244897959192
405,0.9,0.8,1.0,63.0,8,42.0,"Two guards were waiting in the hall, armed as ever. So far so good. They held themselves straight at attention, their eyes front but alert to every possible threat. One of them watched Nora's progress beneath lowered lashes.

She chose not to acknowledge him. Most of the other colonists scoffed at such rigid discipline, at least when it came to keeping body parts under wraps, but Nora always kept this guard at courtly alertness, insisting that everyone wear the protective gear. If she didn't think they could be trusted to fight back against enemies like foreign intruders bent on stealing resources, then she wouldn't trust anyone she locked inside the perimeter.

At the end of another long corridor, there was a small indoor lagoon with steam curling up from its surface. Panels slid aside as an electronic hologram called her forward. She rapped on the glass, earning a sharp glance from the guards where they stood post nearby. Her application wasn't any more urgent than the next person's. But when the device in question clattered across Nora's palm, one guard quirked an eyebrow at her.

""All personnel are clear for ISSIntruderIsle trial run,"" it said politely. ""Please proceed to the launch bay.""

Nora kept walking until the guard followed, watching her surreptitiously as she strode past to join the group of six colonists gathered near a large vault door. Each sat leaning on his or her own ORD intellacase workstation, which raised the rebellion of wrinkles around their mouths and swapped the tension away from their brows.

Nora grunted. She knew they'd try to outsmart the security system, but they didn't need to know how long it took to crack the SafeLand System's primary codes. Not if she could get them through the Vault without anyone seeing it, that was.

""Hey, guys,"" Nora said as she reached the cluster. The console in her hand lit up, showing her options. She adjusted the settings with deft fingers.

On the other side of the complex, a generator rumbled into still life. Fenzetti muttered something about generators going soft during the break, but Nora just had to show him what she could do. Later he might well thank her for saving their defenses.

At exactly the right moment she pushed home a button marked Launch, and then stepped back to watch the vault door close. For a heavy thump of silence whose diagram seemed to be made more harsh by its contrast to the hushed din of machinery elsewhere, the door sealed.

That done, the rest was easy. A sequence of coded changes and maneuvers closed the network, blocking all tangential routes. A cleansing purge swept the colony clean, erasing any lingering electronic impulses or hidden viruses from every system. Then—with the reaction control jets' spin locked in position—Roanid floated on the walls of space to await instructions.

406,0.9,0.8,1.0,54.0,10,39.0,"The company cafeteria was noisy and surprisingly cosmopolitan despite its close proximity to the rocky cliffs outside. The whole place smelled like sour grease, burned coffee, stale pastry, and sweat. Cans of food lined shelves on one wall while tables took up much of the remaining space. At each table, people sat around uneasily in direct line of sight to all other tables. Everyone wore a uniform made only slightly less rustic by sufficient amounts of color and design from what Nora had seen of Company uniforms back home. If they were still wearing the same thing as yesterday, their clothing could be crumpled, bloody, or even torn through days of construction work and fires – Nora knew she would never wear anything but the most basic clothing at this point.

She sipped her instant midmorning beverage, which tasted mostly... brown. The sound of chatting customers drowned out everything else. A metal cart groaned to life outside while circulating low-grade caffeine matrix through channelled steam at extremely high pressure, effectively steaming the air full of flavorless scented vapors with a medicinal aftertaste. As Nora waited for the clink and scrape of a fork being set down, she smiled ruefully to herself. Even someplace as depressing as this was nice to have IAPA signal support, and upgrades that allowed instant jam packs. It didn't make the land outright attractive, though.

A companion from next shift helped situate Nora's tray on the dividing line between his seat and hers across two narrow adjoining tables. ""Hey,"" Colton murmured as he handed her a sandwich claimed by another colleague. ""Good morning you."" He turned to munching a mouthful of food. Though no blatant displays of affection occurred, Nora felt the physical sensation of having someone genuinely say hello when she was alone in her job and time zone, an uncommon occurrence so far away from home. She blinked once in surprise then shrugged it off.

He leaned around an acquaintance to grin speculatively at Nora, hazel eyes bright over a round face framed by jet-black hair. His clean shaven jaw gleamed under the overhead lights, pinkly visible because of sheer crimson droplets of blood caught in just one thinly trimmed eyelash. An irregularity in his skull shone dully against reddened skin where the kraken had closed the gape left by the explosion that destroyed part of the mining facility where he worked. Symmetry would've made him look handsome but broken parts gave him a disconcertingly asymmetrical, plastic appearance.

An idle smile ducked on Nora's lips as she replaced her toothpick behind crooked teeth graced by a hint of dimple. ""Good morning to yourself, Colton,"" she said politely before realizing what she'd done – his first name hadn't been mentioned since the early days, and the nickname was only used in informal company environments. Besides, she still had no idea how to use it accurately in English. ""You're here earlier than expected today,"" she groused with a nod indicated for him to help himself.

""Yeah,"" Colton agreed between bites.

Nora attempted not to think about the dangerous aliens that lurked beneath them, growing stronger by the day. It wasn't hard; Nora kept her eyes glued to Colton. He looked relaxed and easy while eating his portions, paying little attention to the crew over their other meals.

407,0.9,0.8,1.0,68.0,10,39.0,"As she rounded a narrow hallway towards what passed for a restroom by this outpost – just a cramped space with two taps provided the colonists – a single company executive walked from one end of the corridor to the other. His footsteps boomed loudly against the slick metal alloy beneath heavy boots and rubber soles, pounding along walls where even small cracks joined wider fractures around larger spans of sheetrock. The sound echoed as loud in the empty halls as it did above and below over wide expanses of harsh outdoors exposed in any direction to the chilly cold winds blowing outside.

Each step seemed an endless grey silhouette measuring Nora back down another little bit, growing smaller and more distant like each minute bore her further and further into limbo. A feeling that consumed every bit of energy came with his passage, roiling inward through cobwebs in her skull until it threatened to become actual pain.

At last he reached the end of the hall, taking the final turn with aggravating pomp and showmanship. He turned abruptly. Spinning about twice at full speed, then a third time, he deepened his voice for the official report to begin by calling out ""Colonel! Good morning!""

The governor, Colonel Strauss, snapped upright and pushed his way past the dangling tail on an unruly mop of unkempt brown hair. While his typical uniform included utility pants with high cut pockets for carrying tools or weapons and a long sleeve shirt with buttons up the front to hold them, it was now only half buttoned and several flexible polymer plates lay crumpled and discolored across his chest. As Nora watched, the colonel's bushy eyebrows narrowed into thin trenches above brooding eyes set deeply under strands of gray brows, casting a sinister expression over his face as Governor Noble fully comprehended where he had found himself this morning.

""I should have known that something would happen,"" von Noble added crossly, barely below audible volume, in clipped tones. ""Orange alert? I knew it! Then again..."" Straightening at Nora's gaze led, of course, to snarky mutterings behind him as diplomats and advisers tried to catch up with their counterparts around him. ""... I thought I'd gotten away with turning off the status lights on my own office doors.""

""Haven't you, sir?"" another answered sardonically. ""You own that chair.""

Nora was aware of how she looked. Narrow hips, broad shoulders, and lean muscles unmarked by even forty years of hard work, made her well-adapted for the rigors of living and working on a remote planet where basic food needed to be tracked down and gathered from what amounted to nature's wild garden. The outdoors also provided plenty of things to hurt one besides poisonous plants. Her math professor mother was convinced Nora should consider a career as an explorer, but Nora couldn't imagine trying life in some pristine wilderness.

408,0.9,0.9,1.0,73.0,10,45.0,"The walkways were made flush to other structures and surfaces, leaving no black spaces on the ground, so that Nora could take a full breath without tasting soil. The cold felt good as it knocked static tingles from her mind. The night air still held grit, but she hadn't been asleep long enough for it to become papery dust.

There was no question of turning back after a measly few hours'sleep; she was needed in operations, where colonists worked in teams trying to repair failing machinery. Anyone who wasn't working on repairs - usually the engineers themselves - would be trying to figure out what went wrong. Food was short because people couldn't use their showers, never mind fiddle with unreliable power systems. If she lost even one person to a broken piece of equipment...

The empty assembly bay buzzed with noise inside its walls, but work felt slower than usual. Right now, anything might set off alarms. Nora didn't know how this hive worked or what swarms of drones did when they weren't stranding humans at random – animalistic aberrations or clever tactics designed for getting them into trouble? Resources were precious, and every meter of floor space in the colony had to be used efficiently.

Nora handled personal items like a teenager sneaking out to buy illicit goods on payday. You can relax too much otherwise. The toll of constant anxiety wore her nerves down until they snapped, and she could hardly calm herself while heading to break room for something hot to drink and replenish her energy reserves.

Unusual equipment failures made Nora tense sometimes. She kept prowling between work stations, holding onto hope that the next breakdown didn't include some critical failure that would put someone in danger she couldn't do a thing about. A chill crept up her spine from base of her neck as she stalked toward the engineering bays, palms moist with anticipation or freezing cold despite the jacket's temperature controls, willing the next delay to solve itself before it happened.

Nora was familiarized with the layout as she shuttled back and forth all morning to break room. She knew the unexpected malfunctions better than she wanted. Each time an alarm blared, Nora tucked her own tail and side-stepped into a wall or shadow. Hardware repairs were always worse when there wasn't enough warning. When confronted with a problem, Nora tried first to fix it herself and only admitted defeat if she had exhausted all repair options. If she failed to fix the problem fast enough, then other colonists would have to help out in shifts that stretched weeks at a time until everyone graduated through so many iterations of the same situation.

After hours of uneasy waiting beside malfunctioning equipment, Nora understood why grunts muttered too quiet to hear about how much they loathed work even if something went wrong when you were right on top of it. On days like this, Nora looked forward to leaving as soon as possible, walking out into the sky where the blasted landscape below her promised relief. As she neared the back end of colony life, she imagined chopping parts off a malfunctioning machine with a sledgehammer and seeing body parts lobbed to pteranodon carrioners as she fled. That's where Nora eventually said good-bye to her dreams of escape.

She wondered briefly if anyone saw her now, but rather than invite questions by turning back, Nora braced herself and kept going.

Nora entered the mess hall. Although construction crews were continuing to perform maintenance, broken, dead, malfunctioning, or fresh improvements from engineering teams it had paid for with Company funding were scattered about. Doors opened at regular intervals onto small adjoining rooms. Some served dining services, others storage spaces, and a few remained sealed.

The room was packed wall to wall. Small tables and chairs crowded the space, leaving little standing area. Lined up against one side were an array of food service personnel. Most wore coveralls that hung loosely off lean frames. A few of the workers engaged in quiet conversations with each other. On the far side, two men and a woman sat across from a robotic chef in what appeared to be business attire before a vista of rows and rows of diners—or consumers.

All three turned in Nora's direction as she moved through the mass of bodies. One man stood, rising unsteadily as he clasped his hand down upon his prosthetic arm. The damage of one freak accident or another after too many jobs wearing powered exoskeletons, but on account of his age and years spent in industry his body had not yet adjusted fully to the new mobility. In fact, long ago that injury combined with hard labor use had caused most of the joint's joints to become permanently locked back in any position other than straight out. He was trapped in motionless tension, slight lids drooping upon excessively bright pools of aug-unblinking eyes.

Nora gave him nothing save her wrinkled brow in passing. Little bubbles built on the chittering susurrations around her as everyone drawn to this newcomer glanced docilely away.

Tall windows, which framed the view beyond them, glinted. Nora marched up to one and pressed both hands flat to it. It emitted a faint whirring. As she lifted her arms back underneath, a panel beneath slid open.

Despite its transformative gap, allowing for easier ingress and egress in terms of egress and ingress (for new recruits entering or exiting while hosts pass by), the windowless room still possessed one wall that had no door except where it met the end of the hall. Nora rested her shoulder against the cool metal on the far side of the opening pane and surveyed the chamber.

Nora placed her hands in front of an old touchscreen. It flashed at least ten dozen colors. Her arms briskly pushed aside these layers of windows until her target image resolved from disarrayed chaos. She settled into an inhale long enough to set the console to optimum affinity, then tapped.

A map popped up on the screen. Nora peered at it contemplatively, as though seeing a new section of city emerging before her through the foggy haze overhead. Dark lines stretched between points of light;

410,0.9,0.9,1.0,83.0,8,42.0,"After donning her boots—never taking off the socks, those came instantly after a hot soak in water heated through steam—she pulled the goggles over her eyes, bundled up against the chill, and threw the hood of the jacket on her shoulders. Her thick hair was still a tousled mess, however, so she resorted to brushing it back while stepping out into the entranceway.

An exasperated sigh slipped past her lips.

The entrance opened onto one side of the expansive dining room, gleaming white walls intersected by rows of long, dark wood tables. Facing the other way was a living arrangement that combined kitchen use, workout room and equipment storage. Frequent wispy clouds of vapor drifted across glimpses of pale blue light shining through glass windows along the walls like streams of moving stars.

So far, Nora hadn't seen any signs of life until the machine bleeped at her. But then some might be sleeping after working for hours again today. Most aren't likely to show up before meals anyway.

Behind one of the eateries, the kitchen door opened under the force of a bellow from an oven's control panel. A tall woman with blonde hair and freckles pushed through the rocking door, dressed in a sleeveless catsuit top that left her midriff bare and cut off just above her knees, utility pants, and knee-high boots.

She smiled as she spotted Nora, acknowledging their mutual lack of garments with a single raised brow before setting her hands on hips to focus unfairly on the undersides of the goggles.

""Come on, Nora, you wore your jacket inside. Don't forget you're still wearing socks.""

""I've been in bed as long as I am going to. The alarm went off at oh-eight hundred knots. Getting attacked is considered an emergency?"" Nora flipped up her collar against a cold gust of air that slipped down the new shoulder hole in the jacket but settled instead around her neck when it clenched against her throat, warm and dry enough to leave dampness on her skin. ""No use arguing if we want to eat breakfast in here,"" she added, straightening up even more than the casual gesture demanded. ""Is Anders out there?""

""He isn't currently, no,"" Wylie said, pulling a small pouch from behind her belt. She pulled a white hatchling—the entire apparatus was gold filigree and leather, highly polished and firmly attached to its holster—and held it up for Nora's inspection. Huge black eyes blinked emptily at Nora through the network of blue, green, and purple lines that crisscrossed their surfaces. At close range, they were beautiful, reminding Nora a bit of how even swarthy Mei's face had looked in the morning sun overhead earlier in the year.

Wylie gave Nora an impressed smile before slipping it back into the pouch. ""Have you ever seen one like this before? It helps him keep track of where he is in space.""

Nora shook her head with wonder.

The younger woman chuckled, affectedly girlish again as she tucked the recovered pistol into her hip pocket.
